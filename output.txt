Sheet2~D1~M1~Methodology~Population Regression~Y=B0(VEVit)+B1(VEVit) x POSTt, whereas B1 measures the differential change in the outcome variable of interest, Y, for Vietnam era veterans following the policy change, and where POSTt is equal to 0 in the years prior to the policy change and subsequently equal to 0.5 in the period during and after the policy change.
Sheet2~D1~F7~Findings~B1 After policy change~…highly significant point of estimate of -3.21 indicates that between 2001 and 2005, labor force participation of vietnam era veteran males fell by more than 3% relative to that of similarly aged nonveteran males.
Sheet2~D1~F8~Findings~Vietnam Era Veteran Labor Force Participation~…was higher than that of nonveterans in the pre-policy period by 0.36%, however this difference was insignificant.
Sheet2~D1~F9~Findings~Vietnam Era Veteran Labor Force Exit~…veterans not significantly more likely than nonveterans to be out of the labor force for reasons other than retirement or disability.
Sheet2~D1~F10~Findings~Vietnam Era Veteran Self-Reported disability~…after 2001, veterans were significantly more likely to report a work-limiting disability or health condition relative to nonveteran males of the same age suggesting that there was a dfferential decline in the health of veterans after 2001 or that those who receive disability payments are more likely to report themselves as disabled.
Sheet2~D1~F11~Findings~Vietnam Era Veteran Unearned income~…after 2001, veterans were significantly more likely to receive unearned income from the Veterans Administration or Social Security Administration reflecting a combination of disability and pension payments.
Sheet2~D1~F12~Findings~Vietnam Era Veteran Self Reported disability prior to 2001~…even before VDC policy change, Veterans were 11% more likely than non veterans to report a work-limiting disability suggesting that nonveteran males are an imperfect comparison group for veteran males of the similar age.
Sheet2~D1~V7~Variable~Unearned Income~…resulting from the expansion of the VDC program's medical eligibility criteria in 2001 substantially reduced labor force participation among Vietnma-era veterans.
Sheet2~D1~V2~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…was substantially reduced after VDC program expanded medical eligibility critieria in 2001 resulting in an increase in unearned income for Vietnam-era veterans.
Sheet2~D1~F13~Findings~Affect of VDC Program~…large behavorial responses to the program are noteworthy given that the program does not affect the incentive to work as does the SSDI program and its means tested counterparts of the Supplemental Security Income program. Suggesting that income effects on labor supply may be sizable for near-elderly adults in moderate to poor health.
Sheet2~D1~F14~Findings~Differences in Vietnam-era veteran and nonveteran males~…the differential declines in labor supply observed here may have occurred even in the absence of this policy change, suggesting that a definitive test of labor supply response to the VDC policy change is dependant on better data.
Sheet2~D1~F15~Findings~Substitution vs. Income effects~…it is plausible that a significant share of the reductions in labor force participation associated with receipt of disability benefits is explained by income effects rather than a substitution effect.
Sheet2~D1~F16~Findings~Labor Force Participation~…when granted permanent, inflation-indexed income and government provided health insurance, many near-elderly adults in moderate to poor health may prefer an early retirement to continued labor force participation.
Sheet2~D1~F17~Findings~Further Study~…further study of the effect of the labor supply effects of the VDC program is warranted.
Sheet2~D1~F18~Findings~Percent of Veterans enrolled in VDC~…VDC program currently provides cash benefits and health insurance to more than 11% of military veterans.

Sheet3~D1~F11~Findings~College Educated Women with Five-Year Cohort Dummies~…when college educated women, specify five-year dummies ,and instrument for the wage, the coefficient is -0.29 and marginally significant.
Sheet3~D1~F12~Findings~All Men and College-Educated Men~…corresponding regressions found the estimate of the coefficient to be generally insignificant or negative.
Sheet3~D1~F13~Findings~Women's Response to Skill Demand~…while women's response to rising skill demand may be greater than men's, the within-cohort response to rising skill demand is limited, and much of the response is exhibited across birth cohorts.

Sheet3~D1~F14~Findings~Wages and Participation~…there exists a strong positive relationship between wages and professional participation of college educated women even when controlled for a trend.
Sheet3~D1~F15~Findings~Positive Correlation led by Cohort Growth Rate~…the positive correlation seems to be driven by below-average growth rates for the oldest cohorts and above average growth rates for the middle and youngest cohorts.
Sheet3~D1~F16~Findings~Positive Correlation led by Opportunity~…the positive correlation across cohorts suggests that college educated women have moved into high wage professional occupations in response to increasing opportunites.
Sheet3~D1~F17~Findings~Positive Correlation led by Skill Demand~…it is less clear that these increasing opportunities were directly related to skill demand rather than reductions in discrimination.
Sheet3~D1~F18~Findings~College Educated Women's Professional Participation~... in high wage professional occupations is positively correlated with wages in these profesional occupations and the researchers' proxy measures of skill demand.

121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…the current research identifies the effect of recessions on beliefs exploiting time and regional variation in macroeconomic conditions using data from the 1972 to 2010 General Social Survey.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the current model specifications control for nonlinear time-period, life-cycle, and cohort effects, as well as a host of background variables.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…the current research relies on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 to corroborate the age-period-cohort specification and look at heterogeneous effects of experiencing a recession during early adulthood.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…using data from the World Value Survey, researchers confirm the findings with a sample of 37 countries whose citizens experienced macroeconomic disasters at different points in history.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…relying on pooled cross-sectional data from the 1972 to 2010 General Social Survey (GSS), researchers use regional variation in macroeconomic conditions in the United States to identify the impact of economic shocks on the formation of preferences for redistribution.
121~D1~T1~Time Period~1972-2010~…survey period from which cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey is drawn.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the key challenge in any study of preference formation is the appropriate control of omitted variables: a cohort of individuals shares a large number of experiences, from economic shocks to technological progress to a multitude of unobservable characteristics. This makes the identification of macroeconomic shocks almost impossible if researchers use only cross-time variation. For this reason, the identification strategy hinges on cross-regional variation in individual experiences during the impressionable years. 
121~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Time-Specific Shocks~…using the information on respondent's location during adolescence, researchers rely on time- and location-specific shocks.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…using the information on respondent's location during adolescence, researchers rely on time- and location-specific shocks. This specification allows researchers to control for nonlinear time-period, and life-cycle and cohort effects, as well as a host of background variables and other time-varying regional characteristics, including level of wealth, differences in educational policies, overall level of inequality and crime.

121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…the findings from the U.S.-based GSS data are confirmed by extending the analysis to a large set of countries. Researchers do so by linking preferences for redistribution to experiences of economic disasters during youth in a sample of 37 countries, using evidence from the World Value Survey.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS72) is utilized to corroborate the age-period-cohort specificationa and shed light on the mechanisms driving the results.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Preferences~…for all of the analysis, researchers use a variety of selfg-reported measures of preferences for government intervention.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…for all of the analysis, researchers use a variety of selfg-reported measures of preferences for government intervention.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Political Behavior~…to show that subjective measures are a good approximation of underlying behavior, researchers also examine the validity of these self-reported measures by comparing them with several objective measures of political behavior, including ideology, party affiliation, and voting behavior in the most recent election. 
121~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Impressionable Years Recession and Redistribution Beliefs~…overall, it is found that experiencing a recession when young permanently increases the individual desire for redistribution. The effect is statistically significant and economically meaningful, and is robust across three different datasets and for a variety of specifications.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…to gauge the economic significance of the findings, researchers construct a exercise, using evidence from the GSS, of what would have happened to the percentage of people voting for the Democratic Party in the most recent election in the nine U.S. regions, if individuals living in that region had not experienced a recession when young.

121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in the current empirical analysis, researchers also look at the presence of heterogeneous effects.
121~D1, D4~F2~Findings~Impressionable Years Recession, Education, and Wealth~…overall, researchers find that the effect of experiecing a recession when young is quite general and persistent, with a slightly stronger effect for less educated and poorer people. This evidence suggests that at least part of the recession effect is amplified by the personal conditions of the individuals during the recession.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…the primary dataset on individual and political beliefs is the General Social Survey (GSS), which provides repeated cross-section observations on political and economic beliefs and various individual characteristics.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…the GSS, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, is a nationally representative sample for the United States of about 1,500 respondents each year from 1972 through 1993 (except for 1979, 1981, and 1992). It continues biennially, with 3,000 observations from 1994 to 2004, 4,500 observations in 2006, and 2,000 observations in 2008 and 2010. Researchers use all the data available from 1972 to 2010.
121~D1~T1~Time Period~1972-2010~…the GSS is a nationally represenative sample for the United States of about 1,500 respondents each year from 1972 through 1993 (except for 1979, 1981, and 1992). It continues biennially, with 3,000 observations from 1994 to 2004, 4,500 observations in 2006, and 2,000 observations in 2008 and 2010.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the key variables for the relevant analysis are several measures of preferences for redistribution and political behavior as dependent variables and a region measure of macroeconomic shock as an explanatory variable.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~"…as measures for preferences for redistribution, researchers use the answers to three questions from the GSS referred to as ""help poor"", ""assistance poor"", and ""work-luck""."
121~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Preferences~"…as measures for preferences for redistribution, researchers use the answers to three questions from the GSS referred to as ""help poor"", ""assistance poor"", and ""work-luck""."
121~D1~V3~Variable~Help Poor~"…the relevant GSS question is as follows: ""Some people think that the government in Washington should do everything to improve the standard of living of all poor Americans (they are at point 5 on this card). Other people think that it is not the government's responsibility, and that each person should take care of himself (they are at point 1). Where are you placing yourself in this scale?"" This is referred to as ""help poor."""
121~D1~V4~Variable~Assistance Poor~"…the relevant GSS question is as follows: ""We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I am going to name some of these problems, and for each one I would like you to tell me whether you think we are spending too much money on it, too little money or about the right amount."" A list of items follows, including ""assistance to the poor."" Researchers coded the variable so that a higher number indicates too little assistance to the poor. This is named ""assistance poor."""
121~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Work Luck~"…the relevant GSS question is as follows: ""Some people say that people get ahead by their own hard work; others say that lucky breaks or help from other people are most important. Which do you think is most important?"" The answer can take a value from 1 to 3: hard work is most important (1), hard work and luck are equally important (2), luck is important (3). This is referred to as ""work-luck."""
121~V5~L1~Variable Value~Hard Work Is Most Important~"…a ""work luck"" value of (1) corresponds to the ifact that the respondent believes hard work is most important relative to luck."
121~V5~L2~Variable Value~Hard Work and Luck are Equally Important~"…a ""work luck"" value of (2) corresponds to the ifact that the respondent believes hard work and luck are equally important."
121~V5~L3~Variable Value~Luck is Most important~"…a ""work luck"" value of (3) corresponds to the ifact that the respondent believes luck is most important relative to hard work."
121~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Work Luck~…the theoretical motivation for using this last preference measures is that an individual who believes that luck is the major determinant of economic success is expected to favor government redistribution; in contrast, an individual who believes in the importance of personal hard work is expected to oppose redistribution.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…the survey is conduced face-to-face with an in-person interview by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago of a randomly selected sample of adults (18 and older) who are not institutionalized. The survey takes about 90 minutes to administer.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Preferences~…one concern when interpreting questions on preferences for redistribution is whether they are an accurate measure of underlying preferences. If self-reported preferences for redistribtion reflect underlying preferences, then they should correspond to voting behavior and political ideology.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Political Behavior~"…researchers examine the validity of self-reported preference measures by looking at three different measures of political behavior corresponding to the three questions including ""political ideology,"" ""party affiliation,"" and ""voting Democrat."""

121~D1, D3~V6~Variable~Political Ideology~"…the relevant GSS question is as follows: ""We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I am going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal to extremely conservative. Where would you place yourself in this scale?"" Researchers coded the question so that a higher number corresponds to extremely liberal. The answer to the question is referred to as ""political ideology."""
121~V6~L4~Variable Value~Extremely Liberal~"…a ""political ideology"" value of (7) corresponds to extremely liberal."
121~D1, D3~V7~Variable~Party Affiliation~"…the relevant GSS question is as follows: ""Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, Democrat, Independent, or what?"" Researchers dropped from the analysis people who answered ""other party, refused to say"" or ""don't know."" The answer to this question is referred to as party affiliation."
121~V7~L5~Variable Value~Strong Democrat~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (6) corresponds to strong Democrat."
121~V7~L6~Variable Value~Not Very Strong Democrat~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (5) corresponds to not very strong Democrat."
121~V7~L7~Variable Value~Independent, Close to Democra~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (4) corresponds to independent, close to Democrat."
121~V7~L8~Variable Value~Independent~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (3) corresponds to independent."
121~V7~L9~Variable Value~Independent, Close to Republican~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (2) corresponds to independent, close to Republican."
121~V7~L10~Variable Value~Not Very Strong Republican~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (1) corresponds to not very strong Republican."
121~V7~L11~Variable Value~Strong Republican~"…a ""party affiliation"" value of (0) corresponds to strong Republican."
121~D1~V8~Variable~Voting Democrat~…the third political measure, voting Democrat, is based on whether the respondent voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in the most recent election. Researchers eliminated those observations where individuals either did not vote or voted for an independent candidate.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…researchers use as a measure of macroeconomic shocks large, regional recessions (as opposed to statewide recessions).
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…the GSS contains information on census regions (but not on single states) in which the person was living when he or she was 16. Researchers use this information to match individuals with the macroeconomic shock in the region where the person was living during his or her youth.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…the GSS contains information on census regions (but not on single states) in which the person was living when he or she was 16. Researchers use this information to match individuals with the macroeconomic shock in the region where the person was living during his or her youth.
121~D1~V10~Variable~Region-at-16~…the census region in which the person was living when he or she was 16 as reported by the GSS.
121~D1~V10~Variable~Region-at-16~"…researchers assume that the individual was living during his or her ""impressionable years"" in the region where he or she was living at 16."
121~D1, D3~V7~Variable~Party Affiliation~"…in some model specifications, researchers exclude from the analysis people who answered ""independent"" without any indication of whether they are close to Republican or Democrat."
121~D1~V10~Variable~Region-at-16~"…one problem with assigning the region of residence at 16 to the whole ""impressionable years"" period is that people could have moved during that period. The extent to which people moved during their impressionable years introduces measurement error that could bias the results toward zero."
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers address the problem associated with moving during the impressionable year period by running regressions on a subsample of individuals who lived, at the time of interview, in the same region where they lived at 16.
121~D4~D4~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…to have the longest possible time series, researchers contruct a measure of regional recessions using the data on region personal income from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
121~D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Per Capita Income~…to have the longest possible time series, researchers contruct a measure of regional recessions using the data on region personal income from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…to have the longest possible time series, researchers contruct a measure of regional recessions using the data on region personal income from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
121~D4~D4~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…the Bureau of Economic Analysis has been providing annual estimates of per capita personal income at the state level since 1929.
121~D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Per Capita Income~…researchers construct a measure of real per capita personal income using data on state personal income and population, adjusted for inflation.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~"…for a dependent variable, researchers construct a variable equal to 1 if the individual experienced at least one year in which the real regional per capita GDP growth was lower than -3.4% during his or her ""impressionable years"" and zero otherwise. This threshold represents the lowest 10th percentile of the GDP growth distribution for the nine U.S. regions from 1929 to 2010."
121~D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Real Regional Per Capita GDP Growth~"…the real regional per capita GDP growth, determined in order to derive a binary regional recession variable equal to 1 if the individual experienced at least one year in which the real regional per capita GDP growth was lower than -3.4% during his or her ""impressionable years"" and zero otherwise. "
121~DV13~L12~Variable Value~Less than -3.4%~…this real regional per capita GDP growth rate threshold represents the lowest 10th percentile of the GDP growth distribution for the nine U.S. regions from 1929 to 2010. Researchers chose the lowest 10th percentile rather than simply negative GDP growth because 80% of the individuals experienced at least one year of negative growth during the critical age period in the sample when using this definition; therefore, a shock simply defined as negative growth would not have given enough variation. Researchers could have used also the fifth-lowest percentile (corresponding to a growth rate lower than -8.4%), but the problem with that measure is that it captures only the generation who experienced a recession between 1929 and 1947.
121~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Age, Region-at-16~…an interaction between age and region used to determine the recessionary trends for various birth cohorts living in various Census regions throughout the sample period.
121~D1, D4~F3~Findings~Region, Cohort, and Recessionary Trends~...the cohorts born between 1933 and 1940 were subject to at least one year of recession if they lived in the New England, East North Central, or South Atlantic regions, but not if they lived in the other regions. For the cohorts between 1960 and 1970, as young adults, those who lived in New England experienced no recessions, but those in other regions weren't so fortunate. Around 30% of those who spent their impressionable years in the East (north or south) Central region lived through a recession, as did about 50% in the Middle Atlantic, Southern Atlantic, and Mountain regions; 70% in the West North Central region, and a whopping 90% who lived in the Pacific or West South Central regions experienced a recession during their impressionable years.
121~D4~D4~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…the BEA also compiles data on gross state product, i.e., GDP at the regional level, but dating back only to 1963. Th correlation between real per capita personal income and real per capita GDP is 0.92. Researchers could have used regional unemployment rates as a measure of macroeconomic recessions; however, this variable is available only since 1968, from the BLS. As a result, they would lose too many observations. In the longitudinal analysis (which covers 1972 to 1986), researchers can use measures of the state unemployment rates.
121~D4~V11~Variable~National CPI~…researchers use national CPI to correct for inflation.
121~D2~T2~Time Period~1972-1986~…the longitudinal analysis covers 1972 to 1986.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the baseline specification of OLS regressions has a dependent variable indicating the response to one the preference ideology above by an individual interviewed at time t in region r. Explanatory variables include  a dummy indicating whether the individual experienced a recession during the impressionable years in his or her region of residence at age 16, which is used as a reference region for the whole 18 to 25 range, and a vector of individual characteristics, including gender and race, as well as measures of income, education, marital status, and labor market status. In some specifications, researchers also include information on family background of the individual at age 16, and religious denomination.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…all specifications include age dummies and time fixed effects to control for age-specific trends in beliefs and common national history. Researchers include dummies for both the region where the persion is living and the region where the person was at 16. All of the regressions also include interactions of region-at-16 dummies with linear age trends to help rule out the possibility that results are driven by region-specific cohort effects.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…all regressions are estimated using OLS for ease of interpretation, but similar results are obtained with ordered logit or probit (depending on the specification).
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~"…standard errors are clustered at the region-at-16 level. Because of the small number of clusters, researchers correct the standard errors using the ""wild bootstrap"" procedure suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008). Computing valid confidence intervals with so few clusters is a hard problem. The results are also robust to clustering at the region*year level."
121~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Preferences~…the dependent variable in OLS regression indicating the response to one of the preference questions described above by an individual interviewed at time t in region r.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…the variable macroeconomic shock is a dummy indicating whether the individual experienced a recession during the impressionable years in his or her region of residence at 16, which is used as a reference region for the whole 18 to 25 range.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…a vector of individual characteristics, including gender and race, as well as measures of income, education, marital status, and labor market status.
121~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Male~…the GSS respondent's gender as included in a vector of individual characteristics.
121~D1, D2, D3~V13~Variable~African American~…the GSS respondent's race as included in a vector of individual characteristics.
121~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~Income~…one measure of the GSS respondent's income as included in a vector of individual characteristics.
121~D1, D2, D3~V15~Variable~Education~…the GSS respondent's education as included in a vector of individual characteristics.
121~D1, D2, D3~V16~Variable~Marital Status~…the GSS respondent's marital status as included in a vector of individual characteristics.
121~D1, D2, D3~V17~Variable~Labor Market Status~…the GSS respondent's labor market status as included in a vector of individual characteristics.
121~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Father Education~…in some model specifications, researchers include information on family background of the individual at 16 by controlling for the level of education of the father at age 16.
121~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Family Income~…in some model specifications, researchers include information on family background of the individual at 16 by controlling for his or her family income at age 16.
121~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Family Religion~…in some model specifications, researchers include information on the religious denomination of the individual by controlling for the religion in which the person was raised.
121~D1, D2, D3~V21~Variable~Current Religion~…in some model specifications, researchers include information on the religious denomination of the individual by controlling for the religion at the time of interview.
121~D1, D2, D3~V22~Variable~Age Dummies~…all specifications include age dummies and time fixed effects to control for age-specific trends in beliefs and common national history.
121~D1, D2, D3~V23~Variable~Time Fixed Effects~…all specifications include age dummies and time fixed effects to control for age-specific trends in beliefs and common national history.
121~D1~V10~Variable~Region-at-16~…dummies for the region where the person was living at 16. The addition of this variable in conjuction with the region-at-interview variable helps to control for regional ideology, both at birth and later on, and anything specific to a certain region of origin or residence that could be driving differences in beliefs.
121~D1~V24~Variable~Region-at-Interview~…dummies for the region where the person is living at the time of interview. The addition of this variable in conjuction with the region-at-16 variable helps to control for regional ideology, both at birth and later on, and anything specific to a certain region of origin or residence that could be driving differences in beliefs.
121~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Age, Region-at-16~…all regressions include interactions of region-at-16 dummies with linear trends to help reule out the possiblity that results are driven by region-specific cohort effects.
121~D1~V24~Variable~Region-at-Interview~…the region at time of interview does not correspond necessarily to the region in which the individual grew up, as individuals may have moved.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…the variable of interest, macroeconomic shocks, exhibits cross-regional variation but also variation between cohorts. 
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to control for any omitted variable that exhibits cohort-level variation, in the less parsimonious specification, researchers also include an almost full set of cohort dummies.
121~D1~V25~Variable~Birth Cohort Dummies~…to control for any omitted variable that exhibits cohort-level variation, in the less parsimonious specification, researchers also include an almost full set of cohort dummies.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in the less parsimonious specification, researchers also control for the possibility that region-specific trends could be driving the results by including a full set of region of interview and year interactions.
121~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Region-at-Interview, Year~…in the less parsimonious specification, researchers also control for the possibility that region-specific trends could be driving the results by including a full set of region of interview and year interactions.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the identification of the effects of macro shocks on beliefs comes from the fact that different regions experienced different shocks over the years. The problem with this approach is that researchers could attribute to the regional macroeconomic shock the effect of some other time-varying regional characteristics, since the macroeconomic shock is the only time-varying regional regressor included in the baseline specification. Region-at-16 dummies interacted with age linear trends in all specifications partially address this identification concern. In addition (in the robustness section of the paper), researchers also control for a large number of region-specific time-varying characteristics that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks, including various measures of crime, income inequality, educational policies, and proxies for wealth.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…the macroeconomic shock is the only time-varying regional regessor included in the baseline specification.
121~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Shocks~…macroeconomic shocks may also have an effect on an individual's endowment through education, income, or differences in labor market experiences. Individual endowments, in turn, are an important variable in exlaining the formation of beliefs. Therefore, macroeconomic shocks may influence adult beliefs through both the direct channel and the indirect channel of individual endowment.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~"…in order to control for the endowment effect, researchers introduce individual characteristics at the time of the interview and family background controls. In addition, researchers construct region-specific measures of wealth and educational policies for the ""impressionable years"" period. Finally, when using the panel analysis, researchers are able to control directly for the endowment effect as the NLS72 follows individuals during their formative age, therefore allowing them to control directly for the respondent's level of education, income, and labor market experience."
121~D1, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Region-Specific Wealth~"…in order to control for the endowment effect, researchers construct region-specific measures of wealth for the ""impressionable years"" period."
121~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Region-Specific Education Policies~"…in order to control for the endowment effect, researchers construct region-specific measures of educational policies for the ""impressionable years"" period."
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…when using the panel analysis, researchers are able to control directly for the endowment effect as the NLS72 follows individuals during their formative age, therefore allowing them to control directly for the respondent's level of education, income, and labor market experience.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Average Effect Size~…researchers computed the average effect size (AES) coefficients following Kling, Liebman, Katz, and Sanbomatsu (2004) using the estimated recession coefficient for the outcome variable and the standard deviation of the outcome. The AES is contigent on the total number of outcome variables.
121~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Outcome Recession Coefficient~…the estimated recession coefficient for the outcome variable.
121~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7~DV12~Derived Variable~Outcome Standard Deviation~…the standard deviation of the outcome.
121~D1, D2, D3 ~V26~Variable~Total Number of Outcome Variables~…the total number of outcome variable as used in computing the AES coefficients.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Average Effect Size~…AES estimates have two advantages: whereas results on each single questions could potentially be due to chance (Type I error), this is less likely when several questions are simultaneously summarized in an index. Moreover, the use of indices could also reduce the risk of low statistical power (Type II error).
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Average Effect Size~…three sets of AES estimates are reported: one for preferences for redistribution, one for political behavior, and one for the six variables all together.
121~DV10~L13~Variable Value~Preference AES~…AES estimates are reported for preferences for redistribution combining the three measures on preferences for redistribution.
121~DV10~L14~Variable Value~Political Behavior AES~…AES estimates are reported for political behavior combining the three measures on political behavior.
121~DV10~L15~Variable Value~Preference, Political Behavior AES~…AES estimates are reported for both political behavior and preferences for redistribution by combining all size variables together.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers run three different specifications.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…GSS FIRST SPECIFICATION: the baseline specification includes current region and year-of-interview fixed effects to control for nationwide and region-specific effects, and region-at-16 fixed effects to rule out the possibility of capturing something specific to a region of origin that could drive differences in beliefs. In addition, this specification also controls for basic demographics (gender, race, and age dummies), together with employment and marital status, education, and dummies for family income. This second group of variables controls for those variables that could have been influenced by a recession during the formative years. The specification also includes interactions of region-at-16 dummies with linear age trends.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…GSS SECOND SPECIFICATION: the second specification adds to the baseline specification cohort effects.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…GSS THIRD SPECIFICATION: the third specification is the most demanding specification. It adds to the second specification two additional variables, meant to capture the status of the person when he or she was 16: a nonparametric specification of the family income variable at 16 (with the inclusion of five dummies) and the level of education of the father (given by the number of years of education). These variables are meant to capture individual characteristics, which could be correlated with frequency of regional economic shocks. The specification also controls for the religion of the person at 16 and at time of interivew. Finally, the specification also includes all interactions between region of interview and year effects to take into account all possible region-of-residence and time-varying covariates.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Average Effect Size~…to properly calculate the sample variance of AES, the coefficients are jointly estimated in a seemigly unrelated regression framework. See Clinginsmith, Khwaja, and Kremer (2009) for an alternative application and further details.
121~D1, D2, D3~V17~Variable~Labor Market Status~…employment status is defined using a dummy indicating whether the person is unemployed.
121~D1, D2, D3~V16~Variable~Marital Status~…marital status is controlled for with a dummy indicating whether the person is married.
121~D1, D2, D3~V15~Variable~Education~…education is measured using the number of years of education.
121~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~Income~…researchers control for income in a nonparametric way by including 12 dummies.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in a single cross-section, age, year, and cohort dummies are perfectly collinear and cannot be included all together. In a repeated cross section, few cohorts could not be captured by the age and year dummies. In the model specifications, researchers add as many cohort dummies as possible up to the point that age, time, and cohort dummies are not perfectly collinear.
121~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Family Income~"…the variable on the income of the family when the person was 16 is defined as follows: ""Think about the time when you were 16 years old. Compared with American families in general then, would you say your family income was far below average, below average, average, above average, or far above average?"""
121~V19~L16~Variable Value~Far Below Average~…one of five possible values of family income reported in this GSS.
121~V19~L17~Variable Value~Below Average~…one of five possible values of family income reported in this GSS.
121~V19~L18~Variable Value~Average~…one of five possible values of family income reported in this GSS.
121~V19~L19~Variable Value~Above Average~…one of five possible values of family income reported in this GSS.
121~V19~L20~Variable Value~Far Above Average~…one of five possible values of family income reported in this GSS.
121~D1~V27~Variable~Region-at-Interview Fixed Effects~…all specifications include current region fixed effects to control for nationwide and region-specific effects.
121~D1, D2, D3~V23~Variable~Time Fixed Effects~…all specifications include year-of-interview fixed effects to control for nationwide and region-specific effects.
121~D1~V28~Variable~Region-at-16 Fixed Effects~…all specifications include region-at-16 fixed effects to rule out the possibility of capturing something specific to a certain region of origin that could drive difference in beliefs.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…all specifications include controls for basic demographics, together with employment and marital status, education, and dummies for family income.
121~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…this group of variables controls for those variables that could have been influenced by a recession during the formative years.
121~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Age, Region-at-16~…all specifications include interactions of region-at-16 dummies with linear age trends.
121~D1, D2, D3~V9~Variable~Cohort Fixed Effects~…the second specfication adds to the baseline specification birth cohort effects.
121~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Family Income~…the third specification includes a nonparametric specification of the family income variable at 16 (with the inclusion of five dummies) meant to capture the status of the person when he or she was 16.
121~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Father Education~…the third specification includes the level of education of the father (given by the number of years of education) meant to capture the status of the person when he or she was 16.
121~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Family Income~…this variable is meant to capture individual characteristics, which could be correlated with frequency of regional economic shocks.
121~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Father Education~…this variable is meant to capture individual characteristics, which could be correlated with frequency of regional economic shocks.
121~D1, D2, D3~V21~Variable~Current Religion~…the third specification controls for the religion of the person at the time of interview as religious beliefs could be important in the determination of beliefs about the poor and consequently drive preferences for redistribution.
121~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Family Religion~…the third specification controls for the religion of the person at 16 as religious beliefs could be important in the determination of beliefs about the poor and consequently drive preferences for redistribution.
121~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Region-at-Interview, Year~…the third specification includes interactions between region of interview and year effects to take into account all possible region-of-residence and time-varying covariates.
121~D1, D4~F4~Findings~First GSS Specification and Impressionable Years Recession Coefficient~…in the first model specification, the coefficient on the variable indicating whether the person experienced a recession during his or her impressionable years is significant at least at the 5% level. The significance level increases to 1% for political behavior and ideology and when AES coefficients are used.
121~D1~V3~Variable~Help Poor~…researchers coded the variables so that a positive coefficient means a higher preference for government redistribution.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to assess the magnitude of the results, researchers calculate the beta coefficients.
121~D1, D4~F5~Findings~First GSS Specficiation and Shock Measure~…a one standard deviation increase in the shock measure is associated with an increase of 0.014 standard deviations of the preferences for redistribution variable. The result is about two-thirds of the effect of being unemployed, but much smaller than the effect of race or education.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the initial specification is particularly demanding and has the advantage of precisely identifying the effect of macroeconomic shocks on beliefs while controlling for age, time, and cohort effects, together with a large set of individual controls.
121~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Father Education~…there is also a question on the level of education of the mother, but the number of missing values is much higher than the variable on the level of education of the father.
121~V20, V21~L21~Variable Value~Protestant~…one of five religion dummies included for both religion at time of interview and religion when growing up.
121~V20, V21~L22~Variable Value~Catholic~…one of five religion dummies included for both religion at time of interview and religion when growing up.
121~V20, V21~L23~Variable Value~Christian~…one of five religion dummies included for both religion at time of interview and religion when growing up.
121~V20, V21~L24~Variable Value~Jewish~…one of five religion dummies included for both religion at time of interview and religion when growing up.
121~V20, V21~L25~Variable Value~Other~…one of five religion dummies included for both religion at time of interview and religion when growing up.
121~D1, D2, D3~V21~Variable~Current Religion~…the excluded group is given by nonreligious individuals.
121~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Family Religion~…the excluded group is given by nonreligious individuals.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…beta coefficients are the estimates resulting from an analysis carried out on independent variables that have been standardized so that their variance is 1. They refer to how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change, per standard deviation increase in the predictor variable.
121~D1, D4~F6~Findings~First GSS Specification and Relevancy of Economic Shocks~…in the initial specification, the relevance of economic shocks is four times the effect of being unemployed and comparable to the effect of education.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the third specification reports results, including family background controls, cohort effects, and region-year interactions.
121~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Family Income~…family background at age 16 is relevant in the determination of preferences for redistribution
121~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Father Education~…family background at age 16 is relevant in the determination of preferences for redistribution.
121~D1, D4~F7~Findings~GSS Specifications, Male Dummy, and Work-Luck~…note that the male dummy has a positive effect on the belief that luck is more important than effort. This result is confirmed in the U.S. longitudinal analysis but is not present in the cross-country regressions.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers repeat the first two specifications, restricting the sample to non-movers.
121~D1, D4~F8~Findings~Non-Mover Restriction and Measurement Error~…when regressions are restricted to non-movers, the results are very similar in terms of magnitude when compared to the results from the whole sample, but they are more precisely estimated, showing that measurement error indeed is weakening the results.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers test whether individuals constantly alter their attitudes in response to changing life circumstances by looking at the impact of recessions during other age ranges. Inaddition, researchers also test whether the sensitivey to recessions during the impressionable years declines with age.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in sensitivity specifications, researchers report the results for other age ranges. The baseline specification is repeated based on different eight-year range intervals. This regression reports the coefficents on the variable indicating whether the individual experienced at least one recession at different ages.
121~V30~L26~Variable Value~2 to 9~…one of seven different eight-year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 2 to 9.
121~V30~L27~Variable Value~10 to 17~…one of seven different eight-year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 10 to 17.
121~V30~L28~Variable Value~26 to 33~…one of seven different eight-year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 26 to 33.
121~V30~L29~Variable Value~34 to 41~…one of seven different eight-year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 34 to 41.
121~V30~L30~Variable Value~42 to 49~…one of seven different eight year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 42 to 49.
121~V30~L31~Variable Value~50 to 57~…one of seven different eight-year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 50 to 57.
121~V30~L32~Variable Value~18 to 25~…one of seven different eight-year range intervals used in order to examine the effects of being exposed to a recession between the ages of 18 to 25.
121~D1, D4~F9~Findings~Recessions Across Age and Their Impact on Beliefs~…being exposed to a recession before the age of 17 or after age 25 has little or no impact on beliefs. The formative period between the ages of 18 and 25 is the age during which the majority of beliefs under consideration are formed. The period between 26 and 33 is also relevant for the formation of political beliefs (this is true for each individual variable on political behavior and for the AES estimates), providing some support for the increasing persistence hypothesis theory, at least in the case of political behavior. Recessions experienced during this period also appear to be relevant for the formation of the belief regarding the importance of luck as a determinant of success. The results on the period between the ages 26 and 33, however, disappear in a horse race between this period and the impressionable years.
121~D1, D2, D3~V29~Variable~Non-Mover~…researchers define a non-mover as an individual whose region, state, or country of residence at 16 is the same as the region, state or country of residence at the time of interview. These people are considered as non-movers, but they could have moved between the age of 16 and the time of interview.
121~D1, D2, D3~V30~Variable~Age Dummies~…researchers chose intervals of equal length in order to be consistent with the impressionable years age range.
121~V30~L32~Variable Value~18 to 25~…this age range is considered to be the impressionable years range.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers report an alternative specification for an age period centered around 16 (between 14 and 18). During this period, the probability of moving away for college, for example, should be lower.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…for each age range, researchers also run a specification in which they always include the macroeconomic shock during the impressionable years together with the shock in any of the other age ranges.
121~D1, D4~F10~Findings~Impressionable Years Macroeconomic Shock and 18 to 25 Significance~…when specifications are implemented that always include the macroeconomic shock during the impressionable years together with the shock in any of the other age ranges, the shock experienced between 18 and 25 is always significant in a horse race with the macroeconomic shock experienced in a different period of life.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…given the nature of the dataset, it is difficult to compare the importance of the impressionable years versus other periods of live. The GSS provides information only on the region where an individual lived at 16 - the further removed the time period from that age, the higher the measurement error.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…given the nature of the dataset, it is difficult to compare the importance of the impressionable years versus other periods of live. The GSS provides information only on the region where an individual lived at 16 - the further removed the time period from that age, the higher the measurement error. To limit this problem, researchers also run the regressions for other age ranges by limiting the sample to nonmovers.
121~D1, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Age, Macroeconomic Shocks~…to study the speed at which beliefs diminishes with age, researchers look at the interaction between experiencing a shock during the impressionable years and the age of the person.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to solve the concern that the macroeconomic shock is the only regressor that varies at the regional level during the impressionable years, researchers construct several regional time varying characteristics that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks or that could be driving the formation of preferences for redistribution. Researchers start by including in their regressions two measures of crime. The second set of controls includes a variety of measures on educational policies and quality of education. As a third robustness check , researchers include homeowner. As last time varying controls researchers include two other macroeconomic variables: a measure of wage inequality and the average per capita GDP growth.
121~D4~V31~Variable~Property Crime~…one of two measures of crime included as a regional time varying cahracteristic that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks or that could be driving the formation of preferences for redistribution.
121~D4~V32~Variable~Violent Crime~…one of two measures of crime included as a regional time varying cahracteristic that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks or that could be driving the formation of preferences for redistribution.
121~D4~DV15~Derived Variable~Pupil-Teacher Ratio~…one of three measures of educational policies and quality of education controlling for regional time varying characteristics that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks or that could be driving the formation of preferences for redistribution.
121~D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Average Teacher Salary~…one of three measures of educational policies and quality of education controlling for regional time varying characteristics that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks or that could be driving the formation of preferences for redistribution.
121~D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Per Pupil Expenditures~…one of three measures of educational policies and quality of education controlling for regional time varying characteristics that could be correlated with macroeconomic shocks or that could be driving the formation of preferences for redistribution.
121~D1~V33~Variable~Home Ownership~…as a third robustness check, researchers include home ownership.
121~D1~V33~Variable~Home Ownership~…although this measures is not ideal relative to the aims of the current research, home ownership could partially address the endowment effect being one of the sources of wealth most affected by recessions.
121~D4~DV18~Derived Variable~Wage Inequality~…as one of the last two time varying controls used for robustness checks, researchers include wage inequality.
121~D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Real Regional Per Capita GDP Growth~…as one of the last two time varying controls used for robustness checks, researchers include the real regional per capita GDP growth.
121~D4~DV18~Derived Variable~Wage Inequality~…recessions could be related to changes in inequality; therefore, preferences for redistribution could simply be a reaction to the new level of inequality rather than to the macroeconomic shocks per se.
121~D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Real Regional Per Capita GDP Growth~…researchers include GDP growth to show that large recessions still have an effect on belief formation even when linearly controlling for GDP growth in a given region.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…as a second set of robustness checks, researchers perform two different placebo exercises. The first placebo consists of examining how the identification strategy performs on placebo macroeconomic conditions. The second placebo consts of studying the effect of economic shocks on beliefs that should not be related to regional macroeconomic conditions: differences in macroeconomic experiences during formative age should indeed matter only for economic and political beliefs and not for other types of beliefs.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…PLACEBO 1: the first placebo consists of examining how the identification strategy performs on placebo macroeconomic conditions. The initial placebo is created by imputing a random neighboring region to every individual and verifying that the effect of the macroeconomic shock becomes insignificant.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…PLACEBO 2: the second placebo consists of studying the effect of economic shocks on beliefs that should not be related to regional macroeconomic conditions: differences in macroeconomic experiences during formative age should indeed matter only for economic and political beliefs and not for other types of beliefs. The baseline framework is replicated using a set of beliefs concerning spiritual life or attitudes toward homesexuality (as a proxy for other types of liberal beliefs) as dependent variables.
121~D1~V34~Variable~Image of the World~"…the first alternative belief dependent variable is measured by a question regarding feelings about the image of the world (possible answers, ona scale of 1 to 7, range from ""the world is filled with sin (1)"", to ""there is much goodness, which hints at God's goodness (7)"".)"
121~V34~L33~Variable Value~The World is Filled With Sin~"…the ""image of the world"" value of (1) corresponds with the belief that ""the world is filled with sin""."
121~V34~L34~Variable Value~There is Much Goodness~"…the ""image of the world"" value of (7) corresponds with the belief that ""there is much goodness, which hints at God's goodness""."
121~D1~V35~Variable~Homosexual Sex Relation Beliefs~…the first homosexuality belief question asks the respondents whether homosexual sex relations are always wrong, almost always wrong, sometimes wrong, or not wrong at all.
121~V35~L35~Variable Value~Always Wrong~"…a ""homosexual sex relation beliefs"" value of (1) corresponds with the belief that homosexual sex relations are always wrong."
121~V35~L36~Variable Value~Almost Always Wrong~"…a ""homosexual sex relation beliefs"" value of (2) corresponds with the belief that homosexual sex relations are almost always wrong."
121~V35~L37~Variable Value~Sometimes Wrong~"…a ""homosexual sex relation beliefs"" value of (3) corresponds with the belief that homosexual sex relations are sometimes wrong."
121~V35~L38~Variable Value~Not Wrong at All~"…a ""homosexual sex relation beliefs"" value of (4) corresponds with the belief that homosexual sex relations are not wrong at all."
121~D1~V36~Variable~Homosexual Speaking Beliefs~…this homosexuality belief question asks respondents whether they believe that homosexuals should be allowed to speak (the answers are assigned a value of 1 for yes and zero for no).
121~D1~V37~Variable~Homosexual Teaching Beliefs~…this homosexuality belief question asks respondents whether they believe that homosexuals should be allowed to teach (the answers are assigned a value of 1 for yes and zero for no).
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the estimation process uses cross-sectional differences in regional economic conditions to estimate the impact of recessions on beliefs. By including cohort, age, and year-of-interview fixed effects, together with a large set of individuals and family controls, the specifications have the advantage of isolating the impact of recessions on preferences for redistribution and political behavior.
121~D1, D4~F11~Findings~Crime, Educational Quality, Wage Inequality, Home Ownership and Beliefs~…an increase in the level of crime moves people to the right in terms of political ideology (it also has an opposite effect on preferences for redistribution, but the results are not robust across specifications and different variables). A low level of educational quality as measured by pupil-teacher ratio and teacher salaries (although less robust) increases the desire for redistribution. A higher level of wage inequality during the impressionable years is positively correlated with a higher desire for redistribution and a left-wing ideology. An increase in home ownership reduces the desire for redistribution, but the results are not robuts across different variables. The effects is also not significant in the NLS72, where it is more precisely estimated.
121~D1~V33~Variable~Home Ownership~…home ownership in the region where one grew up does not affect political ideology.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~"…to provide an aggregate perspective on the importance of macroeconomic shocks on preferences for redistribution and political behavior, researchers construct a counterfactual exercies - what would have happened to the distribution of political behavior across the nine U.S. regions if people had not experienced a recessions during the impressionable years. To do this, researchers first construct fitted values for the variable ""voting for the Democratic Party"". Next, a counterfactual series is constructed for political behavior without heterogeneous effects of recessions (by falsely assuming a coefficient equal to zero for the recessions variable). Summing up across individuals within each region at each time of interview allows for the comparison of the evolution of political behavior with and without the effect of experiencing a recession during the impressionable years."
121~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Fitted-Counterfactual Ratio~…for each region, the ratio of fitted regional political behavior to the counterfactual regional political behavior, obtained by setting the economic shock coefficient to zero, is plotted
121~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Fitted-Counterfactual Ratio~…the fitted-counterfactual ratio has been multiplied by 100 to be expressed as a percentage. Deviations from a value of 100 are attributable to the heterogeneous effects for the population of that region in one specific interview year of living through a recession when young.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…since the model controls for year of interview, age, and cohort fixed effects, together with region of residence at 16, region-of-interview fixed effects, and individual controls, the diffference between the fitted and counterfactual series can identify only the heterogeneous effects of having different individuals with different macroeconomic experiences during the impressionable years in each region.
121~D1, D4~F12~Findings~Impressionable Years Recession and Voting Democrat~…having people who experienced a recession when young affected the probability of voting for the Democratic Party in a sizeable matter in each region of the United States. The effect, which could be as large as 15%, was more pronounced during the 1970s and 1980s. This is not surprising, as people living in these regions during this period were young during the Great Depression. The effect on preferences for redistribution explains, on average, between 3% and 10% of the effect, depending on the variable. The effect on political ideology and party affiliation is closer to the effect of voting for the Democratic Party.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…cross-country analysis relies on data from the World Value Survey (WVS), a compilation of national, individual-level surveys on a wide variety of topics, including preferences for redistribution and political behavior. 
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…this survey contains information on standard demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, education, labor, market status, and income.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…the WVS has been carried out five times (1981 to 1984, 1990 to 1993, 1995 to 1997, 1999 to 2004, and 2005 to 2007). The coverage varies depending on the wave, from 22 countries in 1980 to 81 countries in the fourth wave. The fifth wave was carred out in 57 countries.

121~D3~T6~Time Period~1999-2004~…the fourth wave of the World Value Survey.
121~D3~T7~Time Period~2005-2007~…the fifth wave of the World Value Survey.
121~D3~T8~Time Period~1981-1984~…this WVS wave covers 22 countries.
121~D3~T9~Time Period~1999-2004~…this WVS wave covers 81 countries.
121~D3~T10~Time Period~2005-2007~…this WVS wave covers 57 countries.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…the WVS contains a richer set of questions on preferences for redistribution or preferences for government intervention in the economy in general. In particular, researchers run regressions on six different questions regarding government responsibility, income inequality, private-state ownership, society: egalitarian-competitive,  society: welfare-low taxes, and work-luck.
121~D3~V38~Variable~Government Responsibility~"…the relevant WVS question asks respondents, ""How would you place your views on this scale? 1 means you agree completely with the statement on the left; 10 means you agree completely with the statement on the right; and if your views fall somewhere in between, you can choose any number in between. People who take more responsibility for themselves (1) vs. The government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for (10)?"""
121~D3~V39~Variable~Income Equality~"…the relevant WVS question asks the respondent to rate his or her views on a scale from 1 to 10 on the following statement: ""Income should be made more equal"" (1) versus ""We need larger income differences as incentives"" (10)."
121~D3~V40~Variable~Private-State Ownership~"…the relevant WVS question asks the respondent to place his/her views on a scale from 1 to 10 on the following statement: ""Private ownership of business should be increased"" (1), versus Government ownership of business should be increased"" (10)."
121~D3~V41~Variable~Society: Egalitarian-Competitive~"…the relevant WVS questions asks the respondent, ""And now, could you please tell me which type of society you think this country should aim to be in the future. For each pair of statements, would you prefer being closer to the first or to the second alternative? First statment: An egalitarian society where the gap between rich and poor is small, regardless of achievement. Second statement: A competitive society, where wealth is distributed according to one's achievement."""
121~V41~L39~Variable Value~S:EC First~"…a ""society: egalitarian-competitive"" value of (1) corresponds with an inclination toward the first statement."
121~V41~L40~Variable Value~S:EC Somewhat Closer to First~"…a ""society: egalitarian-competitive"" value of (2) corresponds with a slight inclination toward the first statement."
121~V41~L41~Variable Value~S:EC Can't Say~"…a ""society: egalitarian-competitive"" value of (3) corresponds with no preference toward either statement."
121~V41~L42~Variable Value~S:EC Somewhat Closer to Second~"…a ""society: egalitarian-competitive"" value of (4) corresponds with a slight inclination toward the second statement."
121~V41~L43~Variable Value~S:EC Second~"…a ""society: egalitarian-competitive"" value of (5) corresponds with no preference toward the second statement."
121~D3~V42~Variable~Society: Welfare-Low Taxes~"…this question asks the respondent to identify a preference between two statements, on a scale of 1 to 5. The first stament is ""A society with extensive social welfare, but high taxes."" Second statement: ""A society where taxes are low and individuals take responsibility for themselves."""
121~V42~L44~Variable Value~S:W-LT First~"…a ""society: welfare-low taxes"" value of (1) corresponds with an inclination toward the first statement."

121~V42~L47~Variable Value~S:W-LT Somewhat Closer to Second~"…a ""society: welfare-low taxes"" value of (4) corresponds with a slight inclination toward the second statement."
121~V42~L48~Variable Value~S:W-LT Second~"…a ""society: welfare-low taxes"" value of (5) corresponds with no preference toward the second statement."
121~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Work-Luck~"…the relevant WVS question asks the respondent to choose on a scale from 1 to 10 between the following statements: ""In the long run, hard work usually brings a better life"" (1), ""Hard work does not generally bring success - it is more a matter of luck and connections"" (10)."
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…the WVS also has two questions on political ideology and party affiliation.
121~D1, D3~V6~Variable~Political Ideology~"…the relevant WVS question asks the respondent, ""In political matters, people tak of 'the lef' and 'the right.' How would you place your views on this scale, generally speaking?"" The answers could range from ""Left"" (1) to ""Right"" (10)."
121~D1, D3~V7~Variable~Party Affiliation~"…the relevant WVS question asks the respondent, ""If there was a national election tomorrow, for which party on this list would you vote?"" Each country in the survey has a country-specific list of political parties. Researchers assign to each party a number summarizing their political ideology. Parties are coded on a sacle from 1 to 10 (with 10 indicating a more left-wing ideology) using data from Huber et al. (1995)."
121~D5~D5~Dataset~Huber et al. (1995)~…country-specific political parties are coded on a scale from 1 to 10 (with 10 indicating a more left-wing ideology) using data from Huber et al. (1995).
121~D3~V38~Variable~Government Responsibility~…researchers code all the WVS beliefs and politics questions such that a higher number is associated with a more government intervention and more left-wing attitudes.

121~D1, D3~V7~Variable~Party Affiliation~…researchers code all the WVS beliefs and politics questions such that a higher number is associated with a more government intervention and more left-wing attitudes.
121~D3, D6~V43~Variable~Macroeconomic Disaster~…in the case of the cross-country analysis, researchers rely on the definition of economic shocks by Barro et al. (2008), who construct a measure of crises for a large set of countires starting from and improving Angus Maddison's dataset. They define trough-peak disaster periods as contractions in GDP growth of at least 10%.
121~D6~D6~Dataset~Barro et al. (2008)~…in the case of the cross-country analysis, researchers rely on the definition of economic shocks by Barro et al. (2008), who construct a measure of crises for a large set of countires starting from and improving Angus Maddison's dataset. The dataset includes time-series data on GDP from 1870 to today for a sample of 39 countries and estimates periods of economic disasters.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…the WVS does not contain questions on voting behavior in the most recent elections.
121~D3, D6~V43~Variable~Macroeconomic Disaster~…for each country, a time interval of the economic disaster is provided.
121~D6~D6~Dataset~Barro et al. (2008)~…in this data, for the OECD countries, most of the macroeconomic disasters took place before 1950 (with the exception of Finland), whereas non-OECD countries experienced macroeconomic disasters before and after 1950.
121~D3, D6~V43~Variable~Macroeconomic Disaster~…the cross-country macroeconomic shock variable is a dummy equal to 1 if the person experienced a macroeconomic disasters (following Barro's definition) during his or her impressionable years.

121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…unfortunately, the WVS does not contain any information on family background (such as family income when young or parental level of education) or race. Therefore, none of these controls are able to be included in the analysis
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the basic cross-country specification includes a dependent variable indicating the response to one of the beliefs or politics questions of an individual interviewed at time t in country c. Explanatory variables include a dummy indicating whether the individual experienced a recession during the impresssionable years in his or her country, individual characteristics, age, country, and wave fixed effects; whereas country*age includes country-specific age trends. Researchers drop immigrants from the analysis.

121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…for the cross-country analysis, three different specifications are presented.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~...WVS FIRST SPECIFICATION: in the baseline specifications, similar to the GSS specification, researchers control for age, gender, marital and labor market status, income, education, religion, and country and wave fixed effects.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…WVS SECOND SPECIFICATION: in the second specification, the first specifcation is reported with the addition of cohort dummies.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…WVS THIRD SPECIFICATION: in the second specification, the second specification is reported with the addition of country-year interactions.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…Malaysia and Sri-Lanka are not present in the WVS.
121~D6~D6~Dataset~Barro et al. (2008)~…Malaysia and Sri-Lanka are covered by Barro et al. (2008).
121~V45~L55~Variable Value~United States~…in the United States, periods of economic disasters are 1906-1908, 1913-1914, 1918-1921, 1929-1933, and 1944-1947.
121~V45~L56~Variable Value~Argentina~…in Argentina, periods of economic disasters are 1887-1891, 1895-1898, 1899-1900, 1901-1902, 1906-1907, 1912-1917, 1928-1932, 1958-1959, 1980-1982, 1987-1990, and 1998-2002.
121~D3, D6~F13~Findings~WVS Analysis and Impressionable Years Recession~…in the cross-country analysis, the coefficient on the variable indicating whether the person experienced a recession during her impressionable years is always significant at least at the 10% level in all specifications, including the two specifications with a smaller set of countries.
121~D3, D6~F14~Findings~WVS Analysis and AES Coefficient Estimates~…in the cross-country analysis, the AES estimates confirm the general finding found for each single variable and the significance level also increases to 1%. Consistent with the literature and with the findings for the United States, educated, married, male, and high-income-earning individuals are less favorable to redistribution. Being unemployed increases the desire for government intervntion in the economy.
121~D1, D4~F15~Findings~Macroeconomic Shock and Preferences for Redistribution~…a one-standard-deviation increase in the shock measure is associated with an increase of 0.01 standard devations in preferences for redistribution (0.03 when focusing on the society aimed at by individuals.
121~D2, D7~F16~Findings~Impressionable Years Recession, Unemployment, and Preferences for Redistribution~…the impact of having experienced an economic shock when young is roughly equivalent to the effect of being unemployed when looking at the work-luck belief, 67% when looking at the income inequality belief, but about 31% in the government responsibility regressions. The effect is between 12% and 20% of the effect of having a middle level of education and between 9% and 89% of the impact of an upper level of education.
121~D3~F17~Findings~WVS Specifications, Male Dummy, and Work-Luck~…being male in the cross-country data is negatively associated with the importance of luck as a driver of economic success. This result is different than what was found for the United States in the GSS, where there is a positive association between being male and the importance of luck as a driver of success (the result is also confirmed in the United States in the longitudinal analysis).
121~D3, D5, D6~F18~Findings~Impressionable Years Macroeconomic Disaster, Political Ideology, and Political Affiliation.~…a positive association is found between experiencing a macroeconomic disaster when young and both left-wing ideology and affiliation with a left-wing political party. The effect is significant at the 1% level for party affiliation and at the 10% level for political ideology. The AES estimates are significant at the 1% level.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers also run regessions with the WVS data for other age ranges.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…similarly, with the analysis for the GSS, researchers also test the robustness of their results to the inclusion of other time-varying country characteristics during the impressionable years.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers run a placebo assigning to each individual the macroeconomic shock of another country, and one showing that beliefs not related to the economy are not affected by economic shocks.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…the richer set of questions in the WVS allows an analysis of various beliefs.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the cross-country results are reported without and with the inclusion of the economic shock during the impressionable years, respectively.
121~D6~V47~Variable~Average Per Capita GDP Growth~…for another country control, researchers include the average per capita GDP growth, as in the GSS.
121~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…for another country control, researchers include the average per capita GDP growth, as in the GSS. Researchers also include a measure of democratization, as summarized by the polity2 index, a variable proxying for the level of democracy in a country and going from -10 (autocracy) to 10 (democracy). As a belief unrelated to macroeconomic conditions, researchers use a 0 to 1 question, asking the respondent whether he or she believes in heaven.
121~D3, D5~V48~Variable~Polity2 Index~…researchers also include a measure of democratization, as summarized by the polity2 index, a variable proxying for the level of democracy in a country and going from -10 to 10.
121~V48~L57~Variable Value~Autocracy~…a polity2 index of -10 indicates a country with a completely autocratic government.
121~V48~L58~Variable Value~Democratic~…a polity2 index of 10 indicates a country with a completely democratic government.
121~D3~D3~Dataset~World Value Survey~…variables on educational policies, wage inequality, and crime are not available on a yearly basis for the countries and period of analysis
121~D3~V49~Variable~Belief in Heaven~…as a belief unrelated to macroeconomic conditions, researchers use a 0-1 question, asking the respondent whether he or she believes in heaven.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…the third dataset is the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS72). This dataset provides a nationally representative sample of the high school population for the class fo 1972. Since the sample contains only one birth cohort, with most students being born in 1954 or 1955, there is no need to correct for potential cohort or life-cycle effects.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…the survey provides a broad spectrum of information on socioeconomic status, home background, educational attaiment, work status, religion, marriage, and the family. For the purposes of the current research, the survey also contains data on the belief about the relative importance of work versus luck as a driver of success at the time of original interview and in subsequent years.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…data was collected during six years: 1972, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1986. Data collected in the base year (1972) contains information on students' personal and family background. Follow-ups, conducted in 1973, 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1986, offer information on work, family, educational experience, and opinions since high school. The panel dimension of the survey is exploited from 1973 to 1986 and merged with sutdent's personal and family background obtained from the base year.
121~D2~T11~Time Period~1972.0~…the base year of the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972.
121~D2~T12~Time Period~1973-1986~…the follow-up years of the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…despite the limitation of not having the cohort variation, this dataset has the advanatge of following respondents over time, including information on locations at the state level. The restricted geocode version of the survey is used to know an individual's location in each survey year. This allows the association to each individual the unemployment rate of his or her state of residence at each point in time.
121~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Work-Luck~…the key dependent variable in NLS72 analysis is a question asking the respondent whether he or she thinks that luck is more important than hard work as a determinant of economic success.
121~V5~L59~Variable Value~Stronly Disagree~…one of four responses to an NLS72 question asking the respondent whether he or she thinks that luck is more important than hard work as a determinant of economic success.
121~V5~L60~Variable Value~Disagree~…one of four responses to an NLS72 question asking the respondent whether he or she thinks that luck is more important than hard work as a determinant of economic success.
121~V5~L61~Variable Value~Agree~…one of four responses to an NLS72 question asking the respondent whether he or she thinks that luck is more important than hard work as a determinant of economic success.
121~V5~L62~Variable Value~Strongly Agree~…one of four responses to an NLS72 question asking the respondent whether he or she thinks that luck is more important than hard work as a determinant of economic success.
121~D7~V50~Variable~Unemployment Rate~…as an indicator of local economic conditions in the NLS72 analysis, researchers use the unemployment rate of an individual resided in each survey year.
121~D7~V50~Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the data on state unemployment come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
121~D7~D7~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics~…the data on state unemployment come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There is substantial variation in the state unemployment rates from 1972 to 1986, the period in which people were interviewed, making this a useful measure for the purposes.
121~D2~T2~Time Period~1972-1986~…there is substantial variation in the state unemployment rates from 1972 to 1986, the period in which people were interviewed in the NLS72.
121~D2, D7~V51~Variable~State-Level Recession~…NLS72 analysis uses another measure of recession based on the state GDP for comparison with the other parts of the paper.
121~D2, D7~M2~Methodology~Linear-Log~…in state-level analysis using the NLS72, specifications include two sets of controls: the first set is time-invariant and includes labor market and marital status (a dummy for being unemployed and a dummy for being married, respectively), a dummy for when the individual completed college and the log of real personal income. Researchers also include a set of personal characteristics that do not vary over time (the information was collected in 1972): a dummy if the person is African American, a dummy for being male, a variable indicating the level of education of the father (a dummy if the father didn't complete high school), the religion in which the person was raised and the real log of family income.
121~D1, D2, D3~V17~Variable~Labor Market Status~…a dummy for being unemployed.
121~D1, D2, D3~V16~Variable~Marital Status~…a dummy for being married.
121~D2~V2~Variable~College Graduation Year~…a dummy for when the individual completed college.
121~D2~V44~Variable~Real Personal Income~…the log of real personal income as included in linear-log regressions on state-level data.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…the survey also collected information on grades during high school, whether the person was in an academic track, and whether he or she was working part time during high school.
121~D1, D2, D3~V13~Variable~African American~…a dummy if the person is African American.
121~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Male~…a dummy for being male.
121~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Father Education~…a variable indicating the level of education of the father (a dummy if the father didn't complete high school in the context of the NLS72).
121~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Family Religion~…the religion in which the person was raised.
121~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Family Income~…the real log of family income as included in cross-state analysis.
121~D2, D7~M2~Methodology~Linear-Log~…in cross-state analysis using the NLS72 data, researchers analyze the formation of beliefs as a function of current economic conditions.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…individuals are interviewed during the impressionable years and when they are 32.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…sample attrition in the survey is not systematic. One potential problem could be that more entrepreneurial subjects are more likely to leave their state of residence during a recession. This could increase the probability that they will drop out from the sample. Researchers do not believe this type of attrition is a concern, since the number of movers is similar to people with similar characteristics in datasets such as the Current Population Survey.
121~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Family Religion~…in state-level analysis, researchers include five dummies for religious denomination in which a respondent was raised. The excluded group is given by nonreligious individuals.
121~V20, V21~L21~Variable Value~Protestant~…one of five dummies for religious denomination included in state-level analysis.
121~V20, V21~L52~Variable Value~Roman Catholic~…one of five dummies for religious denomination included in state-level analysis.
121~V20~L60~Variable Value~Other Christian~…one of five dummies for religious denomination included in state-level analysis.
121~V20, V21~L24~Variable Value~Jewish~…one of five dummies for religious denomination included in state-level analysis.
121~V20, V21~L25~Variable Value~Other~…one of five dummies for religious denomination included in state-level analysis.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…the panel structure allows researchers to look at the interaction effects between the unemployment rate during the impressionable years and personal experiences during that period, since the exact location of the individual is known at each point in time.
121~D2, D7~M2~Methodology~Linear-Log~…for an individual living in state s and interviewed at time t, an equation is estimated where the dependent variable is the beliefs or political ideology of the respondent and where the researchers split the effect of the state employment rate into two parts: that between 1972 and 1979, and that if the survey year is 1986. Time-varying and time-invariant demographic and economic controls are included as well. All regressions include state and year fixed effects. The error terms are clustered by state. 
121~V50~L63~Variable Value~Impressionable Years Unemployment Rates~…the state unemployment rate times a dummy equal to 1 if the survey year is between 1972 and 1979 (in those years, the individual is between 18 and 25) and zero otherwise.
121~V50~L64~Variable Value~1986 Unemployment Rates~…the state unemployment rate times a dummy equal to 1 if the survey year is 1986 (when the respondents are 32) and zero otherwise.
121~D2~V52~Variable~State Fixed Effects~…all state-level regressions include state fixed effects.
121~D1, D2, D3~V23~Variable~Time Fixed Effects~…all state-level regressions include time fixed effects.
121~D2, D7~M2~Methodology~Linear-Log~…one problem with the state-level empirical approach followed using the panel structure is that researchers are looking at the contemporaneous effect of local economic conditions on beliefs; therefore, the issue of reverse causality is more relevant than when the analysis is done retrospectively, as in the GSS or the WVS.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…another way of using the NLS72 would be to look at the cross-section of individuals interviewed in 1986 and assign to each of them the average local unemployment rate fo the states where they lived. This strategy would be exactly equal to what was done with the GSS data, but looking at only one cohort.
121~D2, D7~F19~Findings~1986 Cross Section Average State-Level Unemployment Rate Coefficients~…in a regression on the cross-section of individuals interviewed in the 1986 follow-up to the NLS72, the average unemployment rate of the states where individuals lived during the impressionable years has a coefficient of 0.012 and is significant at the 10% level, whereas the coefficient of the state unemployment rate in 1986 is -0.002 and is not statistically significant.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…there are only 3,311 respondents that have no missing observations for the whole survey period.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…as was done with the General Social Survey, researchers split the sample between people who moved between states during the impressionable years and people who did not. Roughly 30% of the sample moved to a different state at least once between 18 and 25. The average is slightly higher than in the GSS. This is partly due to the fact that the NLS72 uses states and not regions as geographical units; therefore, people moving between states but within the same region are considered movers in the NLS72 but stayers in the GSS. Also the sample of the NLS72 is selected in the sense that includes people who finished high school who are typically more mobile than people who drop out of high school.
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…the NLS72 is an important complement to the current study because individuals can be observed during their impressionable years and then eight years later. In addition, a wealth of information exists on personal background and personal experiences during the impressionable years. However, in the NLS72, analysis is restricted to one specific cohort.
121~D1~D1~Dataset~General Social Survey~…there is more measurement error in the GSS than the NLS72 since individuals cannot be followed over time; in the GSS, the shock is identified at the regional level, not at the state level; the recession of 1979 could have had particularly strong effects on young adults.
121~D2, D7~M2~Methodology~Linear-Log~…in order to test for the possibility that the effect of a recession on beliefs could depend on initial conditions during early adulthood, an interaction term between recessions during the impressionable years and different initial characteristics or different experiences during the impressionable years is included in the specification.f
121~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972~…this data is the most appropriate in testing the possibility of heterogeneous effects because one can observe individuals at each point in time during the impressionable years.
121~V50~L63~Variable Value~Impressionable Years Unemployment Rates, Time-Invariant Controls~…researchers interact the state unemployment rate during the impressionable years with time-invariant controls.
121~V50~L63~Variable Value~Impressionable Years Unemployment Rates, Time-varying Controls~…researchers interact the state unemployment rate during the impressionable years with time-varying controls.
121~D3~F20~Findings~Heterogeneous Effects~…the interaction effect with education is always negative but significant (at the 1% level) 50% of the time (for party affiliation and three of the measures on preferences for redistribution). Similar results are found when researchers interact their measure of macroeconomic shock with income: the interaction is always negative but significant for two of the measures for preferences for redistribution and for party affiliation. There are not heterogeneous effects by gender.

122~D1, D3~V6~Variable~Gender~…to analyze differences in job stability between genders.
122~D1, D3~V5~Variable~Age~…when x refers to age, it is increased by t years in each subsequent survey to follow the right age cohort over time.

122~D1, D3~V2~Variable~t-year Retention Rate~…variance is higher than it would be with longitudinal data when looking ata subsample with particular chracteristics x.
122~D1, D3~V2~Variable~t-year Retention Rate~…when estimating over time, an additional factor to consider is the poetential for dependence in sampling errors because the same supplement is used in the numerator of one retention rate and the denominator of the earlier retention rate.
122~D1, D3~V2~Variable ~t-year Retention Rate~…conditioned on the number in the denominator of each rate (i.e. the number of individuals with characteristics x and tenure c in the base year of calculating the retention rate).

122~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data for 1983, 1987 and 1991 drawn from the January Current Population Survey tenure supplements.
122~D3~D3~Dataset~February Contingent Work Supplement~…a supplement of the 1995 Current Population Survey.
122~D1~V3~Variable~Current Tenure~…for 1983, 1987 and 1991, the proportion reporting tenure of 1-2 years is lower than the proportion reporting tenure of 2-3 years due to the Current Population Survey Tenure Supplement's lack of category for those with over 1 year of tenure and less than 2 years of tenure; those with >1 and <2 are more likely to pick 2 rather than 1 as those with 1 year or less of tenure are queried to answer the amount of months that they have had tenure.
122~D3~V3~Variable~Current Tenure~…for 1995, values could be expressed in terms of weeks, months or years.
122~D1~V3~Variable~Current Tenure~…spikes at multitudes of 5 years occur in 1983, 1987 and 1991 suggesting rounding with regard to the number of years for which a respondent has worked for the present employer.
122~D3~V3~Variable~Current Tenure~…in 1995, the Census Bureau did not specify how long each target individual had been working continuously for their present employer.
122~D3~D3~Dataset~February Contingent Work Supplement~…tenure questions take different forms for individuals classified as contingent workers in an attempt to clear up some ambiguities that might arise in using the general tenure questions from earlier years for contingent workers.
122~D3~D3~Dataset~February Contingent Work Supplement~…first asks how long the contingent worker has been accepting assignments from a temporary help agency, and secondly asks how long the contingent worker had tenure at their currently assigned job as well as the company that contracts their services.

122~V7~L1~Variable Value~Contingent Worker~…employed by a contract agency and through a company at which they are contracted.
122~V7~L2~Variable Value~Fully Employed~…directly employable by a company without contingency.
122~V7~L3~Variable Value~Contingent Worker~…has a minor overall effect on the estimate because these workers represent only about 10% of the workforce depending on how the measurement of tenure is affected.
122~D1, D3~V3~Variable~Current Tenure~…low and high values of tenure are defined in the 1995 survey based on the workplace specific and more general tenure responses.
122~D3~D3~Dataset~February Contingent Work Supplement~…earlier tenure supplements refer to continuous employment whereas this survey does not.
122~D4~D4~Dataset~Displaced Worker, Job Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplement~…a supplement of the 1996 Current Population Survey.
122~D4~D4~Dataset~Displaced Worker, Job Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplement~…to correct for upward bias in Febrary Contingent Work Supplement data by specifying for continuous tenure and total tenure.
122~D4~D4~Dataset~Displaced Worker, Job Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplement~…asks how long the respondent has been working continuously for their present employer.
122~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Adjusted Tenure~…calculate fraction of individuals whose total tenure exceeds continuous tenure, then calculate the amount of the difference for this subset of individuals, then apply these adjustment factors to 1995 reported tenure to approximate the distribution of continuous tenure.
122~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Adjusted Tenure~…first estimate the proportion of whom the two measures differ, then calculate the difference between total and continuous tenure at four quartiles of the distribution of this difference, then divide into randomly chosen groups corresponding with the 1995 CPS, divide this chosen group into four equally sized groups, and then  adjust tenure by the estimated ratio for one of the quartiles.
122~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Adjusted Tenure~…moves some individuals from higher tenure to lower tenure resulting in lower retention rates through 1995 than is obtained in the absence of this adjustment.
122~D5~D5~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…a source of adjustment factors that double check the robustness of the prior adjusted tenure results applied to the 1995 CPS data.
122~D5~D5~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…a longitudinal study covering 1988-1992 that asks workers to report current tenure in two ways: total time with the employer, and total time since most recent hire.
122~D4~D4~Dataset~Displaced Worker, Job Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplement~…total tenure question of 1996 CPS is not asked of the self-employed, so this group is not included in the adjustment since the distinction between total and continuous tenure is not applicable to it.
122~D4~D4~Dataset~Displaced Worker, Job Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplement~…as a substitute for the 1995 supplement as a means of overcoming asimilarities between the survey questions and resulting data.
122~D4~D4~Dataset~Displaced Worker, Job Tenure, and Occupational Mobility Supplement~…although the 1996 sample does not come from a stable population with a stable survival function for job tenure and a constant arrival rate, violations of such assumptions over a short period of time may be sufficiently minor, allowing for the use of the 1996 CPS data as a supplement source for measuring job tenure in 1995.
122~D1, D3~V1~Variable~Job Stability~…enhanced comparability of such over time by extending the analysis to use the 1995 data and to determine whether there are alternative data sources that are not incomparable by changes in the survey instrument.
122~D5~D5~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…to analyze changes in job stability on a consistent basis over time.
122~D5~D5~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…smaller sample size than CPS data preventing much disaggregrated analysis.

126~D1, D4, D5, D6~F17~Findings~State Appropriations and Enrollment Rates~…in states where state appropriations per college-age person faltered in the 1980s, the ensuing rise in tuition level caused a reduction in enrollment rates, which translated into a continuing rise in the college wage premium in the 1990s, while in states with sustained state appropriations per college-age person in the 1980s, there was relatively little rise.
126~D3, D4, D6~F18~Findings~Elasticity of Enrollment Rates With Respect to Tuition~…an estimated elasticity of enrollment rates respect to tuition levels of -0.13 suggests that if the relatively modest 42% tuition increases of the 1980s had been averted, the public enrollment rate would have reached 18.5% in 1990 instead of 2000 which is a 5.5 percentage point increase.
126~D3, D6~F19~Findings~Hypothetical Enrollment Rate Changes w/o Baby Bust~…with no baby bust, the 1980s increase of 24 percentage points in enrollment rates would have been reduced to 17 percentage points yielding an enrollment rate of 18.3% in 1990.
126~D1, D3, D6~F20~Findings~Elasticity of Relative Supplies with Respect to Enrollment Rates~…with an elasticity of relative supplies with respect to enrollment rates of 0.6, the 5.5-percentage-point increase in public enrollment rates would have resulted in a 3.3-percentage-point increase in relative supplies and, using an elasticity of the college premium with respect to relative supplies of -0.2, this would have yielded a 0.7-percentage point decrease in the college premium.

129~D3~D3~Dataset~NYFed~…an additional group of respondents were recruited through a snowball smaple, through referrals of friends and acquaintances, however only a smaller subset of newer American Life Panel members, i.e. those who participated in the Michigan Survey after December 2006, was selected.
129~D2~D2~Dataset~RAND~…2,057 American Life Panel members completed the survey reporting an average age of 50.0, a median age of 51, 57% female, 65% married or living with partner, 45% had at least a bachelor's degree, 78% owned a home, 90% were white and 22% lived in one of the five bubble/bust sttes.

130~130: Household Mobility over the Great Recession: Evidence from the United States 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances Panel~~~~
130~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…this paper uses data from the 2007 to 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel to examine United States households' decisions to move and the role of negative home equity and economic shocks, such as job loss, in these decisions.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…this data is used to examine household's decisions to move and, in particular, the importance of negative equity and economic shocks in these decisions.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…conducted as cross-sections every three years and provide the most comprehensive and highest quality microdata available on United States household wealth.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…combines a geographically stratified random sample and a list sample that oversamples households that are likely to be relatively wealthy.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…the analysis in this paper uses nonresponse-adjusted survey weights, which account for this data source's sample design, so that the estimates are representative of United States households.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…the 2007 component of the 2007 to 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel was conducted as part of the seuence of triennial cross-sectional Survey of Consumer Finances surveys. After the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances was largely completed, the Federal Reserve Board designed and implemented the 2009 follow-up survey to provide a fuller picture of the effects of the intervening recession on households' finances than was available from aggregate data. The 2009 survey's structure largely mirrored that of the 2007 survey so that it is possible to construct parallel estimates of wealth and its component for each household in both years.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…the 2009 survey collected a variety of data on changes in households' situations between 2007 and 2009, including whether the household had moved. For households that owned a home in 2007 and had moved by 2009, this information includes whether the household retained ownership of their 2007 residence and, if so, whether the property was still the household's primary residence. Based on these questions, researchers classify families that owned their home in 2007 as having moved if, in 2009, the family either no longer owned the 2007 home or if they still owned the 2007 home but were living in a new residence.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~"…the information on households' moves in the 2007 to 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel includes data on aspects of mobility that are often not available in other data sources: first, the data indicate the reason for the move, so researchers can distinguish involuntary moves due to eviction or foreclosure from moves for other reasons such as a desire to be closer to relatives; second the data distinguishes moves, loosely speaking, within a local labor market from moves to a new labor market, specifically asking whether the family moved to a different metropolitan area (if the family resided in an metropolitan statistical area in 2007) or county than the one where the family lived in 2007. The question asked if the family had moved to a different city but the interviewer was instructed to record ""no"" for moves to a city in the same metropolitan area; for households that did not reside in a metropolitan area, the interviewer was instructed to record ""no"" for moves within the same county."
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…the choice to collect panel data came after the 2007 survey had largely concluded, so the survey did not take other steps to facilitate re-contacting respondents as a part of the 2007 interview. Given this, one potential concern is that results from the 2007 to 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances may be biased if families that moved between 2007 and 2009 were more difficult to locate; however, fewer than 3% of 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances participants could not be located.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…one concern with this data source is that results may be biased if household which moved were less likely to be re-interviewed after being located. For example, settling in after a move may impose additional demands on a family's time and, consequently, a household that moved recently may be less likely to participated in the 2009 survey; however, although almost 90% of the eligible 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances households were re-interviewed, geographic mobility was one of the few statistically significant correlates of non-response.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…if the 2007 respondent was alive and living in the United States, the target household in 2009 was the one that contained that person; otherwise, if the 2007 respondent had a spouse or partner who was a part of the primary economic unit as defined in the 2007 survey and who lived permanently in the United States, the target household in 2009 was the one that contained the 2007 spouse or partner of the 2007 respondent. If neither of these criteria were met, the case was considered out of scope.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…homeowners' assessment of their home values and mortgage balances in this data source align reasonably well with external estimates.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…few homeowners reported having negative equity in 2007.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…comprehensive data on household finances in this data source is used to construct four criteria for defining a family as potentially economically insecure.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…5% of Survey of Consumer Finances homes are note in a Loan Performance Core Based Statistical Area, which comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas and micropolitan areas.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…questions in this data source about credit applications and outcomes provide a useful indicator of households that are more likely to be credit constrained.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…the median number of months between the 2007 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel interviews is 26 months.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…this data source indicates a longer-term downward trend in mobility rates apparent in the cross-sectional Survey of Consumer Finances surveys conducted since 1989, but it does not appear to explain the relatively steep drop in mobility over the 2007 to 2009 period.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…inference is based on standard errors that account of imputation uncertainty, sample design, and the correlation between estimates for households in the 2007 to 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…families that moved between 2007 and 2009 reported a variety of resons for moving that included both voluntary and involuntary considerations.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…respondents to this survey could report several reasons for moving.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…in the 2007 interview, 1.3% of the Survey of Consumer Finances homeowners reported that their primary home was worth less than the total amount of their outstanding home-secured debt. This fraction rised to 1.9% if families that reported mortgage debt equal to the value of the home are included.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…this panel data allows the comparison of self-reported house price declines to the values predicted by LP price indexes. 
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~...SCF homeowners from 2007 who moved and sold their house between surveys were asked for the sales price.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…data source the reports the subjective probability of moving within the next two years.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…less than 7% of all families were 2007 homeowners that moved and only half of these, or about 3.4% of all families moved locally.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…this data indicates that, on the whole, household mobility fell at the onset of the Great Recession.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…this paper takes advantage of the Survey of Consumer Finances panel's extensive information on household's balance sheets and employment experiences to examine in depth the role of adverse economic shocks and negative hom equity in households' mobility decisions.
130~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…the estimation sample for logistic regressions includes Survey of Consumer Finances homeowners other than mobile-home owners and homeowners that operate a farm or ranch business on the property.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…estimates from the United States Current Population Survey indicate that between 11% and 13% of householders moved in each year between 2004 and 2012 and that 35% of families moved between 2005 and 2010.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source indicates that mobility rates in the United States have trended down since the 1980s.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to provide context for the three reasons given in the Survey of Consumer Finances, researchers compare them to the reasons cited by houehold heads in the Current Population Survey that moved between 2007 and 2009; the relative frequencies of several of the reasons for moving are often similar to those in the Survey of Consumer Finances.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source did not directly identify moves due to foreclosure and eviction in the 2007, 2008, or 2009 surveys, but only if nearly all moves due to an other housing reason or other reasons were due to involuntary reasons would the share be comparable to that in the Survey of Consumer Finances. The lack of an explicit foreclosure/eviction response option in the 2007 to 2009 surveys likely lowered the prevalence of this response in the Current Population Survey.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the mobility reasons code frame in this data source is limited relative to the Survey of Consumer Finances as the Current Population Survey fram includes only foreclosure/eviction but the Survey of Consumer Finances allows reaearchers to include serval other reasons for forced moves.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…respondents to this survey could report only the primary reason for moving.
130~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the comparable Current Population Survey question for determining a respondent's reason for moving is ""what was your main reasons for moving?""; the data frame for the question is found in the Current Population Survey 2012 Annual Social and Economic Technical Documentation Supplement."
130~D3~D3~Dataset~RealtyTrac~…data source used to draw information on foreclosure filing trends.
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…this measure of homeowner's equity position uses the self-reported data in the Survey of Consumer Finances on the home's current value and on the balance of all outstanding home-secured debt (including first- and junior lien mortgages, home-equity loans, and home-equity lines of credit) in 2007
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…this measure of home equity may be more accurate than an estimate based on aggregate data or price indexes to the extent it incorporates property- and borrower-specific information.
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…a family's decision to move or default depnds directly on its perception of its house value and equity position.
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…the self-reported feature of this measure might lead to greater measurement error than other estimates of these amounts because the value that a family places on their home may differ from the market value to the extent that the price of the home (as for many types of assets) may not be unique. External literature has concluded that, on the whole, homeowners' assessment of their home values and mortgage balances in the Survey of Consumer Finances align reasonably well with external estimates. The current researchers have found that self-reported data and house price indexes provide similar estimates of the shares of the shares of homewoners that are underwater.
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…one drawback of this measure is that it gauges homeowners' equity position in 2007. Few homeonwers reported having negative equity in 2007, and consequently the estimated relationship between negative equity and mobility may be imprecisely estimated. In addition, some families may have chosen to move between 2007 and 2009 due to events that occurred after the 2007 interview, such as a sharp decline in housing equity or another negative event; in such a case, the self-reported 2007 equity value would not provide an accurate basis for assessing the correlation between mobility and negative equity.
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…if adverse shocks such as loss of a job are positively correlated with house price declines, these may also lead to a positive correlation between negative equity and mobility.
130~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure I~…in isolation, negative equity does not significantly affect the likelihood of a long-distance move.
130~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Net Worth~…the net worth of an individual respondent and his or her family as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Net Worth~…researchers perform a transformation of net worth equal to sign(net worth)*ln(abs(net worth /1000)+1).
130~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Subjective Probability of Moving~"…researchers control for the subjective probability of moving within the next two years in logistic regressions on ""Moved""."
130~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Subjective Probability of Moving~…the subjective likelihood of staying in the same home accounts for the fact that some moves may have been anticipated rather than the result of adverse economic shocks or declines in home equity.
130~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Age Squared~…the age of the head of the household squared as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Income Squared~…the family income of the household squared as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~House Value~…the value of a Survey of Consumer Finances household's house in 2007; included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~House Value~…house price is modified by the CBSA-level LP house price index or state-level LP house price index (for those not in a CBSA.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…this measure of homeowner's equity position focuses on computing an accurate measure of negative equity, namely predicted negative equity as of September 2008 (approximately the midpoint of the two interviews.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…researchers predict home equity for families that owned their home in 2007 and did not move by 2009 based on Loan Performance house price indexes and the self-reported value of the home in 2007 and 2009, if the family did not move; the estimate of home equity in 2008 further assumes that household made the scheduled payments on these loans.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…in this measure, researchers predict home equity by adjusting the value of the home based on a combination of survey responses and external home price indices; for families that owned a home in 2007 and retained that home (even if they moved), the fraction of the self-reported home value change that occured by September 2008 is found. That is, researchers find the percent decline in the self-reported value of the house and scale it by the fraction of the change in the  home price index that occured by September 2008. For families that sold their 2007 home, the reported sale price is used.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…if adverse shocks such as loss of a job are positively correlated with house price declines, these may also lead to a positive correlation between negative equity and mobility.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…because house prices continued to decline after the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances interviews were completed, researchers use CBSA- and state-specific house price indexex to estimate whether homeowners had negative home equity in September 2008.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…in isolation, negative equity does not significantly affect the likelihood of a long-distance move.
130~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Homeowner's Equity Measure II~…negative equity is estimated based on percent of 2007 to 2009 home value change that occurred as of September 2008 in LoanPerformance home price index.
130~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Payment-to-Income Ratio~…one of three measures capturing a families' financial position in 2007, specifying for whether the family had a payment-to-income ratio greater than 40%.
130~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Ex-Post Security~…measures a family's ex post employment security, which is measured based on whether the family head or spouse reported having lost a job in the 12 months prior to the 2009 interview.
130~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Ex-Post Security~…in the primary analysis, researchers identify families in which the respondent or spouse/partner (if applicable) reportedly was unemployed and looking for work at any time during the past 12 months prior to the 2009 interview. This measure would not reflect unemployment spells that started and ended between the 2007 and early 2008. To account for such spells, households are treated as having experienced a negative employment shock not only if their income in 2008 was reportedly low due to labor market earnings.
130~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Ex-Post Security~…in isolation, unemployment does not significantly affect the likelihood of a long-distance move.
130~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Ex-Post Security~…the share of homeowner families in which the household head or spouse/partner was unemployed at the time of the interview.
130~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Financial Security~…researchers combine the the three financial position variables, i.e. the payment-to-income ratio, late debt payments, and credit refusal benchmarks, and subsequently refer to a family that meets any one of these as financially insecure.
130~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Financial Security~…in isolation, financial security does not significantly affect the likelihood of a long-distance move.
130~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Economic Security~…each of the four measures of economic insecurity, i.e. the payment-to-income ratio, late debt payments, credit refusal benchmarks, and the ex-post security measure, can lead to the types of liquidity, income, or credit constraints that may contribute to default under the double-trigger hypothesis.
130~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Predicted 2009 Mobility Rate~…this measure is calculated by estimating a linear trend in mobility rates based on the seven Survey of Consumer Finances between 1989 and 2007 and then predicting the mobility rate in 2009 if this trend had continued.
130~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Family Groups~…to distill the differences in mobility more directly, researchers construct three mutually exclusive groups.
130~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Family Groups~…the three included family group categories are separated into three dummy categories in an logistic regression in order to estimate difference in mobility across the four groups; each of the coefficients on these family group variables is directly interpretable as the difference in mobility relative to non-vulnerable homeowners that were not underwater.
130~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Homeowner Characteristics~…this vector captures differences in the characteristics of homeowners including family income, net worth, 2007 house value, marital status, the presence of children, age of the household head, race/ethnicity, number of years in the home, whether the home is within an MSA and whether the home is in a recourse state.
130~D1~F1~Findings~Underwater and Probability of Moving~…the probability of having moved for a family that was underwater and that met either of the economic-insecurity criteria was roughly 22 percentage points greater than the rate for families that did not have negative equity and that were not classified as economically insecure.
130~D1~F10~Findings~Foreclosure and Eviction Mobility Rate Differences~…when the the definition of reasons for moving is restricted to include only foreclosure or eviction, the difference falls to 3.7 percentage points.
130~D1~F11~Findings~Long Distance vs. Local Reasons for Moving~…the roughly 40% of movers that moved long distance cited job changes or a wanting to live nearer to familiy as reasons for moving, whereas families that moved locally rarely cited these reasons.
130~D1~F12~Findings~Involuntary Reasons for Moving for Homeowners vs. Renters~…nearly 20% of homeowners that moved cited one of three involuntary, housing-related reasons for moving, compared with about 6% of renters that moved; these involuntary reasons include foreclosure, short sale, or eviction.
130~D1~F13~Findings~Homeowners vs. Renters and Marital Status Changes~…homeowners that moved were twice as likely as renters that moved to cite changes in marital or partnership status as the reason for moving over the period.
130~D1~F14~Findings~Desire to Own a Home~…a far greater fraction of renters than homeowners pointed to the desire to own a home.
130~D1~F15~Findings~Economic Security and Financial Security for Homeowners~…nearly 25% of homeowners met at least one of the financial insecurity criteria, and for 16% of families that owned their home, the head of family or spouse had an unemployment spell between surveys. More than one-third of homeowner families were classified as economically insecure on one or both dimensions.
130~D1~F16~Findings~Mobility Rate Differences for Insecure Households~…mobility rates were 4 to 6 percentage points greater than average for homeowners that were either financially insecure at the start of the recession or that experienced an unemployment spell in 2008 or 2009.
130~D1, D3~F17~Findings~Underwater Households and Mobility~…based on the reported sales price in the Survey of Consumer Finances and a deflated 2007 mortgage balance, about 16% of Survey of Consumer Finances homeowners who moved and sold in between surveys were expected to be underwater, nearly the same as the 16.5% underwater rate predicted for movers by LP. 
130~D1, D3~F18~Findings~House Price Changes~…among movers in the Survey of Consumer Finances, the median (mean) LP house price change as of September 2008 is a 10% (12%) decline, and among the Survey of Consumer Finances respondents who sold their house, the median (mean) house price change is an 8% (9%) decline.
130~D1, D3~F19~Findings~Economic Security, Equity, and Mobility~…economically insecure families that had zero or positive home equity were about 2 percentage points more likely to move; homeowners with negative equity that were not economically insecure were also about 2 percentage points more likely to move. It should be noted that neither of these differences are statistically significant.
130~D1, D2~F2~Findings~One- and Five-Year Mobility Rate Differences for the SCF and the CPS~…data from the 2004, 2007 and 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances yield greater estimates of one- and five-year mobility rates than the Current Population Survey estimates of 15% to 16% and 41%, respectively.
130~D1, D3~F20~Findings~Equity and Security~…when considering unemployment and financial insecurity separately, homeowners with negative equity that were not insecure were about 9 percentage points more likely to move relative to families that did not have negative equity and that were not classified as economically insecure.
130~D1, D3~F21~Findings~Economic Security, Equity, and Probability of Moving~…depending on the measure of economic insecurity, the probabilities of moving due to foreclosure, short sale or a similar reason were between 17 and 36 percentage points greater for economically insecure homeowners with negative equity, a difference that is remarkable given that only 1.9% of homeowners moved for involuntary reasons. In contrast, neither unemployment nor any measure of economic insecurity was predictive of moves for other, volunatary reasons.
130~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Probability of Moving and Unemployment~…estimates from logistic regressions suggest that the odds of moving were about 62% greater when a family had only an unemployment spell than when the family had neither an unemployment spell nor negative equity.
130~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Probability of Same MSA/County Move and Unemployment~…the probability of moving within the same metropolitan statistical area or county between 2007 and 2009 was more than 3 percentage points greater for families that experienced an unemployment spell but had positive home equity.
130~D1, D2, D3~F24~Findings~Probability of Same MSA/County Move, Unemployment and Equity~…the probability of moving within the same metropolitan statistical area or county between 2007 and 2009 was 27 percentage points greater for families with both an unemployment spell  and negative equity.
130~D1, D2~F25~Findings~Local Moves and Unemployment in 2009~…families that owned a home in 2007 and moved locally were more than twice as likely to have a head or spouse/partner that was unemployed in 2009 than those that moved long distance (4.6% compared with 9.6%), whereas the unemployment rates for these groups were nearly identical in 2007 (1.6% compared with 1.8%).
130~D1, D2~F26~Findings~Head of Household Unemployment and Distance~…considering all families in this panel data, 4.3% of households had a head or spouse/partner that was unemployed in 2007, and in 2009 this fraction was 7.7%. If homeowners that moved locally had the same unemployment rate in 2009 as homeowners that moved long-distance, the fraction of all households with a head or spouse/partner that was unemployed would have been only 0.1 percentage points lower, 7.6%.
130~V11~L1~Variable Value~Voluntary~…around 30% of moves were prompted, at least in part, by wanting to live either in a different location or in a new or different space - reasons that would appear to be largely voluntary.
130~V11~L10~Variable Value~Wanted New/Different Space~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L11~Variable Value~Costs/Rent Too High~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L12~Variable Value~Job Changes~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L13~Variable Value~Wanted Better/Different Locations~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L14~Variable Value~Foreclosed/Evicted/Other Involuntary~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L15~Variable Value~To Be Near Relatives~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L16~Variable Value~Want to Own Home~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L17~Variable Value~Health~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L18~Variable Value~Divorce/Separation~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L19~Variable Value~Moved In w/ Spouse/Partner~…one of the options that Survey of Consumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L2~Variable Value~Involuntary~…less than 30% of moves were due to principally involuntary reasons such as foreclosure eviction, or short sale or, similarly, to high housing costs.
130~V12~L2~Variable Value~Involuntary~…involuntary reasons for moving include foreclosure, short sale, or eviction.
130~V11~L20~Variable Value~Shorter Commute~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L21~Variable Value~Retired~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L22~Variable Value~Other Housing Reasons~…one of the options that Survey of Consumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V11~L23~Variable Value~Rented Now Own~…one of the options that Survey of Cosnumer Finances respondents who moved can indicate as their reason for moving.
130~V17~L24~Variable Value~Married~…a binary variable indicating that an individual respondent's marital status is married.
130~V19~L25~Variable Value~White, non-Hispanic~…a binary variable indicating that an individual respondent's race/ethnicity is white, non-Hispanic.
130~D1, D2~V28~Variable~College Degree~…a binary variable indicating that an individual respondent has earned a college degree.
130~V11~L3~Variable Value~Job Changes~…around 13% of movers cited job changes as the reason for moving, a reason that likely comprises both involuntary and voluntary changes in employment.
130~V12~L4~Variable Value~Long Distance~…long distance movers were relatively more likely to have moved to have a shorter commute time.
130~V12~L4~Variable Value~Long Distance~…long distance moves are those in which the family moved to a new metropolitan area (if applicable) or county.
130~V12~L5~Variable Value~Local~…local movers more commonly reported wanting to become homeowners or a desire for a different space.
130~V12~L5~Variable Value~Local~…families that moved due to foreclosure, eviction, or similar reasons were more likely to move locally and remain in the same local labor market area rather than to move outside the 2007 Metropolitan Statistical Area or county.
130~V12~L5~Variable Value~Local~…local moves refer to moves within the same metropolitan statistical area (if applicable) or county.
130~DV8~L6~Variable Value~Economically Insecure and Non-negative Equity~…families that have non-negative equity but were economically insecure (either through an unemployment shock or through financial insecurity.
130~DV8~L7~Variable Value~Economically Secure and Negative Equity~…families with negative equity but that were not economically insecure.
130~DV8~L8~Variable Value~Economically Insecure and Negative Equity~…families that were both economically insecure and had negative equity.
130~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Economically Secure and Non-negative Equity~…families with positive home equity that were not insecure are the omitted group to limite collinearity.
130~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the analysis in this paper uses nonresponse-adjusted survey weights, which account for the Survey of Consumer Finances panel data's sample design, so that the estimates are representative of United States households.
130~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to gauge whether the decline in mobility observed in the Survey of Consumer Finances panel simply reflects the longer term decline in mobility rates since 1989, researchers estimate a linear trend in mobility rates based on the seven Survey of Consumer Finances between 1989 and 2007 and predict the mobility rate in 2009 if this trend had continued.
130~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Logistic~…reseaerchers model a logistic regression with moved as the outcome and separate family groups, demographics, and the unemployment rate as explanatory variables in order to estimate differences in mobility across the four groups.
130~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Logistic~…each coefficient on the family group variables in this equation is directly interpretable as the difference in mobility relative to non-vulnerable homeowners that were not underwater; therefore, it is not necessary to sum the coefficients to estimate the difference in mobility for families that both have negative home equity and are financially-vulnerable families, as would be the case for conventional dummies and interaction terms. On the other hand, one cannot immediately determine the statistical significants of the interaction term, i.e. the additional the effect of both having predicted negative equity and being economically insecure over and above either of the criteria alone.
130~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Logistic~…later specifications of this model distinguish betweeen local and long-distance mvoes and suggest that economic shocks tend to increase the probability of local moves, particularly for homeowners that were estimated to be underwater.
130~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Logistic~…significance levels are for differences in mobility rates for homeonwers with and without the characteristic and are based on 999 bootstrap replicate samples and incorporate both sampling and imputation uncertainty.
130~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Logistic~…the dependent variable in logistics regressions, moved, is equal to 100 if the family moved and 0 otherwise.
130~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Logistic~…regressions of this form include controls for income and income squared net worth, children present, age of head and age squared, years in home, subjective probability of moving in 2007 interview, value of home in 2007, level and change in county unemployment rate, and metropolitan status.
130~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Logistic~…estimates are weighted with non-response adjusted sampling weights.
130~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Logistic~…the estimation sample includes Survey of Consumer Finances homeowners other than mobile-home owners and homeowners that operate a farm or ranch business on the property.
130~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~2007-2009~…time period from which Survey of Consumer Finances panel data is drawn.
130~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~2007-2009~…survey period from which Current Population Survey data was drawn. During this period, the Current Population Survey did not directly identify moves due to foreclosure and eviction, which likely lowered the prevalence of this response to the survey.
130~D1~T2~Time Period~2006-2012~…time period during which the United States experienced extraordinary house price decreases.
130~D1~T3~Time Period~1989-2007~…the longer-term scope of the Survey of Consumer Finances data for which a linear trend in mobility rates is estimated in order to predict the mobility rate in 2009 if this trend had continued.
130~D3~T4~Time Period~2009-2011~…time period through which foreclosure rates experienced declines.
130~D2~T5~Time Period~2012.0~…the data frame for the Current Population Survey question determining the main reasoning for moving is found in this survey year of the source.
130~D1~V1~Variable~Owners' Mobility~…resaearchers classify families that owned their home in 2007 as having moved if, in 2009, the family either no longer owned the 2007 home or if they still owned the 2007 home but were living in a new residence (either owned or rented).
130~D1~V1~Variable~Owners' Mobility~…this narrower definition of household moves has the advantage of being substantially comparable to mobility rates that can be constructed for the Survey of Consumer Finances cross-sections.
130~D1~V1~Variable~Owners' Mobility~…the measure of two-year mobility rates may not be strictly comparable because the underlying questions differ; nevertheless researchers believe that the differences in the questions likely accounts for little of the difference in the 2007 and 2009 estimates.
130~D1~V1~Variable~Owners' Mobility~…if adverse shocks such as loss of a job are positively correlated with house price declines, these may also lead to a positive correlation between negative equity and mobility.
130~D1, D2~V10~Variable~Number of Chidren~…one reason renters may be more mobile is due to the fact that homeowners and renters are typically at different points in the life cycle; families that own their home tend to be more likely to be couples with children present in the home.
130~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Reason for Moving~…families that moved between 2007 and 2009 reported a variety of resons for moving that included both voluntary and involuntary considerations.
130~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Reason for Moving~…families that moved could report more than one reason, but most gave only one. 
130~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Reason for Moving~…a homeowner may decide to move and retain ownership of the house for use as a rental property.
130~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Reason for Moving~…up to nine reasons for moving are used in estimating the correlation between reason and mobility; in turn, the totals may sum to more than 100%.
130~D1~V12~Variable~Distance~…to determine variation within the reasons for moving across short- and long-distance movers.
130~D1~V12~Variable~Distance~…researchers include distance in two separate logistics regression in order to determine the distance-based moving trends due to economic shocks.
130~D1~V13~Variable~Credit Refusal~…included among families denied credit are those who responded that they did not apply for credit because they believed they would be turned down.
130~D1, D2~V13~Variable~Unemployment Spells~…this variable captures households in which the head or spouse/partner had been unemployed at any time in the year prior to the 2009 interview.
130~D1~V14~Variable~Moved~…a binary variable indicating whether an individual respondent and his or her family moved.
130~D1~V14~Variable~Moved~…an indicator variable specifying for an individual that moved and left their prior residence from 2007 to 2009.
130~D1~V14~Variable~Moved~…the dependent variable in logistics regressions is equal to 100 if the family moved and 0 otherwise.
130~D1~V15~Variable~Family Income~…the family income for a Survey of Consumer Finances household from all sources in 2006; included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1, D2~V17~Variable~Marital Status~…an indicator variable specifying for marital status included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1, D2~V10~Variable~Number of Chidren~…the presence of children in the household as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Race/Ethnicity~…the race/ethnicity of the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances respondent as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1~V2~Variable~Renters' Mobility~…researchers classify families that rented in 2007 but did not rent the same property in 2009 as having moved.
130~D1~V2~Variable~Renters' Mobility~…the measure of two-year mobility rates may not be strictly comparable because the underlying questions differ; nevertheless researchers believe that the differences in the questions likely accounts for little of the difference in the 2007 and 2009 estimates.
130~D1~V2~Variable~Renters' Mobility~…if adverse shocks such as loss of a job are positively correlated with house price declines, these may also lead to a positive correlation between negative equity and mobility.
130~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Time in Home~…the number of years a family has lived in their current home as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Metropolitan Status~…a binary variable indicating whether the home of an individual respondent of the Survey of Consumer Finances is located within a metropolitan statistical area.
130~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Recourse State~…a binary variable indicating whether the home of an individual respondent of the Survey of Consumer Finances is located within a recourse state.
130~D1, D2~V22~Variable~County Level Unemployment Rate~"…researchers control for the county level unemployment in logistic regressions on ""Moved""."
130~D1, D2~V22~Variable~County Level Unemployment Rate~…this unemployment rate is controlled for since some families may have moved in anticipation of a potential layoff, which the measure based on realized unemployment spells may not capture.
130~D1~V23~Variable~Northeast~…a region dummy variable for the household location in 2007.
130~D1~V24~Variable~North Central~…a region dummy variable for the household location in 2007.
130~D1~V25~Variable~South~…a region dummy variable for the household location in 2007.
130~D1~V26~Variable~West~…a region dummy variable for the household location in 2007.
130~D1~V27~Variable~Percent Underwater~…the percent of Suvey of Consumer Finances housheholds that went underwater is further based on 2007 self-reported mortgage balance, deflated by expected mortgage balance paid by September 2008.
130~D1~V3~Variable~Late Debt Payments~…one of three measures capturing a families' financial position in 2007, specifying for whether the family was late on debt payments by two months or more in the prior year.
130~D1~V4~Variable~Credit Refusal~…one of three measures capturing a families' financial position in 2007, specifying for whether the family had been turned down for credit in the preceding five years.
130~D1, D3~V5~Variable~LP-CBSA Price Index~…the home price index used in this paper is the Loan Performance Core Based Statistical Area-level house price index. For the 5% of Survey of Consumer Finances homes that are note in an CBSA, researchers use the state-level LP home price index. CBSAs comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas and micropolitan areas.
130~D1, D3~V5~Variable~LP-CBSA Price Index~…the Tier 11 LP HPI used in this analysis includes mortgages of all types and the LP repeat-transactions include only sales transactions.
130~D1, D3~V5~Variable~LP-CBSA Price Index~…sharp house price declines lead homeowners to default and, consequently, to move from the home, especially if the likelihood of recovery in house prices appears slim.
130~D1, D3~V5~Variable~LP-CBSA Price Index~…because house prices continued to decline after the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances interviews were completed, researchers use CBSA- and state specific-house price indexes to estimate whether homeowners had negative home equity in September 2008.
130~D1, D3~V6~Variable~Transaction Costs~…one reason renters may be more mobile is differences in transaction costs, which are generally thought to be higher for homeowners, including the costs of selling the prior residence and of financing a new home.
130~D1, D3~V6~Variable~Transaction Costs~…higher transaction costs might be expected to lead not only to greater mobility for renters but also to a greater share of moves for largely voluntary reasons for renters compared with homeowners.
130~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Head of Household Age~…one reason renters may be more mobile is due to the fact that homeowners and renters are typically at different points in the life cycle; families that own their home typically have older heads than that of renters.
130~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Head of Household Age~…the age of the household head as included in a homeowner characteristics vector.
130~D1~V8~Variable~Wealth~…one reason renters may be more mobile is due to the fact that homeowners and renters are typically at different points in the life cycle; families that own their home tend to have greater wealth.
130~D1~V9~Variable~Income~…one reason renters may be more mobile is due to the fact that homeowners and renters are typically at different points in the life cycle; families that own their home tend to have greater income.
130~D1, D2~F27~Findings~Mobility Rate Differences for the SCF and the CPS~…there exists a sizable 8.5 percentage point difference in mobility rates between the two surveys (10.2% in the Survey of Consumer Finances panel compared with 1.7% in the 2012 Current Population Survey).
130~D1~F3~Findings~Total Mobility Rate and Average Distance~…about 22% of households moved between the 2007 and 2009 interviews, and roughly half of moves over this period were local.
130~D1~F4~Findings~Renter vs. Homeowner Mobility Rate~…nearly half of renters moved between 2007 and 2009, a rate roughly five times that for homeowners.
130~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Homeowner Characteristics and Mobility Rate Differences~…accounting for observable differences betten renters and owners, i.e. transaction costs, household head age, wealth and income, and number of children present in the home, narrows the estimated gap in mobility by about half to roughly 20 percentage points.
130~D1~F6~Findings~Total Mobility Rate Including Only Those That Moved w/o Retaining Ownership~…the overall estimated 2007 to 2009 mobility rate is 2.3 percentage points lower if one considers only moves in which the household did not retain ownership of the 2007 residence; moreover, roughly one-third of 2007 homeowners that moved between 2007 and 2009 did not sell the 2007 home.
130~D1~F7~Findings~Overall Mobility Over the Relative Period~…the fraction of families that moved between Survey of Consumer Finances interviews was 8 percentage points lower than the fraction of families that reported in 2007 that they had purchased or moved into the home in the prior 26 months, the median number of months between the 2007 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel interviews.
130~D1~F8~Findings~Actual Mobility Rates vs. Predicted Rates and Recessionary Trends~…the actual mobility rates, as captured in the 2007 to 2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel, are significantly lower than the predicted rates, a finding that suggests that the recent recession measurably reduced homeowner mobility. For example, if the estimated historical trend based on the 1989 to 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances had continued through 2009, the 26-month mobility rate would have been 7 percentage points greater than the boserved rate of 19.9%. This difference is significant at a 1% level. The estimates of the change in one- and three-year mobility rates are significant at one- and five-percent levels, respectively.
130~D1~F9~Findings~Share of Mobility for Involuntary Reasons~"…the share of families that reported having moved due to foreclosure/eviction increased from 0.9% in 2011, when this reason was coded from write-in responses, to 1.7% in 2012, while the share citing ""other housing reasons"" increased between 2011 and 2012."

132~D3~F3~Findings~Non-Cuban Hispanic Wage Decline~…non-Cuban Hispanics experienced a non statistically significant 20% decline in wages, a change concentrated among more educated Hispanics suggesting non relation to the Mariel boatlift which had a majority impact on low paying manufacturing jobs.
132~D1~V4~Variable~Industry~…to simplify the Annual Survey of Manufacturers disaggregrated dataset by examining only four aggregates.
132~V4~L3~Variable Value~Apparel~…Miami's single largest manufacturing industry, and as it is a major low skill employer that tends to expand with the availability of less-skilled labor.
132~V4~L4~Variable Value~Group 1~…a group of industries, excluding apparel, that responded positively to the local availability of high school dropouts in United States metropolitan areas during the 1980s.

132~D1~V5~Variable~Output~…output or value added is measured as the total value of shipments minus materials and energy costs, avoiding the doulbe counting of intermediate goods produced in the manufacturing secotr.
132~D2, D3, D4~V6~Variable~City~…108 cities available to be matched, yet only 11 were chosen to be included in some regressions as they were the top 10 percent of matches to the simple average of four trend differences from Miama during the 1970s.
132~D1~V4~Variable~Industry~…where each sector is an approximately equal-sized employer of pre-Mariel Cubans.
132~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~Apparel Sector Pre and Post Mariel Boatlift~…there is about a 1 for 1 systematic negative linear relationship between Miami's pre-1980 difference in trend from each of the 108 metropolitan areas and the estimated relative trend break after 1980 when focusing on the Apparel sector.

132~D3~V7~Variable~Age~…the analysis in this research is limited to those Cubans aged 26 to 64 in 1990, i.e. those who could have been of working age when they arrived in the United States.
132~D1, D2, D3~F5~Findings~Cuban Employment~…by 1990, almost all industries took on additional Cuban employment, with a majority of industries more than doubling their Cuban employment share, a finding that is in accordance with the fact that the Mariel boatlift appears to have tripled the Cuban workforce on this base.
132~D4~V8~Variable~Computer Use~…examination of Miami's use of the canonical skill-biased technology, computers, in order to support external researcher's belief that an exogeneous demand shock for skill driven by the introduction of new skill-complementary technologies was responsible for the rise in the relative employment of skilled workers during the 1980s.
132~D4~D4~Dataset~October Current Population Survey~…from 1984, which asked respondents about their occupational computer use.
132~D4~T3~Time Period~1984.0~…survey year of the October Current Population Survey from which computer-use data is drawn. 
132~D4~D4~Dataset~October Current Population Survey~…comparison cities here include nine of the eleven metropolitan areas from the first set of comparison cities, with the exclusion of Richmond and Nashville, and with the addition of four cities used in the Card (1990) paper with the former set being matched on prior trends in manufacturing mix and the latter on prior trends in labor market outcomes.
132~D4~F6~Findings~Computer Use in Miami vs. Comparison Cities~…23% of workers used computers in Miami in 1984, several percentage points below each set of comparison cities.
132~D4~D4~Dataset~October Current Population Survey~…limited in that it does not contain information on immigrant status.
132~D4, D2~F7~Findings~Computer Use w/ Hispanics Dropped~…dropping all Hispanics from the regression reduces Miami's computer-use gap with the first set of cities, but not with the Card (1990) cities, which include two major Hispanic-immigrant destinations, Houston and Los Angeles.
132~D2~D2~Dataset~Censuses of Population~…as a source of pre-boatlift computer use, which is proxied with the share of workers in a respondent's metropolitan area in 1980 employed in computer and peripheral technical support occupations.
132~D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Age-Education-Gender~…a very general function of age and education, fully interacted with gender, is controlled to account for differing skill mix in Miami from the comparison cities across all races.
132~D4~F8~Findings~Fraction of Workers in Computer and Peripheral Technical Support Occupations in 1980~…the fraction of workers in computer and peripheral technical support occupations in 1980 was 0.53 in Miami, 0.49 in the nine comparison cities, and 0.57 in the Card (1990) comparison cities with a standard error on the difference between Miami and each set of comparison cities of 0.04%.
132~D1, D4~F9~Findings~Computer Use Share w/ Occupational Controls~…when detailed occupation controls are added to the regression, it is clear that although Miami has a higher share of its work force employed in the occupations that tend to use computers than the comparison cities, once this is controlled for, the share of workers actually using a computer within a given occupation is lower.
132~D2, D3, D4~V9~Variable~Comparison Cities~…multiple city groups of comparison with Miami in order to analyze impacts of the Mariel boatlift in comparison with nationwide trends.

133~133: How do E-Verify Mandates Affect Unauthorized Immigrant Workers~~~~
133~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…a variable determining whether a state has implemented mandates that require employers to check that the workers they hire can be legally employed in the United States.
133~D1~T1~Time Period~2006-2012~…time period in which 19 states passed laws or had executive orders that required employers to verify worker's employment eligibility, in some states only applying to some or all parts of the public sector or to business with government contracts with eight states enacting universal mandates applying to all employers.
133~V1~L1~Variable Value~Partial Mandate~…state mandate policies applying only to some or all parts of the public sector or to businesses with government contracts.
133~V1~L2~Variable Value~Universal Mandate~…eight states where the mandates are universal, applying to all employers regardless of government interaction.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…in some states, the mandates phase in by employer size, applying first to employers with more than a certain number of workers and eventually applying to smaller employers.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…the main goal of which is to deter the hiring of unauthorized immigrants, however for some supporters there exist additional implicit goals such as to discourage unauthorized immigrants from reamining in or moving to states that adopt the mandates, and to improved labor market opportunities for United States natives and legal immigrants who may compete with unauthorized immigrants for jobs.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…the state mandates of interest are those that use E-verify, a free online system created and managed by the federal government in which employers enter the information on the employment eligibility form that the 1986 IRCA requires new hires to complete, and E-Verify compares that information with Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to look for discrepencies.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…in order to study how these mandates affect labor market outcomes among immigrants who are likely to be unauthorized.
133~V1~L2~Variable Value~Universal Mandate~…this research paper focuses specifically on universal mandates since relatively few unauthorized immigrants are likely to work for government agencies and there is no way to distinguish between those who work for a government contractor and those who do not.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…the primary effect of these mandates should be to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants who are employed in a state via reductions in both labor demand and labor supply.
133~D1~V2~Variable~Wages~…impacts for unauthorized immigrant workers with the presence of E-Verify Mandates are unclearas these mandates result in lower labor demand for unauthorized workers and in turn should push wages up, however a reduction in labor supply due to unauthorized workers leaving the labor force to avoid states with these mandates should push wages up.
133~D1~V3~Variable~Unemployment~…effects on such as a result of E-Verify Mandate are examined in this research paper as labor outcomes not examined in previous research.
133~D1~V4~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…effects on such as a result of E-Verify Mandate are examined in this research paper as labor outcomes not examined in previous research.
133~D1~V5~Variable~Turnover~…effects on such as a result of E-Verify Mandate are examined in this research paper as labor outcomes not examined in previous research.
133~D1~V3~Variable~Unemployment~…may be affected by E-Verify mandates by causing workers to enter or exit the labor market in response to changes in not only their own labor market opportunities but also changes in their family members' labor market opportunities.
133~D1~V4~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…may be affected by E-Verify mandates by causing workers to enter or exit the labor market in response to changes in not only their own labor market opportunities but also changes in their family members' labor market opportunities.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…employers are not required to verify the employment eligibility of current employees suggesting that these mandates may trap unauthorized immigrants into their current jobs, reducing their job mobility and bargaining power for wages, while increasing job mobility among competing authorized workers by enabling them to move into better jobs.
133~D1~V5~Variable~Turnover~…defined as employer-to-employer transitions among workers.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from 2002 to 2012 used to examine the effect of state-level E-Verify mandates.
133~D1~T2~Time Period~2002-2012~…survey period of interest from which Current Population Survey data is drawn.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a large-scale survey conducted monthly  by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the primary source of labor force statistics in the United States.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…housing units are surveyed for four consecutive months, out of the sample for eight months, and then back in the sample for four more consecutive months where every month, the labor force status of noninstitutionalized civilians aged 16 and older is identified.
133~D1~V3~Variable~Unemployment~…identified among people aged 20 to 64 Current Population Survey response indicating the labor force status of noninstitutionalized civilians aged 16 and older.
133~D1~V4~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…identified among people aged 20 to 64 Current Population Survey response indicating the labor force status of noninstitutionalized civilians aged 16 and older.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…contains some information about job mobility through responses about whether an individual respondent in subsequent months after the first survey is asked whether they still work for the same employer.
133~D1~V6~Variable~Job Mobility~…where or not an individual respondent has switched employers or not during the survey period.
133~D1~V6~Variable~Job Mobility~…requires knowing people's employer last month, responses are only available for survey waves 2-4 and 6-8 for people who remain in the Current Population Survey (i.e. those who do not move).
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…because job mobility in this dataset requires knowing people's employer last month, responses are only available for survey waves 2-4 and 6-8 for people who remain in the Current Population Survey (i.e. those who do not move) therefore all employment analysis is limited to those survey waves.
133~D1~V5~Variable~Turnover~…the researcher's analysis of employer-to-employer transitions is further limited to people who were employed in both the previous and current month of survey.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…asks employed participants about their earnings during survey waves 4 and 8 (the ""outgoing rotation groups"")."
133~D1~V2~Variable~Wages~…this research paper focuses on hourly earnings, deflated using the consumer price index for urban workers.
133~D1~V2~Variable~Wages~…because of concerns about the imputation procedure for immigrants versus United States natives, workers with imputed earnings are not included in the earnings analysis.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…it is important to note that earnings data do not include self-employed workers.
133~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…surveys like the Current Population Survey include unauthorized immigrants but likely undercount them.
133~D1~V7~Variable~Immigrant Status~…defined as people who are not United States citizens at birth.
133~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Unauthorized Immigrants~…immigrants who have at most a high school diploma, are from Mexico, and are not naturalized United States citizens are classified as unauthorized for the purposes of this study.
133~D1~V2~Variable~Wages~…for workers not paid on an hourly basis, the researchers use weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours as hourly earnings.
133~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Naturalized Low-Education Mexican Immigrants~…those low educated Mexican immigrants who report being naturalized United States citizens as being compared with likely unauthorized immigrants.
133~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Low-Education Hispanics~…those low educated Hispanics born in the United States as being compared with likely unauthorized immigrants.
133~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Low-Education White non-Hispanics~…those low educated white non-Hispanics born in the United States as being compared with likely unauthorized immigrants.
133~D1~V8~Variable~Gender~…all of the analysis in this research is stratisfied on sex since sex differences in labor force outcomes tend to be different for immigrants than for United States natives and likely unauthorized immigrant men and women tend to work in very different industries, with men heavily concentrated in construction and women in private households, which may lead to sex differences in the effects of E-Verify mandates.
133~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Unauthorized Immigrants~…likely unauthorized male immigrants are more likely to be employed and to be in the labor force than the other three groups examined while likely unauthorized female immigrants are less likely to employed or to be in the labor force.
133~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Unauthorized Immigrants~…likely unauthorized male and female immigrants earn considerably less than the three other groups.
133~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Unauthorized Immigrants~…likely unauthorized immigrants are more likely to have switched employers since the last month than the other three groups.
133~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Unauthorized Immigrants~…likely unauthorized immigrants are more likley than the other three groups to live in states that have adopted a universal E-Verify mandate.
133~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear OLS~…with either a dummy variable for employment, unemployment, labor force participation, and switching employers as the outcome and whether or not an individual lives in a state with a universal mandate, individual characteristics that are likely to be related to labor market outcomes (including age, marital status, number of children living in the household, and education), business cycle condition, and proxies for level of construction activity in a state as the explanatory variables.
133~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear OLS~…with the natural log of real hourly earnings as the outcome and whether or not an individual lives in a state with a universal mandate, individual characteristics that are likely to be related to labor market outcomes (including age, marital status, number of children living in the household, and education), business cycle condition, and proxies for level of construction activity in a state as the explanatory variables.

133~D1~F1~Findings~Unauthorized Male Mexican Immigrants and E-Verify Mandates~…among unauthorized male Mexican immigrants, universal E-Verify mandates appear to signficantly reduce hourly earnings by 7.8%
133~D1~F2~Findings~Unauthorized Female Mexican Immigrants and E-Verify Mandates~…among unauthorized female Mexican immigrants, universal E-Verify mandates raise employment and labor force participation by a signficant 3.5 percentage points.
133~D1~V11~Variable~Marital Status~…regressions stratified by women's marital status do not indicate a signficant difference between married and unmarried women or between women married to likely unauthorized immigrant men and those married to other groups of men.
133~D1~V22~Variable~Time of Arrival~…for immigrants, specifically those unauthorized individuals, to indicate whether a respondent has moved to the United States recently or has been located their for the long term.

133~V22~L8~Variable Value~Long Term Immigrant~…those unauthorized Mexican immigrants that report arriving in the United States 10 or more years ago.
133~D1~F3~Findings~Unemployment, Time of Arrival, and E-Verify Mandates~…those unauthorized male Mexican immigrants that report arriving to the United States within the last 10 years are about significantly 4 percentage points more likely to be employed and significantly 3 percentage points less likely to be unemployed in states that have adopted an E-Verify mandate.
133~D1~F4~Findings~Unauthorized Male Immigrant Earnings Loss Concentration Based on Time of Arrival~…earnings losses are concentrated among men who arrived 10 or more years ago and those long term unauthorized male Mexican immigrants experience a significant earnings decline of 13.6% with the enactment of universal E-Verify Mandates at the state level.
133~D1~F5~Findings~Unauthorized Female Immigrant Partipation and Employment, Time of Arrival and E-Verify Mandates ~…labor force participation and employment signficantly increase by about 5.3 and 5.0 percentage points, respectively, among longer-term unauthorized female Mexican immigrants as men's earnings fall.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…although E-Verify mandates target unauthorized workers, they are likely to affect authorized workers as well.
133~D1~F6~Findings~Naturalized Immigrant Mexican Men and E-Verify Mandates~…employment and wage-and-salary employment rates and earnings increase among Mexican men who are naturalized United States citizens as states adopt universal E-Verify Mandates with employment increasing significantly by 3.7 percentage points, wage-and salary-employment increasing significantly by 9.8 percentage points, and real hourly earnings increasing significantly by 7.0%, while self-employment drops signficantly by -5.8 percentage points.
133~D1~F7~Findings~U.S. Born Hispanics and E-Verify Mandates~…as states pass universal E-Verify Mandates, earnings increase significantly among United States-born Hispanics by 8.5% while the unemployment rate increases by 4.4 percentage points; however this increase in unemployment could be related to the fact as workers perceive more job opportunities, they enter the labor force to search for employment.
133~D1~F8~Findings~Non-Hispanic Whites and Authorized Females and E-Verify Mandates~…Non-Hispanic whites and women in all three groups of authorized individuals appear to be unaffected by E-Verify mandates.
133~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Low-Education White non-Hispanics~…compete relatively little with unauthorized immigrants.
133~D1~F9~Findings~Long Term Unauthorized Male Immigrants and Hourly Earnings~…using data from 2002 to 2012, it is found that universal E-Verify mandates appear to signficantly reduce hourly earnings by 7.8% among male Mexican immigrants who are likely to be unauthorized, an effect that is concentrated among long-term United States residents (i.e. those that immigrated to the United States 10 or more years before the survey date).
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…another goal of E-Verify mandates is to improve labor market outcomes for United States natives who may compete with unauthorized immigrants.
133~D1~V23~Variable~Interstate Migration~…may reduce the labor force impacts of E-Verify mandates.
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~"…difficult to discern between those mandates that are strictly enforced from those that are merely ""on the books"", nor do the researchers know the extent of federal audits and other enforcement activities, which may be correlated with state mandates."
133~D1~V1~Variable~E-Verify Mandates~…researchers unable to identify the extent to which E-Verify is used in states with no mandate as corporations with nationwide operations that implement E-Verify in one state may decide to extend that corporate policy to other states.
134~134: How Important Is Human Capital? A Quantitative Theory Assessment of World Income Inequality~~~~
134~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
134~D1, D5, D6~T1~Time Period~1990.0~…the relevant Current Population Survey data is drawn from the 1990 survey year.
134~D8, D9, D11~F12~Findings~[epsilon], Poverty, and Relative TFP~The results in Table 5 indicate that it is important to model sectoral productivity differences for assessing the role of human capital in amplifying income differences. When [epsilon] is set at a low value, poor countries exhibit a high relative TFP in the service sector, which, in turn, leads to a low price of services relative to rich countries. Since services are a key input in the production of human capital, cheap services in poort countries operate as a force towards reducing income inequality. Nevertheless, the amplication role of human capital is large even for implausibly low values of [epsilon]. When [epsilon] = .1 the TFP elasticity of PPP output is 1.53 in the model with human capital accumulation and .86 in the economy with exogenous human capital. This differential in TFP elasticities across mode economies is not minor: To generate an income ratio of 20 the economy with endogenous human capital requires an A(M) ratio of 7.1 while the economy with exogenous human capital requires an A(M) ratio of 33.1 (see Table 5).

134~D1, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Ability~…to model heterogeneity across individuals, researchers follow the micro literature in allowing individuals to differ in terms of their ability. It is assumed that the shocks to ability are idiosyncratic to each dynasty and that they are observed at the beginning of the period, that is, before human capital investments take place.

134~D1, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Ability~Researchers emphasize that when young parents make education decisions for their children, they know the ability z.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Ability~Ability follows an AR(1) process ( in logs). In the researchers' computations, researchers approximate this stochastic process with a discrete first-order Markov chain that takes 7 possible values for ability z, using the procedure in Tauchen (1986) to compute transition probabilities.

134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV31~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of Human Capital~The amplification effect of human capital, given by (3.13), depends crucially on the expenditure elasticity of human capital (1 - [eta])[xi]. In particular, if the expenditure share is zero ([eta] = 1), then human capital does not amplify TFP differences across countries, no matter how close [xi] is to 1.
134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV31~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of Human Capital~The amplification effect of human capital accumulation is driven by the expenditure elasticity of human capital as in the one-sector growht model. 
134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV31~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of Human Capital~The quantitative results section uses the theory developed to quantitatively assess the consequences of TFP differences across countries. Researchers assume that countries are identical in terms of preferences and technologies but only differ in their level of TFP. Researchers asked the following question: What cross-country differences in TFP are required for the model economy in order to account for a 20-fold income ratio between rich and poor countries? Does human capital play an important role in amplifying income differences across countries?
134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV31~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of Human Capital~Human capital is an important source of amplication of income differences across countries for two reasons: First, human capital directly contributes to cross-country output differences because poor countries accumulate less human capital than rich countries. Second, a higher human capital stock stimulates more physical capital accumulation by raising the marginal product of capital. As a result, human capital accumulation implies the effects of TFP differences on physical capital.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV32~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences~The amplifier effect of TFP differences in the manufacturing sector on human capital differences across countries. The fact that human capital production requires services (rather than goods) makes human capital less sensitive to a reduction of TFP in the manufacturing sector.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV32~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences~The quantitative response to a change in the TFP in the manufacturing sector diminishes with the extent of a comparative advantage in producing services (decreases with [epsilon]).
134~D8, D9, D11~DV32~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences~The quantitative results section uses the theory developed to quantitatively assess the consequences of TFP differences across countries. Researchers assume that countries are identical in terms of preferences and technologies but only differ in their level of TFP. Researchers asked the following question: What cross-country differences in TFP are required for the model economy in order to account for a 20-fold income ratio between rich and poor countries? Does human capital play an important role in amplifying income differences across countries?
134~D8, D9, D11~DV32~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences~Unlike the results in Section 3, the amplication effect in the benchmark economy cannot be characterized with an analytical expression. However, there is a simple way of measuring the amplication effect of TFP in the calibrated model economy. For each value of [epsilon], researchers simulate the the model economy for different values of A(M) and run the following regression in the simulated data where Y denotes GDP. The values considered for A(M) are 1, .5, .25, and .125. Researchers run the regeression regression for GDP measured at domestic prices and PPP prices. The fact that the R-squared in all the regressions are close to 1 implies that the estimated regressions represent a good description of how A(M) and Y covary in the simulated data. The coefficient [alpha](2) can then safely be interpreted as the elasticity of output with respect to A(M).
134~D8, D9, D11~DV32~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences~One way of assessing the amplifation results in the current paper is to compare them with the findings in Hsieh and Klenow (2007). These authors perform a development accounting exercise using a growth model with no human capital accumulation and find that a one-percent rise in the TFP of the tradable sector increases output per worker by 1.04%. To show that the much larger amplication in the theory is due to human capital accumulation, researchers calibrate a version of the model economy with no investments in human capital.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV32~Derived Variable~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences~TFP amplification of output is represented in Figure 1.
134~D8, D9, D11~F13~Findings~Amplification Effect of TFP Differences Estimation Results~At a theoretical level, it is interesting to answer the following question: How does a one-percent change in TFP in all sectors in the economy affect output per workers? The answer is provided by the one-sector version of the model economy ([epsilon] = 1), and it is startling: The amplification effect is now 2.8. In a world where TFP varies uniformly across sectors, the TFP ratio needed to generate a PPP-income ratio of a factor of 20 would be only 2.9, which is about two thirds of what is implied by the two-sector model with [epsilon] existing in the range [.3, .4]. Nevertheless, from a development accounting view, the relevant amplification effect is the one estimate with the two-sector model as the evidence suggests that TFP does not vary uniformly across sectors. Researchers conclude that it is important to model both human capital and sectoral productivity differences for assessing the cross-country variation in productivity.

134~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Autoregressive (1)~"Ability follows an AR(1) process ( in logs). In the researchers' computations, researchers approximate this stochastic process with a discrete first-order Markov chain that takes 7 possible values for ability z, using the procedure in Tauchen (1986) to compute transition probabilities. Market luck [mu] is iid according to ln([mu] ~ N(0, sigma([mu])^2) approximated over 5 values similarly to z."
134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV27~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~The first constraint in the objective function is the household budget constraint, where the right-hand side is given by the sum of the earnings of the young parent and the child upon finishing school and the resources q (after tax earnings and gross asset return) brought to the current household by the old parent.
134~D3~V18~Variable~Capital-Share Parameter~The capital-share parameter is set to .33, consistent with the capital-income share in the U.S. economy from the National Income and Products Accounts.
134~D6~D6~Dataset~Census Bureau~Public education expenditures on all levels of education as a fraciton of GDP are calculated from the U.S. Censu Bureau (1999).
134~DV10~L7~Variable Value~Child's Ability~…the child's ability as factored in determining the state of a young parent.
134~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Child's Human Capital~…the human capital of a child is produced with the inputs of schooling time and expenditures in human capital quality according to a simple production function.
134~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Child's Human Capital~The human capital h[c] of an individual at the end of the first period of life evolves stochastically, according to a realization of a market luck shock [mu]': h[p] = [mu]'h[c], where [mu]' is iid across individuals and time according to a density Q[mu](mu) with a mean equal to 1. 
134~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Child's Human Capital~…the human capital technology is given by h[c] = z(s^[eta]e^(1-[eta])^[xi], where s denotes schooling time and e denotes educational expenditures. Thus, researchers need to specify two elasticity parameters.
134~DV11~L8~Variable Value~Child's Taste for Schooling~…the child's taste for schooling as factored in determining the state of a young parent.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8, D9~F5~Findings~College Attendance and Tuition~Researchers find that college attendance declines by 1.5% per 100 dollars increase in college tuition, which is close to the consensus estimates in the empirical literature review by Leslie and Krinkman and to the recent estimates in Keane and Wolpin (2001).
134~D1~V3~Variable~Consumption~…the level at which either manufacturing or sector-level output is consumed.
134~D1~V3~Variable~Consumption~Young parents choose consumption c.
134~D1~V3~Variable~Consumption~To be consistent, researchers define total consumption in their model as the sum of household consumption c and expenditures in education e. Hence, in the baseline economy the parameter [gamma] determining the share of tradable in aggregate consumption is set so that ([gamma]c)/(c+e)=.23 (author's estimate using PWT data), which implies [gamma] = .27 > .23.
134~D1~DV48~Derived Variable~Correlation of Ability and Schooling Taste~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1~DV48~Derived Variable~Correlation of Ability and Schooling Taste~The variance of schooling increases wth a rise in the heterogeneity in the returns to schooling, which can be attained with an increase in both the variance of schooling tastes and ability or with a decrease in the time share [eta]. Furthermore, these alternative ways of increasing the variance of schooling have different implications for a Mincer regression: While the explanatory power of schooling in a Mincer regression decreases with the time-share parameter, it increases with both the variance of schooling tastes and ability (the former by increasing the R-squared and the latter by increasing the slope coefficient). Moreover, it also increases with the parameter b - which controls the correlation of schooling and ability - by making ability more important than taste shocks as a source of schooling variance. Nonetheless, the parameter b has a distinct effect: While the intergenerational correlation of schooling increases with the parameter b, by making schooling tastes correlated across generations in a dynasty, this target is unaffected by the variance of ability of decreases with the variance of schooling tastes.
134~D8, D9, D10, D11~V11~Variable~Country~Consider a world with a large number of countries. Each country is populated by measure 1 of dynasties and by a vector of prices (w, P(S)) that varies across countries.
134~D8, D9, D10, D11~V11~Variable~Country~Countries differ not only with respect to the wage rate but also with respect to the relative price of education services (P(S)).
134~D1, D5, D6~DV12~Derived Variable~Current Period Utility~…the per-period utility function of the household is contingent on the consumption of manufacturing goods and consumption of services, the utility of schooling, and the schooling taste shock that varies across individuals.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV12~Derived Variable~Current Period Utility~The first term in the objective function is current period utility.
134~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…average years of schooling and the variance in years of schooling is computed from CPS data for 1990.
134~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Table 4 reports maximum attained school years by population percentiles obtained from CPS 1990 data and those generated by the model. The model slightly overpredicts educational attainments at the bottom of the distribution and underpredicts them at the top of the distribution.
134~D1, D8, D9, D10, D11~F19~Findings~Current Results Relative to Hendrick's Estimates~While Hendrick's estimates that for the five poorest countries in his sample - with an output per capita of 5.8% of the U.S. level - low factor accumulation reduces income per capita to 47% of the U.S. level. In the current paper, the reduction in output per capita accounted for by low factor accumulation is 25% - almost twice as big as estimated by Hendricks. Moreover, while the cross-country differences in schooling quantity and quality are taken as given by Hendricks, in this paper they are the result of TFP differences across countries. Nevertheless, both papers imply important TFP differences across countires: To account for a 17-fold difference in incomes across countires, Hendricks estimates that an 8-fold difference in TFPs is needed, while the current model requirees only about a half of that difference in the TFPs of the tradable sector.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~The decision problem of a young household can be written using the language of dynamic programming. The first two terms in the objective function are current period utility and the third term is expected dicounted future utility. The expectations of the next period's value function is taken over the market luck of the current child [mu]' and over the ability z' and school taste [theta]' of the child born in the next period. The first constraint is the household budget constraint. The third constraint defines the parental wealth q' of the next households in the dynasty line.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~The expectations of the next period's value function is taken over the market luck of the current child [mu]' and over the ability z' and school taste [theta]' of the child born in the next period.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~Researchers emphasize that when young parents make education decisions for their children, they know the ability z and the taste for schooling [theta]. However, they face uncertainty regarding the market luck of their children [mu]', which is realized in the adult stage of the individual's life cycle.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~Consider the decision problem of an individual with ability z in a country with a wage rate w and a price of education services P(S), where these prices are expressed in terms of the manufactured good. The human capital investment decision can be formulated as choosing schooling time (s) and expenditures (e) to maximize the present value of the lifetime earnings net of the education costs.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~In the absence of tuition costs, it is easy to solve for s and verify that the optimal quantity of schooling does not vary across individuals with different values of z. Intuitively, when there are no tuition costs of schooling a change in z raises proportionally the benefits and costs of schooling and has no effect on the optimal choice of years of schooling. Moreover, when tuition costs = 0, there is no variation in schooling across countries (w, p(S)). Researchers thus maintain that tuition is greater than 0. Similarly, in the absence of education expenditures ([eta] = 1), the quality of schooling does not vary across indiviudals and countries. On the contrary, when 0 < [eta] < 1, equations (3.7) and (3.8) imply that both quantity and quality of schooling vary across individuals (z) and countries (w, P(S)).
134~D7~D7~Dataset~Department of Education~According to the U.S. Department of Education (2007), (public and private) institutional costs for all levels of education amounted to 7% of GDP in 1990-1995. Seventy two percent of these expenditures were on teacher and staff compensation (OECD (2007)).
134~D4~V19~Variable~Depreciation Rate~The depreciation rate [delta] is selected to match an investment-to-output ratio of 20% as documented in the U.S. Congress, Joint Economics Committee (2004).
134~D1, D5, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Descendent Earnings~…the right-hand side of the budget constraint is given by the sum of the earnings of the young parent and the child upon finishing school and the resources q brought to the current household by the old parent.
134~D1~V17~Variable~Discount Factor~The discount factor [Beta] is set to target an annual interest rate of 5%, which is roughly the return on capital in the U.S. economy as measured by the average return on non-financial corporate capital net of taxes in 1990-96.
134~D1, D8~V13~Variable~Dynasty~…each country is populated by measure 1 of dynasties.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV9~Derived Variable~Educational Expenditures~…a unit of schooling time (quantity of schooling) is produced with one unit of a child's time and a variable number of units of market human capital services. In other words, schooling requires own time and human capital purchased in the market. Educational expenditures in quality are assumed to be in terms of services.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV9~Derived Variable~Educational Expenditures~…since the current calibration strategy is to use cross-sectional heterogeneity within a country to restrict the parameters governing human capital accumulation, researchers cannot abstract from the effects of public education on education and labor market outcomes. Researchers model public education by assumin that education expenditures are subsidized at the rate p per unit of schooling time. These expenditures are financed with a proportional tax on households' income. Public and privat expenditures are perfect substitutes in the production of human capital.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV9~Derived Variable~Educational Expenditures~A parent who provides his child with s years of schooling and a quality of education e incurs expenditures P(S)e+(w(l-bar) - p)s, where w(l-bar) is the cost of market human capital services per years of education, and p denotes public education expenditures (or subsidies) per year of education.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV9~Derived Variable~Educational Expenditures~In the absence of education expenditures ([eta] = 1), the quality of schooling does not vary across individuals and countries. On the contrary, when 0 < [eta] < 1, equations (3.7) and (3.8) imply that both quantity and quality of schooling vary across individuals (z) and countries (w, P(S)).
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV9~Derived Variable~Educational Expenditures~While for most products, such as cars and airline tickets, the U.S. and similarly rich economies account for most of the world transaction, this is not the case for schooling, for two reasons. First, the variation in average years of schooling across rich and poor countries is easily an order of magnitude smaller than the variation in the consumption of cars and airline tickets. Second, poor countries account for the bulk of the world population of school-aged individuals.
134~D1, D5, D6~F3~Findings~Elasticity of Children's Educational Attainment~The current model economy produces an elasticity of children's educational attainment of .16, which is well within the range of values in the empirical literature.
134~D8, D10~F8~Findings~Elasticity of GDP at PPP Prices~The elasticity of GDP - at PPP prices - with respect to A(M) is 1.94 when [epsilon] is .3 and 2.08 when [epsilon] is .4.
134~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Output~…the elasticity of output with respect to physical capital and is assumed to be equal across sectors.
134~D1, D5, D6~F11~Findings~Elasticity of Physical Capital With and Without Human Capital Investments~While the A(M) elasticity of physical capital is 2.15 in the economy with human capital accumulation, it is only 1.49 in the model with no human capital investments (as documented in Table 5 for the economy with [epsilon] = .3). Note that the strength of these effects increases when sectoral productivity differences across countries are small ([epsilon] is high). The TFP elasticities of human and physical capital rise with [epsilon] as the higher the value of this parameter the lower the comparative advantage of poor countries at producing services (see Figure 1).
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~In a one-sector growth model ([epsilon] = 1), this elasticity is equal to 1/(1-[alpha]). When [epsilon] < 1, the cross-country variation in the relative price is lower than in the one sector growth model ([epsilon] = 1). This is guite intuitive: When [epsilon] < 1, poor countries are very inefficient in producing manufacturing goods, but they are not so inefficient in producing services. Services are cheap in poor countries because these countries have a high TFP in this sector relative to manufacturing. It is also intuitive that the elasticity decreases with [epsilon]. That is, the elasticity is lower the higher the comparative advantage of poor countries is in producing education services.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~The parameter [epsilon] determines the elasticity of the TFP in the service sector to a change of the TFP in the manufacturing sector. Intuitively, [epsilon] determines the importance of cross-country heterogeneity in relative prices.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~Researchers consider experiments with [epsilon] = .3 and .4. To evaluate the sensitivity of the results, researchers also consider a 'low' and a 'high' value for the parameter [epsilon] by setting [epsilon] = .1 and [epsilon] = 1.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~For each of the values of [epsilon] considered, researchers calibrate the value of this elasticity so that the theory is consistent with the fact that the elasticity of the share of tradables in consumption expenditures with PPP output is -.13.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~TFP elasticities (regression coefficients on TFP) are indicated in square brackets.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~Since [epsilon] determines the variation in relative prices across countries, it is important to examine the implications of the theory for relative prices and test them with the evidence from the PWT. Moreover, to address the concern that the quantitative theory may be exaggerating the TFP elasticity of human capital investments, researchers examine evidence on the variation in education prices and human capital across countries.
134~D8, D9, D11~DV33~Derived Variable~Elasticity of TFP~For each value of [epsilon], researchers obtain observations for average years of schooling and output per worker by simulating economies that vary in their relative levels of TFP. In Figure 3, researchers plot cross-country data on schooling and income, taken from Cohen and Soto (2007) and Heston et al. (2002), together with the simulated data from the model economy. 
134~D1, D5, D6~V25~Variable~Enrollment Rate~...to compare results across studies, it has become standard to use the percentage change in the overall enrollment rate of 18-24 year olds in response to a tuition increase of $100 per year, expressed in dollars for the academic year 1982-1983.
134~D1, D5, D6~V25~Variable~Enrollment Rate~To evaluate the response of college enrollment to a price change in the model economy, researchers simulate a one-period unanticipated increase in college tuition $1000 in 1982-1983 dollars. This experiment is done in partial equilibrium so that factor prices are kept fixed.
134~D1, D5, D6, D9~F6~Findings~Enrollment Rates and Tuition I~In a schooling model structurally estimated with NLSY data on white young males, the authors found a decline in the college enrollment rate of 1.2% per $100 tuition increase in 1982-83. The current model predicts declines in the enrollment rate of  23.6%, 21.9%, 18.0%, and 9.8% for individuals with parents in the first through fourth income quartiles. The model is thus consistent with the evidence that tuition effects are much stronger among individuals born in families with a low parental income, although tuition effects decline with parental income more steeply in the data than int he model. Altogether the model is consistent with the micro evidence on the enrollment effects of college tuition changes.
134~D1, D5, D6, D9~F7~Findings~Enrollment Rates and Tuition II~Researchers found that a $1000 increase in tuition increases the enrollment rate by 15%. Following the literature, researchers divide by 10 to obtain the response to a change in tuition of 100 dollars. Researchers obtained quite similar results when they simulated an increase in tuition of 500 dollars. In this case, the decrease in tuition was 7.3% which implies a decline of 1.45% in enrollment per $100 increase in tuition.
134~D1~V14~Variable~Equilibrium Interest Rate~The equilibrium interest rate is given by individuals' rate of time preference p. Although the theory makes no predictions for the distribution of income, consumption, and wealth, it 
134~D1, D5, D6~F2~Findings~Experience Differentials and Level of Per-Capita Income~Using the coefficients for returns to experience for each country reported in Bils and Klenow (2000), researchers found that the earnings of a worker with 20 years of experience relative to a worker with 10 years of experience is not systematically related to the level of per-capita income across countries. In fact, researchers found a small negative correlation between returns to labor market expereince (wage growth) and per-capita income across countries, which suggests that on the job investments in human capital are not likely to be an important source of income differences across countries.
134~V11~L18~Variable Value~Fifth Country Group~…immigrants in the country group representing Mexico and Puerto Rico have on average only about 7 years of schooling. As a result, immigrants from the first four country groups exhibit high average years of schooling relative to their source-country population, and the opposite is true for the case of Mexico and Portugal.
134~V11~L14~Variable Value~First Country Group~…immigrants from the first four country groups have on average more than 12 years of schooling.
134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV26~Derived Variable~Forgone Earnings~…represents the forgone earnings in the first period of life of attending school.
134~V11~L17~Variable Value~Fourth Country Group~…immigrants from the first four country groups have on average more than 12 years of schooling.
134~D8~DV52~Derived Variable~Gross Domestic Product~…researchers emphasize that the valuation of output across countries in a model with schooling is far from trivial. Because this problem has not been addressed in the literature, it is important to discuss the source of this difficulty and how researchers deal with it. To measure GDP at PPP prices, a set of 'international prices' needs to be chosen in a manner consistent with the methodology in the Penn World Tables. the set of interational prices in the PWT is constructed by averaging prices among all countries, accoridng to the procedure established by the International Comparison Program (ICP) of the United Nations. In order to calucate the average price for a product across countries, each with its own currency, the prices in the individual countries are converted into a common numeraire currency using PPP exchange rates.
134~D8~DV52~Derived Variable~Gross Domestic Product~The choice of an international wage rate to value teachers' services across countries in a schooling model is a delicate issue. Moreover, as researchers have verified in their computational experiments, the results for output inequality across countries critically depend on the choice made. To circumvent these difficulties, researchers compute GDP at international prices net of teacher output or, equivalently, reserachers measure national income net of the salary of teachers. The advantage of this approach is that researchers avoid taking a stand on how to set the international real wage for teachers. Moreover, using data from the PWT on institutional expenditures in education, researchers have made a similar adjustment to the GDP data in the PWT by computing GDP at international prices net of institutional expenditures. Researchers verified that all statistics of interest (such as the dispersion in income per capita and the income elasticity of schooling) are not affected in a significant manner by this adjustment. To sum up, the experiment below measure GDP at international prices as follows: GDP(j)* = Y(M) + Y(S) were the price of services is set as in the baseline economy (P(S)* = P(S)^US = 1).
134~D11~D11~Dataset~Hendricks (2002)~Table 6 provides summary statistics on the data analyzed by Hendricks. The population of U.S. immigrants is divided into 4 groups according to the income-percentile of the country of origin relative to the United States. The country groups considered are the 20th, 30th, 40th and 50th to 65th percentiles of the U.S. per-capita income. The average years of schooling among immigrnts in these country groups are, respectively, 12.5, 12.8, 12.4, 14.3, and the average earnings of these immigrants are 97%, 92%, 94%, and 107% of the earnings of similarly educated workers in the United States. While Mexico and Portugal have a per-capita income of roughly 45% of the US level, researchers did not include these two countries in the 40th income percentile group because immigrants born in Mexico and Portugal have on average 7.4 years of schooling - a schooling level well below that of all other immigrants in Hendricks' sample. Nevertheless, researchers examine the data for Mexico and Portugal separately in a fifth country group.
134~D11~D11~Dataset~Hendricks (2002)~Data on relative earnings of immigrants across countries is from Hendricks (2002), adjusted by the level of schooling of the immigrant population. 
134~D1~V2~Variable~Household~…a household is composed of 3 people: old parent, young parent, and a child.
134~D1, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…the calibration implies a large share of expenditures in the human capital production, which means that a reduction in TF affects disproportionately the benefits and costs of human capital accumulation. Hence, while the benefit of obtaining human capital is proportional to TFP, the cost of education (relative to the price of output) is less than proportional to TFP. This mechanism accounts for the low schooling quantity and quality in poor countries.
134~D1, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…human capital is an important source of income differences across countries, not only because it directly contriutes to cross-country output differences, but also because a lower human capital stock discourages physical capital accumulation by lowering the marginal product of capital.
134~D1, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Human Capital~For tractability reasons and motivated by the empirical cross-country evidence, the theory abstracts from on-the-job human capital accumulation. Researchers assume that markets are imperfect in that households cannot perfectly insure against labor-market risk and the human-capital shocks affecting their descendants.
134~D1, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Human Capital~On the cost side, human capital accumulation is affected by the schooling cost and the public education subsidy. The latter is determined by the tax rate on income [tau] in equilibrium.
134~D1, D4~F1~Findings~Human Capital Accumulation and TFP Differences Across Countries~…the main finding of this paper is that human capital accumulation strongly amplifies TFP differences across countries: the elasticity of output per worker - at PPP pprices - with respect to TFP in the tradable sector is 1.94. This implies that a 5-fold difference in TFP explains a 20-fold difference in the output per worker, as is observed between the top 10% and bottom 10% of countries in the world income distribution. In contrast, when a verson of this model is solved without human capital accumulation, an 18-fold difference in the TFP of the tradable sector is required to account for the income difference between rich and poor countries.
134~DV8~L6~Variable Value~Human Capital of Young Parent~…the human capital of the young parent as factored in determining the state of a young parent.
134~D9~D9~Dataset~ICP~Note that in the data the education services provided by private non-profit institutions and government are included in the final consumption of households at their cost (see the Handbook of the International Comparison Program).
134~D9~D9~Dataset~ICP~"As discussed in the Handbook of the ICP, there is very little basis for comparing education prices across countries using tuition or fees because they usually do not cover full cost and are not market-prices due to heavy government subsidies. It is thus not possible to use (5.19) to determine an international schooling price that can be used to value schooling output across countries. As a result, the ICP uses an ""indirect approach"" which involves using data on the PPP prices of inputs to aggregate at international prices expenditures on education inputs."
134~D1, D5, D6, D11~V30~Variable~Immigrants~Researchers simulate immigrants from five potential source countries differing with respect to their TFP in order to generate comparable statistics from the model economy. Immigrants are selected so that they have an average level of schooling consistent with the data reported in Hendricks.
134~D1, D5, D6, D11~V30~Variable~Immigrants~To proceed, researchers need to take a stand on how immigrants are selected from the population in the source country. In the current model economy, equally schooled individuals can be heterogeneous in many characteristics (taste for schooling, ability, parental human capital, and wealth) and, thus, in their earnings. As a result, selection into emigration from the distribution of these characteristics has important consequences for their average earnings
134~D1, D5, D6, D11~V30~Variable~Immigrants~Researchers study in detail how different forms of selection by wealth affect the results. For each source country, researchers compute the wealth distribution for indviduals within a given schooling bracket, and entertain two possibilities on how immigrants are selected from these populations. First, as a benchmark, researchers assume that immigrants are randomly drawn from the entire wealth distribution. Second, researchers examine selection into emigration based on the household wealth and show that this type of selection successfully reconciles the relative earnings of immigrants predicted by the model with those obtained from the data. Figure 4 presents results for the case 
134~D1, D5, D6, D11~V30~Variable~Immigrants~…in showing that selection of immigrants by wealth is allowed to play a role in accounting for non-trivial patterns, researchers assume that immigrants are randomly drawn from the bottom part of the wealth distribution for individuals in a given schooling bracket. Researchers consider several cases by right-censoring the wealth distribution at different percentiles, starting from the bottom 10% and gradually extending it to include more households.
134~D1, D5, D6~F15~Findings~Income Semi-Elasticity of Schooling~Figure 3 reveals that the income semi-elasticity of schooling in the cross-country data is 2.56. All the simulated model economies generate a lower schooling-income semielasticity than in the data. The highest value of the semielasticity, 1.86, is generated by the economy with [epsilon] = 1. 
134~D1, D5, D6~DV36~Derived Variable~Intergenerational Correlation of Log Earnings~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches an intergenerational correlation of log-earnings of .5 (Mulligan (1997)).
134~D1, D5, D6~DV36~Derived Variable~Intergenerational Correlation of Log Earnings~In the current theory, the earnings of parents and children are correlated in part due to differences in parental resources (the poor invest less), and in part due to an exogenous correlation of parental and children's abilities. Thus, the correlation of ability targets the intergenerational correlation of earnings.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV44~Derived Variable~Intergenerational Correlation of Schooling~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the intergenerational correlation of schooling of .46 as obtained by regressing children's years of schooling on parental educaiton, where the latter is defined as the average years of schooling among mothers and fathers (see Hertz et al. (2007)).
134~D1, D5, D6~DV44~Derived Variable~Intergenerational Correlation of Schooling~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV44~Derived Variable~Intergenerational Correlation of Schooling~The variance of schooling increases wth a rise in the heterogeneity in the returns to schooling, which can be attained with an increase in both the variance of schooling tastes and ability or with a decrease in the time share [eta]. Furthermore, these alternative ways of increasing the variance of schooling have different implications for a Mincer regression: While the explanatory power of schooling in a Mincer regression decreases with the time-share parameter, it increases with both the variance of schooling tastes and ability (the former by increasing the R-squared and the latter by increasing the slope coefficient). Moreover, it also increases with the parameter b - which controls the correlation of schooling and ability - by making ability more important than taste shocks as a source of schooling variance. Nonetheless, the parameter b has a distinct effect: While the intergenerational correlation of schooling increases with the parameter b, by making schooling tastes correlated across generations in a dynasty, this target is unaffected by the variance of ability of decreases with the variance of schooling tastes.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV44~Derived Variable~Intergenerational Correlation of Schooling~Although the calibration targeted the intergenerational correlation of schooling, the benchmark economy is consistent with other statistics relating parental background to an offspring's schooling. According to the statistics reported in Keane and Wolpin (2001), the probability that a child attains schooling less than or equal to 12 years conditional on his highest-educated parent having less than or equal to 12 years of schooling is .71 in the data. This probability is .72 in the model. Similarly, the probability that a child attains more than 12 years of schooling conditional on his highest-educated parent having more than 12 years of schooling is .60 in the data. This probability is .67 in the model economy.
134~D2~D2~Dataset~International Comparisons Program~…using data from the International Comparisons Program (ICP) researchers show that the elasticity of the price of education relative to output is quantitatively close to the elastcity implied by the U.S.-based simulations.
134~D2~D2~Dataset~International Comparisons Program~…this data cannot take into account unmeasured quality differences in education across countries.
134~D8~V28~Variable~International Salary for Teachers~Since the salaries of teachers are a major schooling cost, the international salary for teachers is a crucial determinant of schooling expenditures at international prices. However, the U.S. wage badly approximates the actual wage used in the PWT to value education costs across countries.
134~D8~V28~Variable~International Salary for Teachers~While it is obviously important to aggregate all international prices in the model economy in a manner consistent with the PWT, this issue is of a first-order importance when it comes to aggregating teachers' wages. Because the cross-country variation in real wages is very large, incorrect weights can lead to an international salary for teachers in the model economy that is grossly at odds with the PWT. To deal with this problem, one approach would be to calibrate the model economy to replicate the world population distribution across rich and poor economies and use (5.19) to jointly solve for the set of international prices and countries' PPP exchange rates. This is a daunting task. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the simulations can mimic the world distribution of years of schooling because the calibration only targets average years of schooling in the baseline economy.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~"…motivated by the empirical studies of Neal and Johnson (1996) and Keane and Wolpin (1997), researchers focus on investments that take place ""early in the life of an individual."
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~…motivated by the empirical studies of Neal and Johnson (1996) and Keane and Wolpin (1997), researchers formulate a dynastic model of parental investments in the human capital of their children
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~…the level at which service output is invested in human capital.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~…researchers model human capital investments as taking place 'early' in the life of an individual and that include schooling as well as investments outside of formal schooling.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~…the current research assumes that households invest a lot of resources in their children outside of school (health, food, shelter, books, recreational activities and extracurricular educational activities).
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~To study a simplified version of the model economy, researchers assume complete markets and abstract from tastes for schooling. As a result, human capital investment decisions are independent of consumption decisions and maximize lifetime income.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~Researchers also study how cross-country differences in sectoral productivities generate heterogeneity in relative prices and human capital investments.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~Capital markets are assumed to be perfect so that in equilibrium individuals make efficient investments in human capital.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~Researchers have shown that cross-country differences in relative prices (w, p(s)) generate cross-country variation in human capital investments. The next step is to analyze how cross-country differences in sectoral productivities generate heterogeneity in prices across countries and, hence, in human capital investments.
134~D1, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in Human Capital~On the preferences side, human capital investments depend on tastes for schooling.
134~D1, D5, D6~V5~Variable~Investment in Physical Capital~…the level at which manufacturing output is invested in physical capital.
134~D4~D4~Dataset~Joint Economic Committee~The depreciation rate [delta] is selected to match an investment-to-output ratio of 20% as documented in the U.S. Congress, Joint Economics Committee (2004).
134~D1, D5, D6~DV20~Derived Variable~Lifetime Income~To study a simplified version of the model economy, researchers assume complete markets and abstract from tastes for schooling. As a result, human capital investment decisions are independent of consumption decisions and maximize lifetime income.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV19~Derived Variable~Lifetime Utility~Households face uncertainty over the realization in future periods of ability, school taste and market luck, hence, they maximize the expected discounted lifetime utility of all generations in the dynasty.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV19~Derived Variable~Lifetime Utility~…the third term in the objective function is expected discounted future utility.
134~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~Researchers show that the quantitative implications of the theory for income inequality - within and across countries - depend crucially on the expenditure elasticity of human capital.
134~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~Researchers analyze how variation in wages and variation in ability (z) lead to heterogeneous human capital investments across countries (derive macro elasticities). The goal is to isolate the effects of the parameters of the human capital technology on micro and macro elasticities in the current model.
134~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~Combining (3.7) and (3.8), taking logs, and differentiating with respect to ln(w), researchers obtain the cross-country (wage) elasticity of schooling.
134~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~Since E(hw) increases with the returns-to-scale parameter and decreases with the time share parameter [eta], E(hw) increases with the expenditure elasticity of human capital and is maximized when [eta] = 0 and [xi] = 1.
134~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Macroeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~As the time-share parameter [eta] decreases from 1 to 0, E(Hw) takes values in the interval [0, [eta]/1-[eta]]. For instance, when [xi] = .9, E(Hw) takes values between 0 and 9, depending on the time-share parameter. In other words, a wage ratio of 3 can generate differences in human capital per worker anywhere from a factor of 0 to 20,000.
134~D1, D8, D10~F20~Findings~Main Finding~The main finding in this research is that human capital accumulation strongly amplifies TFP differences across countries: To explain a 20-fold difference in the output per worker the model requires a 5-fold difference in the TFP of the tradable sector, versus an 18-fold difference if human capital is fixed across countries.
134~DV52~L4~Variable Value~Manufacturing Output~…denotes the output of the manufacturing sector.
134~DV52~L4~Variable Value~Manufacturing Output~…manufacturing output can be consumed or invested in physical capital. Feasibility requires that these two components add up to the actual value of manufacturing output.
134~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Market Luck~Households face uncertainty over the realization in future periods of market luck for their child.
134~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Market Luck~Researchers emphasize that when young parents make education decisions for their children, they face uncertainty regarding the market luck of their children [mu]', which is realized in the adult stage of the individual's life cycle.
134~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Market Luck~"Market luck [mu] is iid according to ln([mu] ~ N(0, sigma([mu])^2) approximated over 5 values similarly to z in the discrete first-order Markov chain estimation procedure."
134~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Market Luck~The variance of market luck is set to match the variance of earnings.
134~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Microeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~Researchers analyze how variation in wages and variation in ability (z) lead to heterogeneous human capital investments across individuals (derive micro elasticities). The goal is to isolate the effects of the parameters of the human capital technology on micro and macro elasticities in the current model.
134~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Microeconomic Expenditure Elasticity of Human Capital~To gain insights with simple algebra, it is convenient to set the life cycle productivity parameters equal to 0. Combining (3.7) and (3.8), taking logs and differentiating with respect to lnz, gives an expression for the individual (ability) elasticity of schooling. The elasticity of expenditures with respect to ability is obtained by differentiating (3.8) with respect to ln(z) where the last equality used (3.9) The elasticity of human capital with respect to the ability, is obtained by log-differentiating (3.6) with respect to ln(z) and by using (3.9) and (3.10): Taking stock of the above findings, researchers note that the elasticities of schooling and human capital with respect to ability are all the same. The magnitude of this elasticity is determined by the returns to scale in the human capital accumulation technology. For a given distribution of z in the population, variation in boht schooling and human capital increase with the returns-to-scale parameter. Hence this parameter is important for the predictions of the theory on the cross-sectional inequality in schooling and earnings.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…in this paper, researchers develop a quantitative theory of human capital investments to quantify the importance of differences in human capital versus TFP in explaining the variation in per capita income across countires.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…building a quantitative theory allows us to circumvent two major problems faced by growth accounting exercises. First, to date, there are no reliable cross-country measures of the quality of schooling across countires. If this quality is positively associated with the level of economic development, the residual in growth accounting exercises overstates the cross-country differences in TFP. A second problem arises due to the (unobserved) covariance of TFP with measures of physical and human capital, which renders output variance decomposition difficult. Developing a quantitative theory, in turn, is a challenging task due to the lack of conclusive micro-evidence on the parameters of the human capital technology.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…researchers build a model of heterogeneous individuals - who make investments in schooling quantity and quality - and use a broad set of micro facts to discipline the key parameters of the human capital technology.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~"…motivated by the empirical studies of Neal and Johnson (1996) and Keane and Wolpin (1997), researchers focus on investments that take place ""early in the life of an individual and formulate a dynastic model of parental investments in the human capital of their children. Individuals are heterogeneous in terms of ability, chooling tastes, and parental resources. Individuals across countries face different wage rates and prices for human capital inputs."
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…the model's main novelty relative to previous work in the area is the inclusion of a production technology for human capital which takes expenditures and time as inputs. The relative importance of these inputs determines the predictions of the theory for inequality both within and across countries. The intuition is simple: if schooling requires only time inputs, a change in the ability of individuals or in the wage rate affects equally the benefits and the costs of human capital accumulation, leaving the optimal level of human capital unchanged. On the other hand, when schooling requires only the input of goods, an increase in ability or in the wage rate raises benefits but not the costs of schooling, hence increasing the optimal human capital stock.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…researchers discipline their quantitative assessment with a calibration firmly grounded on United States micro evidence, exploiting the fact that the parameters governing human capital accumulation have important consequences for schooling and earnings inequality and intergenerational mobility within a country.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…they key parameters of the model are elasticities of human capital with respect to time and goods inputs.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…the baseline economy successfully matches a large number of calibration targets on schooling and earnings inequality in the U.S., such as the variances and intergenerational correlations of earnings and schooling, and the slope coefficient and R-squared in a Mincer regression.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…the model economy is consistent with several dimensions of heterogeneity in the data that were not targeted in the calibration: schooling distribution, evidence on the relationship between schooling attainment of children and resources/background of their parents, and results in the micro literature on the enrollment effects of college tuition changes.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…researchers use the model economy to quantitatively assess how variations in TFP are amplified through human capital accumulation into large differences in output per worker across countries. It is assumed that countries are identical in terms of preferences and only differ in their level of TFP. Following Hsieh and Klenow (2007) and Herrendorf and Valentinyi (2009), researchers model sectoral productivity differences across countries. Relative to the benchmark economy, it is assumed that a one percent reduction on the TFP of the manufacturing (tradable) sector is associated with a 0.3% reduction in the TFP of the service (nontradable) sector. This assumption allows the model economy to match the cross-country variation on the price of services relative to manufacturing.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…researchers consider an economy populated by overlapping generations of people who are altruistic toward their descendants and invest in the human capital of their children. Investments in human capital involve children's time and expenditures by parents that affect the quality of the human capital of their children. Parents annot borrow to finance investment in human capital.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…since the analysis in this paper focuses on steady states, time subscripts are omitted in the description of the model and use a prime to indicate the next period value of a given variable.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…there is a large number of dynasties (mass one). Individuals live for three periods, so that the model period is set to 20 years.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…to model heterogeneity across individuals, researchers follow the micro literature in allowing individuals to differ in terms of their ability and their taste for schooling. It is assumed that the shocks to ability and taste for schooling are idiosyncratic to each dynasty and that they are observed at the beginning of the period, that is, before human capital investments take place.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…had researchers assumed that individuals differ only in ability, their calibration would have exaggerated the elasticity of schooling decisions to variation in ability. In this case, the results would have likely overestimated the response of human capital investments to TFP, since in the current heory differences in ability across individuals operate similarly to differences in TFP across countries.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…reseachers assume competitive markets for factor inputs and outputs.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Researchers assume that markets are imperfect in that households cannot perfectly insure against labor-market risk and the human-capital shocks affecting their descendants. Moreover, individuals cannot borrow.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~To study a simplified version of the model economy, researchers assume complete markets and abstract from tastes for schooling. As a result, human capital investment decisions are independent of consumption decisions and maximize lifetime income.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…in the simplified model, attention is confined to a steady-state analysis.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Although the theory makes no predictions for the distribution of income, consumption, and wealth it does has improtant implications for the variation of schooling and earnings across individuals and countries.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Researchers calibrate their benchmark economy (B.E.) to data for the United States. The calibration of the baseline economy does not require taking an explicit stand on the shares of manufactured goods in consumption expenditures ([gamma]). In particular, researchers calibrate a one-sector economy with no manufacturing sector ([gamma] = 0) It is easy to show that for any fixed [gamma] existing within the range (0, 1), the two-sector model economy delivers, after an appropriate normalization of the distribution of ability and of the distribution of taste for schooling, the same equilibrium statistics as the calibrated one-sector model economy. The parameter [gamma] will affect the cross-country experiments in the next section of the paper, and its value will be determined later.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~The mapping between model parameters and targeted data moments is multidimensional, and researchers thus solve for parameter values jointly. The discussion of the calibration is divided into two parts: first, researchers discuss parameters that relate to preferences, demographics, and the production of goods, and second - parameters that relate to human capital accumulation.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~In the current model, researchers measure retruns to education by regressing indiivudal log-wages on years of education, given by the model period time s, where b(1) gives the Mincer returns to schooling.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~…the R-squared tends to increase with the age-group considered, taking values between .16 and .26.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~While the calibration only targeted the mean and variance of schooling, the model economy accounts surprisingly well for the distribution of schooling.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Table 4 reports maximum attained school years by population percentiles obtained from CPS 1990 data and those generated by the model. The model slightly overpredicts educational attainments at the bottom of the distribution and underpredicts them at the top of the distribution.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~The quantitative results section uses the theory developed to quantitatively assess the consequences of TFP differences across countries. Researchers assume that countries are identical in terms of preferences and technologies but only differ in their level of TFP. Researchers asked the following question: What cross-country differences in TFP are required for the model economy in order to account for a 20-fold income ratio between rich and poor countries? Does human capital play an important role in amplifying income differences across countries?
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~To assess the magnitude of the TFP differences needed to account for the observed disparity in per-capita income across countries, researchers first need to take a stand on the values of two key parameters ([epsilon], [gamma])
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~The quantitative experiments assume that the data counterpart to the service and manufacturing sectors in the model economy are the nontradable and tradable sectors. Researchers consider experiments with [epsilon] = .3 and .4. To evaluate the sensitivity of the results, researchers also consider a 'low' and a 'high' value for the parameter [epsilon] by setting [epsilon] = .1 and [epsilon] = 1.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Unlike the results in Section 3, the amplication effect in the benchmark economy cannot be characterized with an analytical expression. However, there is a simple way of measuring the amplication effect of TFP in the calibrated model economy. For each value of [epsilon], researchers simulate the the model economy for different values of A(M) and run the following regression in the simulated data where Y denotes GDP. The values considered for A(M) are 1, .5, .25, and .125. Researchers run the regeression regression for GDP measured at domestic prices and PPP prices. The fact that the R-squared in all the regressions are close to 1 implies that the estimated regressions represent a good description of how A(M) and Y covary in the simulated data. The coefficient [alpha](2) can then safely be interpreted as the elasticity of output with respect to A(M).
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Table 5 reports the main results in the paper.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~The current baseline experiments minimize the role of human capital in amplifying income differences across countries by assuming that human capital investments only require services. Since poor countries have a comparative advantage in the production of human capital inputs (services are relatively cheap), their low aggregate productivity is not too detrimental to human capital accumulation.
134~D1~M1~Methodology~Mincer~Researchers build a model of heterogeneous individuals - who make investments in schooling quantity and quality - to quantify the importance of differences in human capital versus TFP in explaining the variation in per-capita income across countries. Researchers use U.S. household data to pin down the key parameters - elasticities of human capital with respect to time and goods inputs - driving the quantitative implications of the theory across countries.
134~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Products Accounts~The capital-share parameter is set to .33, consistent with the capital-income share in the U.S. economy from the National Income and Products Accounts.
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~…researchers discipline their quantitative assessment with a calibration firmly grounded on United States micro evidence.
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~…researchers use U.S. household data to pin down the key parameters  of the model - elasticities of human capital with respect to time and goods inputs - driving the quantitative implications of the theory across countries.
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~Researchers calibrate their benchmark economy (B.E.) to data for the United States. 
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~The mapping between model parameters and targeted data moments is multidimensional, and researchers thus solve for parameter values jointly. 
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~…NLSY data is used in estimating Mincer regressions.
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~…a schooling model is structurally estimated with NLSY data on white young males.
134~D1~D1~Dataset~NLSY~Since the theory is about lifetime inequality, researchers estimated Mincer returns using the NLSY to proxy lifetime earnings with 6-year averages of the earnings of males aged 30-45.
134~D1~V7~Variable~Old Parent Resources~…the disposable income and assets of the old parent as factored in determining the state of a young parent.
134~D1~V7~Variable~Old Parent Resources~…the right-hand side of the budget constraint is given by the sum of the earnings of the young parent and the child upon finishing school and the resources q brought to the current household by the old parent.
134~D1~V7~Variable~Old Parent Resources~…after tax earnings and gross asset return.
134~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the intergeneration correlation of schooling is obtained by regressing children's years of schooling on parental education.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV35~Derived Variable~Parameter Vector~To sum up, there are ten parameters determining human capital accumulation: {[xi], [eta], p(z), [sigma](z), [sigma]([mu]), l-bar, [tau], [theta](L), [theta](H), b}.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV35~Derived Variable~Parameter Vector~These parameters are calibarated so that in the equilibrium the model economy matches the following ten targets from the U.S. data: 1. Intergenerational correlation of log-earnings of .5 (Mulligan (1997)). 2. Variance of log of permanent earnings of .36 (Mulligan (1997)). 3. Average years of schooling of 12.63, computed from CPS data for 1990. 4. Variance of schooling of 8.47, computed from CPS data for 1990. 5. Public education expenditures on all levels of education as a fraction of GDP of 3.9% from the U.S. Census Bureau (1999). In computing this statistic in the data, researchers treat as public expenditures all state and federal expenditures. Researchers view local public expenditures as private because they are closely tied to property values and, therefore, to the incomes of parents. 6. The variance of individual fixed effects accounts for 2/3 of the variance of log-earnings (Zimmerman (1992)). In the current model, fixed effects are due to heterogeneity in parental resources, abilities, and tastes for schooling. The rest of the variation in earnings is due to market luck. Thus, the variance of fixed effects relative to the variance of earnings (in logs) is given by 1 - ([sigma]([mu])^2)/(var(ln(h(c))). 7. A Mincer return to schooling of 10%. Since the theory is about lifetime inequality, researchers estimate Mincer returns using the NLSY to proxy lifetime earnings with 6-year averages of the earnings of males aged 30-45. Researchers obtained Mincer returns in the range .09 to .11, depending on the age group considered. In the current model, researchers measure returns to education by regressing individual log-wages on years of education where b(1) gives the Mincer returns to schooling. 8. R-squared in the Mincer regression of .22. Researchers find that the R-squared tends to increase with the age-group considered, taking values between .16 and .26. Because the average value of R-squared over the life cycle is about .22, researchers set this value as a calibration target. 9. Teacher and staff compensation share in GDP of .05. According to the U.S. Department of Education (2007), (public and private) institutional costs for all levels of education amounted to 7% of GDP in 1990-1995. 72% of these expenditures were on teacher and staff compensation (OECD (2007)). In the model, this expenditure corresponds to the w(l-bar)s cost of schooling aggregated across household. 10. Intergenerational correlation of schooling of .46 as obtained by regressing children's years of schooling on parental education, where the latter is defined as the average years of schooling among mothers and fathers.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV35~Derived Variable~Parameter Vector~…the calibration of this parameter vector solves a rather complicated multidimensional mapping. Nonetheless it is useful to discuss how model parameters affect some specific targets.
134~D1~V24~Variable~Parental Education~…defined as the average years of schooling among mothers and fathers.
134~D1~V15~Variable~Parental Wealth~The third constraint in the objective function defines the parental wealth q' of the nest household in the dynasty line.
134~D8~D8~Dataset~Penn World Tables~To measure GDP at PPP prices, a set of 'international prices' needs to be chosen in a manner consistent with the methodology in the Penn World Tables (hereafter, PWT). The set of 'international prices' in the PWT is constructed by averaging among all countries, according to the procedures established by the International Comparison Program (ICP) of the United Nations.
134~D8~D8~Dataset~Penn World Tables~Note that the set of international prices and the PPP exchange rates in the PWT are jointly determined as the solution to a system of equations involving prices for all goods and PPP exchange rates for all countries
134~D8~D8~Dataset~Penn World Tables~The distribution of quantities transacted across countries for various commodities can be aggregated as in the PWT data.
134~D8~D8~Dataset~Penn World Tables~...the U.S. wage badly approximates the actual wage used in the PWT to value education costs across countries.
134~D8~D8~Dataset~Penn World Tables~…using data from the PWT on institutional expenditures in education, researchers have made a similar adjustments to the GDP data in the PWT by computing GDP at international prices net of institutional expenditures.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV7~Derived Variable~Physical Capital~…physical capital is accumulated contingent on the amount of investment goods produced in the manufacturing sector.
134~D10~V26~Variable~PPP Exchange Rate~Each national price is converted into a common numeraire currency by dividing by the country's PPP exchange rate E^j, and then averaged across all countries.
134~D10~V26~Variable~PPP Exchange Rate~Note that the set of international prices and the PPP exchange rates in the PWT are jointly determined as the solution to a system of equations involving prices for all goods and PPP exchange rates for all countries. Solving such a system of equations in our model economy is a very demanding task as it involves simulating a set of model economies. the simulated model economies should mimic the world distribution of countries in terms of their population sizes and income distribution. In this way, the distribution of quantities transacted across countries for various commodities can be aggregated as in the PWT data. To circumvent this difficult problem, researchers typically calibrate the baseline economy to the US and set international prices equal to the prices in the baseline economy. this approach is motivated by the fact that, because the PWT use aggregate quantities to aggregate country prices, rich country prices are weighted more than poor-country prices. Below, researchers argue that this approach has some serious drawbacks when applied to a model of schooling, such as the one in this paper.
134~V26~L13~Variable Value~PPP Exchange Rates for Education~The PWT define PPP exchange rates for education as education expenditures in national currency divided by their real value in international dollars. The education PPP exchange rates are computed with data on expenditures by educational institutions, for there are no cross-country data on educational expenditures at the level of the household.
134~D8, D10~V29~Variable~PPP Income~Model PPP income is normalized by the 1990 U.S. GDP at PPP prices in Figure 1. Solid points represent simulated economies; lines are OLS regressions with log-TFP in manufacturing sector as an explanatory variable. TFP elasticities (regression coefficients on TFP) are indicated in square brackets
134~D1, D5, D6~F16~Findings~Prediction Accuracy of the Estimated Earnings Gap~When immigrants are randomly drawn from the entire wealth distribution (100th percentile on Figure 4), the model tends to overpredict the earnings gap between workers of the same schooling level in rich and poort countries. While the earnings gap for immigrant born in countries below the 50th percentile are about .80 in the model, it is above .90 in the data. On the other hand, the model overpredicts the relative earnings for immigrants born in Mexico and Portugal, producing a ratio of 1.04 relative to a .93 in the data. Moreover, the model cannot account for the fact that immigrants from countries in the 50th percentile earn about 7% more than Americans, an observation suggesting that schooling quality is higher in this group of countries than the U.S.
134~D2, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Price of Education~…the price of education services is denoted by P(S), where this price is expressed in terms of the manufactured good.
134~D2, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Price of Education~The cost of schooling includes expenditures in human capital quality (e), time-purchases on the market (tuition costs) per unit of schooling, and foregone earnings in the first period of life.
134~D2, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Price of Education~Countries differ not only with respect to the wage rate but also with respect to the relative price of education services (P(S)).
134~D2, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Price of Education~On the cost side, human capital accumulation is affected by the schooling cost.
134~D2, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Price of Education~The price of education is obtained as the ratio of education expenditures at domestic prices to expenditures at international prices.
134~D2, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Price of Education~The valuation of education inputs and the comparison of education prices across countries is a difficult task for many reasons. First, private investments in education are unobserved. Second, while the PWT reports aggregate data on institutional expenditures on education, there may be unmeasured quality differences in the institutional expenditures across countries. Third, as discussed in the measurement section (5.2), the choice of an international wage rate to value teaching services across countries is far from trivial. In light of these difficulties, researchers propose two proxies for the price of education: the price of sercices relative to the price of manufactured goods and the wage relative to the price of output, motivated by the fact that human capital production requires teacher time and expenditures on education services.
134~D8~F14~Findings~Price of Institutional Expenditures in Education Trends to Increase with Income Across Counries~Figure 2b documents that in the data the price of institutional expenditures in education tends to increase with income across countries albeit the relationship is not very strong (.046) and not statistically significant at conventional levels. Moreover, when researchers exclude data from African countries, the estimated income elasticiy of the education price becomes highly significant and equal to .58. This value is quantitatively close to the predictions of the current theory: Researchers' simulated economies with [epsilon] = .3 and .4 deliver income elasticities of .64 and .65 when they measure the price of education using the real wage in terms of PPP output. Hence, if anything, the price of education inputs rises a little too fast with the level of economic development in their simulations relative to the data, suggesting that the quantitative results understate human capital differences across countries. Researchers conclude that the evidence supports the mechanism driving the effects of TFP on human capital accumulation in their theory: While the benefit of obtaining human capital is proportional to TFP, the cost of education (relative to the price of output) is less than proportional to TFP implying that the incentives to accumulate human capital are much stronger in rich than poor countries.
134~D8~DV56~Derived Variable~Price of Services Relative to the Price of Manufactured Goods~…as one of two proposed proxies for the price of education.
134~D8~DV56~Derived Variable~Price of Services Relative to the Price of Manufactured Goods~Figure  2a plots cross-country data on the price of services versus per-capita income from the PWT for the year 1996 as well as the simulated model data. Note that the elasticity of the relative price of services with respect to PPP output is .30 in the PWT data, which is quite close to the .29 value predicted by the economy with [epsilon] = .4 and to the .36 value obtained in the economy with [epsilon] = .3. The economies with [epsilon] = 1 and [epsilon] = .1 have counterfactual predictions for the variation in the price of services across countries: The former implies no variation in relative prices across countries while th elatter grossly overpredicts the variation in the data (Figure 2a). Researchers conclude that the evidence supports values of [epsilon within the range [.3, .4], with the best fit of the data obtained when the value of [epsilon] is close to .4.
134~D1, D2, D7, D8, D9, D10, D14~DV29~Derived Variable~Prices~While for most products, such as cars and airline tickets, the U.S. and similarly rich economies account for most of the world transaction, this is not the case for schooling, for two reasons. First, the variation in average years of schooling across rich and poor countries is easily an order of magnitude smaller than the variation in the consumption of cars and airline tickets. Second, poor countries account for the bulk of the world population of school-aged individuals. Thus, (5.19) is likely to put a significant mass on the salaries of teachers in poor countries.
134~D1, D2, D7, D8, D9, D10, D13~DV29~Derived Variable~Prices~Note that the set of international prices and the PPP exchange rates in the PWT are jointly determined as the solution to a system of equations involving prices for all goods and PPP exchange rates for all countries. Solving such a system of equations in our model economy is a very demanding task as it involves simulating a set of model economies. the simulated model economies should mimic the world distribution of countries in terms of their population sizes and income distribution. In this way, the distribution of quantities transacted across countries for various commodities can be aggregated as in the PWT data. To circumvent this difficult problem, researchers typically calibrate the baseline economy to the US and set international prices equal to the prices in the baseline economy. this approach is motivated by the fact that, because the PWT use aggregate quantities to aggregate country prices, rich country prices are weighted more than poor-country prices. Below, researchers argue that this approach has some serious drawbacks when applied to a model of schooling, such as the one in this paper.
134~D1, D2, D7, D8, D9, D10, D12~DV29~Derived Variable~Prices~The set of 'internatonal prices' in the PWT is constructed by averaging prices among all countries, according to the procedures established by the International Comparison Program (ICP) of the United Nationa. In oder to calucate the average price for a product across countries, each with its own currency, the prices in the individual countries are converted into a common numeraire currency using PPP exchange rates. The average price for good i is defined as a summation function for i = 1,...,n, where p(i)^j and q(i)^j represent the price and quantity of product i in country j. Each national price is converted into a common numeraire currency by dividing by the country's PPP exchange rate E^j, and then averaged across all countries. The resulting price P(i) is a weighted arithmetic average of the converted national price using the quantity shares as weights. Thus P(i) is the total value of the world transactions for good i expressed in terms of PPP exchange rates, divided by the total quantity of the good.
134~D1, D2, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11~DV29~Derived Variable~Prices~…each country is populated by a vector of prices (w, P(S)) that varies across countries.
134~D1, D5, D7~DV34~Derived Variable~Probability of High-Taste Shock~Ability is drawn first, then the schooling taste is determined
134~D1, D5, D6~DV34~Derived Variable~Probability of High-Taste Shock~To allow for tastes for schooling to be correlated with ability, researchers let the probability of the high-taste shock to increase with ability. Note that b > 0 implies that taste for schooling and ability are positively correlated. Thus, three parameters need to be specified for the tastes of schooling: two values for schooling tastes {[theta](L), [theta](H)} and parameter b, governing the correlation of the abilities and schooling tastes.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV4~Derived Variable~Production Technologies~…researchers assume that production takes place in two sectors - manufacturing and services - with separate production technologies.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV4~Derived Variable~Production Technologies~…this measure is contingent on the services of physical and human capital used in each sector, the elasticity of output with respect to physical capital, and the sectoral TFP, which is allowed to vary across sectors.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV4~Derived Variable~Production Technologies~Assume that countries differ in their relative productivities across sectors (for all j: A(S)^j) = A(M)^j)^[epsilon] with [epsilon] < 1). 
134~D1, D5, D6~DV4~Derived Variable~Production Technologies~Researchers normalize the units in which output is measured so that A(S) = A(M) = 1.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV39~Derived Variable~Public Education Expenditures as a Fraction of GDP~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches public education expenditures on all levels of education as a fraction of GDP of 3.9% from the U.S. Census Bureau (1999). In computing this statistic in the data, researchers treat as public expenditures all state and federal expenditures. Researchers view local public expenditures as private because they are closely tied to property values and, therfore, to the incomes of parents.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~DV39~Derived Variable~Public Education Expenditures as a Fraction of GDP~Given mean years of schooling, the cost of teachers, and the income tax rate to finance public education expenditures are almost directly pinned down by the share of teacher and staff salaries on GDP and by the share of public education expenditures in GDP (that is the distribution of schooling matters little).
134~D9~V4~Variable~Public Education Subsidies~…p denotes public education expenditures (or subsidies) per year of education.
134~D9~V4~Variable~Public Education Subsidies~On the cost side, human capital accumulation is affected by the public education subsidy. This is determined by the tax rate on income [tau] in equilibrium.
134~D10~D10~Dataset~PWT~The PWT define PPP exchange rates for education as education expenditures in national currency divided by their real value in international dollars. The education PPP exchange rates are computed with data on expenditures by educational institutions, for there are no cross-country data on educational expenditures at the level of the household. Figure 2b plots the PWT data on the price of education, normalized by the PPP price of GDP, and the PPP output per capita. The model counterpart is the wage rate, normalized accordingly.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~V10~Variable~Quality Education Expenditures~Young parents choose resources spent on the quality of education of their children e.
134~D2, D6, D7, D8~V10~Variable~Quality Education Expenditures~the cost of schooling includes expenditures in human capital quality (e).
134~D8~V27~Variable~Quantity~…q(i)^j represents the quantity of product (i) in country j.
134~D1~DV42~Derived Variable~R-Squared~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy's R-squared in the Mincer regression of .22. Researchers find that the R-squared tends to increase with the age-group considered, taking values between .16 and .26 (Table 3). Because the average value of R-squared over the life cycle is about .22, researchers set this value as a calibration target.
134~D1~DV49~Derived Variable~R-Squared~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1~DV49~Derived Variable~R-Squared~…an increase in the variance of ability raises the importance of labor market returns in schooling decisions, hence raising the R-squared and the schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression. 
134~D1~DV49~Derived Variable~R-Squared~Moreover, while the targets for Mincer returns and for the R-squared tend to move together in response to parameters changes, the relative magnitudes of these responses depend on the parameter being changed
134~D11~DV57~Derived Variable~Ratio of Earnings Between Immigrants and Natives~Researchers simulate immigrants from five potential source countries differing with respect to their TFP in order to generate comparable statistics from the model economy. Immigrants are selected so that they have an average level of schooling consistent with the data reported in Hendricks. Researchers then compute the ratio of earnings between immigrants and equally schooled workers in the Benchmark Economy and compare these results to the evidence in Hendricks.
134~D11~DV57~Derived Variable~Ratio of Earnings Between Immigrants and Natives~The average earnings ratio observed among immigrants born in Mexico and Puerto Rico can be accounted for if immigrants from these countries were drawn from the bottom 60% of the wealth distribution. A similar picture emerges for the economy with [epsilon] = .4.
134~D8, D9, D11~F9~Findings~Ratio of TFP in Tradables and PPP Income Ratio~The ratio of TFP in tradables needed to explain a PPP-income ratio of a factor of 20 is 4.7 when [epsilon] = .3 and 4.0 when [epsilon] = .4. These findings imply a substantial amplification of TFP differences across countries. The mechanism generating a large income disparity is that low TFP leads individuals in poor countries to invest fewer resources into accumulating both physical and human capital relative to individuals in rich countries.
134~D2, D9, D10, D12~DV22~Derived Variable~Relative Prices~...this price ratio drives the variation in human capital investments across countries.
134~D2, D9, D10, D11~DV22~Derived Variable~Relative Prices~Researchers also study how cross-country differences in sectoral productivities generate heterogeneity in relative prices and human capital investments.
134~D1~V20~Variable~Relative-Risk-Aversion Parameter~Researchers set the relative-risk-aversion parameter [sigma] to 2. There is no direct empirical counterpart for this parameter in the empirical literature since the current model period is 20 years, and there is an infinite intertemporal substitution of consumption within a period. However, researchers consider a value of [sigma] that is in the range of values considered in quantitative studies with heterogeneous agents.
134~D1, D5, D8~DV41~Derived Variable~Return to Schooling~Moreover, while the targets for Mincer returns and for the R-squared tend to move together in response to parameters changes, the relative magnitudes of these responses depend on the parameter being changed
134~D1, D5, D7~DV41~Derived Variable~Return to Schooling~…note that the returns to schooling is affected by tastes and ability, where the former determines the utility of schooling and the latter the labor market returns to schooling. By making the utility of schooling more prominent in schooling decisions, an increase in the mean of schooling tastes reduces the explanatory power of schooling on earnings.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV41~Derived Variable~Return to Schooling~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches a Mincer return to schooling of 10%. Since the current theory is about lifetime inequality, researchers estimate Mincer returns using the NLSY to proxy lifetime earnings with 6-year averages of the arnings of males aged 30-45. Researchers obtained Mincer returns in the range .09 to .11, depending on the age group considered. In the current model, researchers measure returns to education by regressing individual log-wages on years of education, given by the model period times s, where b(1) gives the Mincer returns to schooling.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV45~Derived Variable~Returns to Scale in Human Capital Technology~The parameter [xi] - determining returns to scale in the human capital technology - targets the variance of individual fixed effects.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV50~Derived Variable~Schooling Quantity~Given that the theory in the current research does not overstate schooling differences across countries, researchers then ask if the cross-country differences in the quality of schooing across similar schooling levels are reasonable.
134~D1, D5, D6, D9~DV14~Derived Variable~Schooling Variation~…schooling is a Leontief function of own time t and market human capital services.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8~DV14~Derived Variable~Schooling Variation~…researchers model many sources of schooling variation across individuals because their calibration will target the variance in schooling in the US economy.
134~V11~L15~Variable Value~Second Country Group~…immigrants from the first four country groups have on average more than 12 years of schooling.
134~D3, D6~DV3~Derived Variable~Sectoral Total Factor Productivity~…relative to the benchmark economy, researchers assume that a one percent reduction on the TFP of the manufacturing (tradable) sector is associated with a 0.3% reduction in the TFP of the service (nontradable) sector.
134~D3, D6~DV3~Derived Variable~Sectoral Total Factor Productivity~…represents sectoral TFP, which is allowed to vary across sectors.
134~D3, D6~DV3~Derived Variable~Sectoral Total Factor Productivity~…researchers build a model of heterogeneous individuals - who make investments in shooling quantity and quality - to quantify the importance of differences in human capital versus TFP in explaining the variation in per-capita income across countries.
134~D3, D6~DV3~Derived Variable~Sectoral Total Factor Productivity~…to make progress assume that A(S)^j = A(M)^j)^[epsilon] for all j, with A(S)^US = A(M)^US = 1 and [epsilon] < 1. This assumption implies that a 1% change in the TFP of the manufacturing sector is associated with an [epsilon]-percentage change in the TFP of the service. Note that the case where [epsilon] = 1 corresponds to the standard one-sector growth model with no variation in relative prices across countries. [epsilon] < 1 implies that services are cheaper, in terms of manufacturing goods, in poor countries than in rich countries.
134~D3, D6~DV3~Derived Variable~Sectoral Total Factor Productivity~The real wage rate, measured in terms of manufacturing goods, increases with the TFP of the manufacturing sector.
134~D6, D8~F17~Findings~Selection and the Degree of Truncation in the Wealth Distribution~Note in Figure 4 that selection is more important the more truncated the wealth distribution is. The case of no selection corresponds to the assumption that immigrants are drawn from the entire wealth distributions (i.e. no truncation). Also in figure 4, researchers find that immigrants' human capital tends to decline with parental weath for the first four country groups. On the other hand, earnings increase with parental wealth in the fifth country group representing Mexico and Portugal.
134~DV52~L5~Variable Value~Service Output~…denotes the output of the service sector.
134~DV52~L5~Variable Value~Service Output~…services can be either consumed or invested in human capital. Feasibility requires that these two components add up to the actual value of service output.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Services of Human Capital~…represents the services of human capital used in each sector.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Services of Physical Capital~…represents the services of physical capital used in each sector.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV51~Derived Variable~Share of Manufacturing Goods~The parameter [gamma] pins down the share of manufacturing goods in consumption. Intuitively, [gamma] affects how the variation prices impact on investment decisions and output per worker across countries.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV51~Derived Variable~Share of Manufacturing Goods~Recall that the parameter [gamma] - determining the share of manufacturing goods in consumption - does not affect equilibrium statistics in the benchmark economy. With no loss of generality, researchers can then set [gamma] = .27 in the Benchmark Economy so that this economy is consistent with the share of services in consumption expenditures in the U.S. Note that in the data the share of services in aggregate consumption expenditures increases with per-capita income across countries, suggesting that the parameter [gamma] varies with the level of economic development. To match the variation in the share of services in consumption expenditures across countries, the experiments below assume that the parameter [gamma] varies with TFP in the manufacturing sector with a constant elasticity.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV51~Derived Variable~Share of Manufacturing Goods~To be consistent, researchers define total consumption in their model as the sum of household consumption c and expenditures in education e. Hence, in the baseline economy the parameter [gamma] determining the share of tradable in aggregate consumption is set so that ([gamma]c)/(c+e)=.23 (author's estimate using PWT data), which implies [gamma] = .27 > .23.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~…to model heterogeneity across individuals, researchers follow the micro literature in allowing individuals to differ in terms of their tastes for schooling. It is assumed that the shocks to tastes for schooling are idiosyncratic to each dynasty and that they are observed at the beginning of the period, that is, before human capital investments take place.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~…the taste shock is i.i.d across individuals and, possibly, correlated with the current realization of the ability shock. The distribution of the taste shcok is thus descriibed by a discrete matrix.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~…in the model, heterogeneity in schooling decisions is driven by variation not only in parental wealth and labor market returns (ability) but also in schooling tastes.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~Households face uncertainty over the realization in future periods of school taste.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~Researchers emphasize that when young parents make education decisions for their children, they know the taste for schooling [theta].
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~The mean value for schooling taste 0.5([theta](L) + [theta](H)) can be targeted to mean years of schooling, as the utility of schooling increases the benefits of schooling time. However, this parameter has important consequences for other targets as well.
134~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling~…changes in schooling tastes (mean and variance) tend to have a strong impact on the R-squared, and changes in the standard deviation of ability tend to have a strong impact on the schooling coefficient of the Mincer regression.
134~D1, D5, D6~F18~Findings~Taste for Schooling and Returns for Schooling Among Immigrants Positively Selected for the Schooling Distribution~When immigrants are positively selected from the schooling distribution, they tend to exhibit a relatively high taste for schooling. In this case, the rate of return to schooling is a relatively less important determinant of schooling decisions. Moreover, the importance of returns to education for schooling decisions diminishes with parental wealth: Wealthy individuals tend to care more about the utility of schooling as they have a low marginal utility of consumption. As a result, conditional on a level of schooling, individuals with wealthy backgrounds tend to be of a relatively low ability and to spend little on education. This accounts for the negative relationship between earnings and parental wealth among highly-schooled immigrants. The current findings show that the case of Mexico and Portugal is quite different. Immigrants from these countries are relatively low-schooled and care little about the utility of schooling. The rate of return to schooling is the main driving force behind their schooling decisions. A more favorable parental background is associated with more human capital expenditures and, hence, higher human capital.
134~D1~DV47~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling Variance~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1~DV47~Derived Variable~Taste for Schooling Variance~…changes in schooling tastes (mean and variance) tend to have a strong impact on the R-squared, and changes in the standard deviation of ability tend to have a strong impact on the schooling coefficient of the Mincer regression.
134~D8~V21~Variable~Tax Rate~…[tau] denotes the tax rate on income in equilibrium.
134~D8, D9, D10, D11~DV43~Derived Variable~Teacher and Staff Compensation Share in GDP~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy has a teacher and staff compensation share in GDP of .05. According to the U.S. Department of Education (2007), (public and private) institutional costs for all levels of education amounted to 7% of GDP in 1990-1995. 72% of these expenditures were on teacher and staff compensation (OECD (2007)). In the model, this expenditure corresponds to the w(l-bar)s cost of schooling aggregated across households.
134~D8, D9, D10, D11~DV43~Derived Variable~Teacher and Staff Compensation Share in GDP~Given mean years of schooling, the cost of teachers, and the income tax rate to finance public education expenditures are almost directly pinned down by the share of teacher and staff salaries on GDP and by the share of public education expenditures in GDP (that is the distribution of schooling matters little).
134~D8, D9, D11~DV54~Derived Variable~TFP Ratio~To assess what the estimated elasticities imply for understanding the observed income differences across countries, researchesr compute the TFP ratio in the manufacturing sector needed to generate a ratio of aggregate income at PPP prices of 20. This ratio is roughly the PPP-income ratio between the 10% richest countries to the 10% poorest countries in the world income distribution.
134~D8, D10~F10~Findings~The Elasticity of Output at PPP Prices~When [epsilon] = .3 and human capital is exogenous, the A(M) elasticity of output at PPP prices is 1.05, which is quite close to the 1.04 estimated by Hsieh and Klenow. The ratio of TFP in manufacturing to explain a PPP-income ratio of a factor of 20 is now 17.5, which is much higher than the 4.7 ratio in the economy with investments in human capital.
134~V11~L16~Variable Value~Third Country Group~…immigrants from the first four country groups have on average more than 12 years of schooling.
134~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV25~Derived Variable~Time Purchases on the Market~…w(l-bar) is the cost of market human capital services per year of education.
134~D1, D2, D7~DV30~Derived Variable~Time Share Parameter~…[eta] represents the time-share parameter. This is the share of expenditures spent on human capital investments.
134~D1, D2, D7~DV30~Derived Variable~Time Share Parameter~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1, D5, D6~V9~Variable~Time Spent in School~Young parents choose time spent in school by their children s (where 1 - s is the working time of the children).
134~D2, D6, D7, D8, D9~F4~Findings~Total Cost of Education as a Share of GDP~Computed as the sum of (P(S)e + w(l-bar)s) over all students, the total cost of education accounts for 14.3% of GDP, a value slightly below the estimate of Haveman and Wolfe (1995).
134~D9~V16~Variable~Tuition Costs~In the absence of tuition costs, it is easy to solve for s and verify that the optimal quantity of schooling does not vary across individuals with different values of z. Intuitively, when there are no tuition costs of schooling a change in z raises proportionally the benefit and costs of schooling and has no effect on the optimal choice of years of schooling. Moreover, when tuition is equal to 0, there is no variation in schooling across countries (w, p(S)). Researchers thus maintain that tuition is greater than 0.
134~D9~V16~Variable~Tuition Costs~Typically, the effects of college costs on enrollment are identified from time series and cross-state variations in tuition rates and grant levels.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8, D9, D12~DV13~Derived Variable~Utility from Schooling~…note that the returns to schooling is affected by tastes and ability, where the former determines the utility of schooling and the latter the labor market returns to schooling. By making the utility of schooling more prominent in schooling decisions, an increase in the mean of schooling tastes reduces the explanatory power of schooling on earnings.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8, D9, D11~DV13~Derived Variable~Utility from Schooling~The functional form specified for the utility of schooling allows for a diminishing marginal utility from schooling and a bounded marginal utility from schooling at zero level of schooling.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8, D9, D10~DV13~Derived Variable~Utility from Schooling~…the utility of schooling for a certain individuals as included in computing the per-period utility function of the household.

134~D1, D5, D6~DV46~Derived Variable~Variance of Ability~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV46~Derived Variable~Variance of Ability~…an increase in the variance of ability raises the importance of labor market returns in schooling decisions, hence raising the R-squared and the schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression. 
134~D1, D5, D6~DV40~Derived Variable~Variance of Individual Fixed Effects~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches a variance of individual fixed effects accounting for 2/3 of the variance of log-earnings (Zimmerman (1992)). In the current model, fixed effects are due to heterogeneity in parental resources, abilities, and tastes for schooling. The rest of the variation in earnings is due to market luck. Thus, the variance of fixed effects relative to the variance of earnings (in logs) is given by 1 - ([sigma]([mu])^2)/(var(ln(h(c))).
134~D1, D5, D6~DV37~Derived Variable~Variance of Log Permanent Earnings~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches a variance of log of permanent earnings of .36 (Mulligan (1997)).
134~D5~DV38~Derived Variable~Variance of Schooling~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches a variance of schooling of 8.47, computed from CPS data for 1990.
134~D5~DV38~Derived Variable~Variance of Schooling~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D5~DV38~Derived Variable~Variance of Schooling~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D5~DV38~Derived Variable~Variance of Schooling~The variance of schooling increases wth a rise in the heterogeneity in the returns to schooling, which can be attained with an increase in both the variance of schooling tastes and ability or with a decrease in the time share [eta]. Furthermore, these alternative ways of increasing the variance of schooling have different implications for a Mincer regression: While the explanatory power of schooling in a Mincer regression decreases with the time-share parameter, it increases with both the variance of schooling tastes and ability (the former by increasing the R-squared and the latter by increasing the slope coefficient). Moreover, it also increases with the parameter b - which controls the correlation of schooling and ability - by making ability more important than taste shocks as a source of schooling variance. Nonetheless, the parameter b has a distinct effect: While the intergenerational correlation of schooling increases with the parameter b, by making schooling tastes correlated across generations in a dynasty, this target is unaffected by the variance of ability of decreases with the variance of schooling tastes.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8~V12~Variable~Wage Rate~…wage rate is denoted by w, where this price is expressed in terms of the manufactured good.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8~V12~Variable~Wage Rate~Countries differ not only with respect to the wage rate but also with respect to the relative price of education services (P(S)).
134~D1, D5, D6, D8~V12~Variable~Wage Rate~The real wage rate, measured in terms of manufacturing goods, increases with the TFP of the manufacturing sector.
134~D1, D5, D6, D8~V12~Variable~Wage Rate~The real wage - expressed in terms of education services - does not increase with per-capita income across countries as much as in the one-sector growth model. 
134~D1, D5, D6, D8~V12~Variable~Wage Rate~The choice of an international wage rate to value teachers' services across countries in a schooling model is a delicate issue.
134~D8~DV53~Derived Variable~Wage Relative to the Price of Output~…as one of two proposed proxies for the price of education.
134~D6, D9~DV58~Derived Variable~Wealth Distribution~Figure 4 graphs, for [epsilon] = .3 and [epsilon] = .4, how average earnings vary as immigrants are increasingly drawn from wealthier background.
134~D6, D8~DV58~Derived Variable~Wealth Distribution~Researchers study in detail how different forms of selection by wealth affect the results. For each source country, researchers compute the wealth distribution for indviduals within a given schooling bracket, and entertain two possibilities on how immigrants are selected from these populations. First, as a benchmark, researchers assume that immigrants are randomly drawn from the entire wealth distribution. Second, researchers examine selection into emigration based on the household wealth and show that this type of selection successfully reconciles the relative earnings of immigrants predicted by the model with those obtained from the data. Figure 4 presents results for the case 
134~D6, D8~DV58~Derived Variable~Wealth Distribution~…in showing that selection of immigrants by wealth is allowed to play a role in accounting for non-trivial patterns, researchers assume that immigrants are randomly drawn from the bottom part of the wealth distribution for individuals in a given schooling bracket. Researchers consider several cases by right-censoring the wealth distribution at different percentiles, starting from the bottom 10% and gradually extending it to include more households.
134~D6, D10~DV58~Derived Variable~Wealth Distribution~Figure 4 indicates with a dot, for each country group, the amount of selection needed to account for the immigrants' earnings data for the economy with [epsilon] = .3. the earnings data for the first three country groups can be rationalized if immigrants are drawn from the bottom 20th, 30th, and 50th percent of the wealth distribution. Moreover, assuming that immigrants are drawn from the bottom 40% of the wealthdistribution accounts for the observed earnings ratio of 1.07 among immigrants born in countries in the 50th to 65th percentile group.
134~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Working Time of  the Child~…1 minus s (time spent in school by the child) is the working time of the children).
134~D5~V22~Variable~Years of Schooling~The parameter vector is calibrated so that in equilibrium the model economy matches an average years of schooling of 12.63, computed from CPS data for 1990.
134~D5~V22~Variable~Years of Schooling~Variance of ability ([sigma](z), mean and variance of schooling tastes (controlled by [theta](H) and [theta](L)), correlation of ability and schooling taste (controlled by b), and the time share [eta] - jointly determine the mean and variance of schooling, the R-squared and schooling coefficient in a Mincer regression and the intergenerational correlation of schooling.
134~D5~V22~Variable~Years of Schooling~Table 4 reports maximum attained school years by population percentiles obtained from CPS 1990 data and those generated by the model. The model slightly overpredicts educational attainments at the bottom of the distribution and underpredicts them at the top of the distribution.
134~D5~V22~Variable~Years of Schooling~Researchers note, however, that time in school is a continuous variable in our model, making its comparison with the data non-trivial. In particular, the distribution of schooling in the data has clear spikes at levels of education where an educational degree is completed.
134~D1, D5, D6~DV15~Derived Variable~Young Parent State~…the state of a young parent is given by a quadruple: resources (disposable income and assets) of the old parent, human capital of the young parent, child's ability, and child's taste for schooling.

135~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample contains nearly 900,000 women with approximately 540,000 reporting strictly positive weekly earnings; therefore 1050 state-year cells are generated with each cell containing on average a little more than 500 women with strictly positive earnings

135~D3~F6~Findings~On and Off Null Rejection on Employment, Hours, and Log Wages~…when the Monte Carlo study is ran for three different variables in the Current Population Survey, employment, hours, and change in log wages, ordinary least squares leads these researchers to reject the null of no effect at the 5% signficance level in less than 5% of the simulations.
135~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…exercises using the Current Population Survey data illustrate the severity of the problem in a commonly used dataset, however one might be concerned that these researchers have by chance detected actual laws or other relatively discreete change, or that there might be other features of the Current Population Survey wage data, such as state-specific time trends, that may also give rise to overrejection.

135~D1, D3~F9~Findings~DD Elasticity Estimation~…nearly 60% of signficant estimates in the differences-in-differences estimations fall in the 1% to 2 % range, whereas about 30% fall in the 2% to 3% range, and the remaining 10% are larger than 3%, estimates that large when considering that differences-in-differences estimates are often presented as elasticities.
135~D1, D3~D3~Dataset~Autoregressive(1)~…the researchers choose an autoregressive(1) process to illustrate the problems caused by autocorrelation in the context of a simple example, not because they think that such a process matches the female wage data the best.
135~D1, D3~F10~Findings~State Count and Null Rejection~…when factoring in for the fact that data sets used by many researchers have fewer than 50 groups, a quantity that is available when looking at state data included in the Current Population Survey, varying the number of states does not change the extent to which the null hypothesis is rejected in either of the Monte Carlo Simulations.
135~D1, D3~F11~Findings~Time Constriction and Null Rejection~…with only seven years of data, the rejection rate is 15% in the Current Population Survey based simulations suggesting that overrejection falls as the time span gets shorter, but does so at a rather rather slow rate.

135~D1, D3~M8~Methodology~Monte Carlo Simulation 2~…without correction for small sample bias, researchers first estimate the first-order autocorrelation coefficient of the residual by regressing the residual on its lag, and then use this estimated coefficient to form an estimate of the block-diagonal variance-covariance matrix of the residual.

135~D1, D3~F15~Findings~OLS and Autocorrelation Coefficients~…in the Current Population Survey data, ordinary least squares estimates a first-order autocorrelation coefficient of only 0.40, and in the autoregressive(1) model where the autocorrelation parameter is .8, a coefficient of .62 is estimated.
135~D1, D3~F16~Findings~First-Order Autocorrelation of 0.8 Null Rejection~…if the first-order autocorrelation of 0.8 is imposed in the current population survey, the rejection rate only goes down to 16%, a very partial improvement.
135~D1, D3~M9~Methodology~Monte Carlo Simulation 3~…first, data is generated according to an autoregressive(2) process with autocorrelation parameters 0.55 and 0.35, parameters that were chosen because they match well with the estimated first, second, and third autocorrelation parameters in the wage data when the formulas are applied to correct for small sample bias.
135~D1, D3~M9~Methodology~Monte Carlo Simulation 3~…second, the standard error is corrected assuming that the error term follows an autoregressive(2) process.

135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…a variant of bootstrap which maintains the autocorrelation structure by keeping all the observations that belong to the same group together.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…first, for each placebo intervention, the absolute t-statistic is computed using the ordinary least squares estimate of the coefficient and its standard error.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…second, a bootstrap sample is constructed by drawing with replacement 50 matrices, where Y bar, dependent on state, is the entire time series for that state, and V is the matrix of state dummies, time dummies, and treatment dummy for that same state.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…third, an ordinary least squares regression is run on this sample to obtain an estimate of the coefficient and construct the absolute t-statistic.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…the sampling distribution of the absolute t statistics is random and changing as the number of states grows.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…the difference between this distribution and the sampling distribution of t becomes small as the number of states goes to infinity, even in the presence of arbitrary autocorrelation within states and heteroskedasticity.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…researchers draw 200 boot strap samples and reject the hypothesis of no effect at a 95% confidence.
135~D1, D3~F19~Findings~Block Bootstrap Relevant Group Size Null Rejection~…when the number of groups is equal to 50, i.e. the number of states, the rejection rate of the null of no effect is 6.5% in data drawn from the Current Population Survey and 5% in data drawn from an autoregressive(1).
135~D1, D3~F20~Findings~Block Bootstrap Relevant Group Size 2% Rejection~…when the number of groups is equal to 50, i.e. the number of states, the rejection rate that there is a 2 percent effect is rejected in 26% of cases in the Current Population Survey data and in 25% of the cases in the autoregressive(1) data.
135~D1, D3~F21~Findings~Block Bootstrap Performance w/ Group Size Variation~…the block bootstrap performs less well when the number of states declines: the rejection rate is 13% with twenty states and 23% with ten states.
135~D1, D3~F22~Findings~Block Bootstrap Null Rejection In 2% Cases~…with twenty states, the null of no effect is rejected in only 19% of the cases when there is a 2% effect.
135~D1, D3~M12~Methodology~Ignore Time Series~…ignore the time-series information when computing standard errors by averaging the data before and after the law and run the basic differences-in-differences equation on this averaged outcome variable in a panel of length 2.
135~D1, D3~F23~Findings~Ignore Time Series Relevant Group Size Null Rejection~…when time series information is ignored and number of states is equal to 50, the rejection rate is equal to 5.3%.
135~D1, D3~M12~Methodology~Ignore Time Series~…this solution will work only for laws that are passed at the same time for all the treated states, because if laws are passed at different times, before and after are no long the same for each treated state and not even defined for the control states.
135~D1, D3~M13~Methodology~Modified Ignore Time Series~….one can slightly modify the technique when time series information is ignored to account for staggering law implementation by regressing the outcome on state fixed effects, year dummies, and any relevant covariates and then divide the residuals of the treatment states only into two groups: residuals from years before the laws, and residuals from years after the laws.
135~D1, D3~M13~Methodology~Modified Ignore Time Series~…the estimate of the laws' effect and its standard error can then be obtained from an ordinary least squares regression in this two-period panel.
135~D1, D3~M13~Methodology~Modified Ignore Time Series~…this procedure perfoms well as the simple aggregation for laws that are all passed at the same time and for laws that are staggered over time.
135~D1, D3~M13~Methodology~Modified Ignore Time Series~…when the number of states is small, the t-statistic needs to be adjusted to take into account the smaller number of observations.
135~D1, D3~F24~Findings~Modified Ignore Time Series Group Size Variation Null Rejection~"…when the ""Modified Ignore Time Series"" model is implemented for ten states, the rejection rate is 5.3% under the simple aggregation method and about 9% under the residual aggregation method."
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…implementing block bootstrap does require a limited amount of programming.
135~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Randomly Generated Intervention Variable~…to generate staggered laws, half of the states form the treatment group and a passage date is randomly chosen for each state separately.
135~D1~F25~Findings~Modified Ignore Time Series Group Size Variation 2% Rejection~"…the downside of the ""Modified Ignore Time Series"" procedure is seen in the Current Population Survey simulations with a 2 percent  effect, simple aggregation rejects the null only 16% of the time with 50 states, 8.8% of the time with 20 states, and 6.5% of the time with 10 states."
135~D1, D2, D3~M14~Methodology~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix~…supposing that the autocorrelation process is the same across all states and that there is no cross-sectional heteroskedasticity, if the data are sorted by states and years, the variance-covariance matrix of the error term is block diagonal, with 50 identical blocks of size time period by time period.
135~D1, D2, D3~M14~Methodology~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix~…the variation across the 50 states can be used to estimate each element of this matrix, and use this estimated matrix to compute standard errors.
135~D1, D2, D3~M14~Methodology~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix~…under the assumption that there is no heteroskedasticity, this method will produce consistent estimates of the standard error as the number of groups goes to infinity.
135~D1, D3~F26~Findings~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix Relevant Group Size Null Rejection~…the empirical variance-covariance matrix method performs well when the number of states is equal to 50 with the rejection rate equalling 5.5 percent in the Current Population Survey data and 7% in the Monte Carlo simulations.
135~D2~F27~Findings~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix Relevant Group Size 2% Rejection~…in the Monte Carlo study based on the empirical distribution of the Current Population Survey, the null of no effect is rejected in 24% of the simulations when there is a 2% effect.
135~D1, D2, D3~F28~Findings~Empirical Variance-Covariance Performance Specifications~…the empirical variance-covariance matrix method performs poorly for small sample sizes, as when the number of state drops, the rejection rate of the null of no effect increases: with ten states, this correction method leads researchers to reject the null of no effect in 8% of the cases, and with six states the rejection rate is 15%.
135~D1, D2, D3~M14~Methodology~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix~…limited in the sense that this method is only consistent under the assumption of cross-sectional homoskedasticity, an assumption that is likely to be violated in practice for many data sets.
135~D1, D2, D3~M15~Methodology~Arbitrary Variance-Covariance Matrix~…this estimator of the variance-covariance matrix is consistent for fixed panel length as the number of states moves toward infinity.
135~D1, D2, D3~F29~Findings~Arbitrary Variance-Covariance Matrix Relevant Group Size Null Rejection~…for the arbitrary variance-covariance matrix, the rejection rate in data drawn from the Current Population Survey is 6.3% when the number of states is equal to 50.
135~D1, D2, D3~F30~Findings~Arbitrary Variance-Covariance Matrix Relevant Group Size 2% Rejection Compared to Upper Bounds~…in accordance with previous findings in that with the correct covariance matrix the rejection rate in the cases of a 2% effect was 78% in a Monte Carlo Simulation with no autocorrelation and 32% in autoregressive(1) data with p = .8, the arbitrary variance-covraiance matrix comes near these upper bounds, achieving rejection rates of 74% and 27.5%, respectively.
135~D1, D2, D3~F31~Findings~Arbitrary Variance-Covariance Matrix Group Size Variation Rejection Rates~…rejection rates increase significantly above 5% when the number of states declines when using the arbitrary variance-covariance matrix method: 11.5% with six states and 8% with ten states.
135~D!, D2, D3~M15~Methodology~Arbitrary Variance-Covariance Matrix~…performs well in large sample, but not as well when the number of groups becomes small.
135~D1, D2, D3~M14~Methodology~Empirical Variance-Covariance Matrix~…performs well in large sample, but not as well when the number of groups becomes small.
135~D1, D3~M11~Methodology~Block Bootstrap~…can be used to compute consistent standard errors when the number of groups is sufficiently large.
136~136: Human Capital Dynamics and the U.S. Labor Market~~~~
136~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
136~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Main Finding 1~…once workers have accounted for and are able to optimally respond to possible human capital loss, the unemployment rate in an economy with human capital loss during unemployment will not be higher than in an economy with no human capital loss. The reason is that the increase in the unemployment rate led by human capital loss is more than offset by workers' endogenous responses to prevent them from being unemployed.
136~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Main Finding 2~…human capital accumulation on the job is more important than human capital loss during unemployment for both the unemployment rate and output.
136~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~Main Finding 3~…workers' endogenous separation rates will decline when job finding rates fall. Quantitatively, the decline in the job finding rates in the 2008-2012 period caused the endogenous separation rates to decline by almost 1 percentage point in the same period.
136~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Main Finding 4~…taking into account the endogenous responses, UI extensions contributed 0.5 percentage point to the increase in the aggregate unemployment rate in the 2008 to 2012 period.
136~D2~V1~Variable~Unemployment Rate~…researchers in the aggregate generally agree that the persistence in the high unemployment rate througout the period during and after the Great Recession is due to the persistently low unemployment-to-employment transition rate. What is less agreed upon is whether this low job finding rate is mainly due to factors leading to weak demand for labor (literally, there are fewer job opportunities in the economy) or factors that influence the supply side, such as skill deterioration, a decline in job-search intensity, and extensions of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…in this paper, researchers construct and estimate a Mortensen-Pissarides style labor-market matching model with endogenous separation decisions and stochastic changes in workers' human capital.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to quantitatively investigate the points of interest to this research, micro data is used to estimate the model to match the labor market dynamics and wage moments for different educational groups in the 2003 to 2007 period. Researchers then conduct a series of experiments to study how agents' endogenous choices vary with changes in the exogneous shocks and changes in labor-market policy in the context of human capital dynamics.

136~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~U-E Transition Rate~…the unemployment-to-employment transition rate.
136~D1, D2~F6~Findings~E-U and U-E Transtion Rates and Education Level~…during the Great Recession, the E-U transition rate increased significantly for each educational group, and the increase was more dramatic for no-college graduates, while the unemployment-to-employment transition rate dropped from 50% to 20% and stayed low, but there was no significant difference between educational groups.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…source of data on experience, unemployment status and wage differentials between various groups.
136~D1~F7~Findings~Employment Status and Wage Fluctuations I~…using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, researchers find that unemployed workers on average experience 4% to 5% of wage loss and employed workers on average experience 2% to 3% of wage increase in a year.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…motivated by preliminary observations, researchers develop a model with human capital dynamics to study the aggregate and disaggregate (by education level) labor market dynamics in the Great Recession.
136~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Education Level~…in the relevant model, the economy is populated by a continuum of agents with varying education levels.
136~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Employment Status~…in the relevant model, the economy is populated by a continuum of agents with different education levels who may either be employed or unemployed.
136~V4~L1~Variable Value~Employed~…when employed, workers can accumulate specific human capital.
136~V4~L2~Variable Value~Unemployed~…when unemployed, workers may lose some of their specific human capital.
136~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Job Market~…job markets are segmented by education.
136~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Job Market~…firms can choose to post vacancies in different markets.
136~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Vacancies~…firms can choose to post vacancies in different markets.

136~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Productivity~…a matched worker-and-job pair draws a match-specific productivity, and the productivity evolves over a match's life.
136~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Productivity~…the production value depends on both education and the specific human capital.
136~D1, D2~V2~Variable~UI Benefits~…unemployed workers may be entitled to Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits based on their past employment histories.
136~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…wages are determined by generalized Nash bargaining.

136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…researchers estimate the steady state of the relevant model to match the pre-crisis period labor market statistics using data from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…researchers estimate the steady state of the relevant model to match the pre-crisis period labor market statistics using data from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Then, the estimated economy is simulated to match the labor market dynamics in the Great Recession taking into account the productivity shock, exogenous separation shock, matching efficiency shock and the extensions of UI benefits.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…in addition to modeling human capital accumulation, the authors also model human capital loss during an unemployment spell. Hence their treatment of human capital dynamics is richer and can account for both wage loss and wage growth.
136~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…labor market statistics are investigated using the Current Population Survey (CPS).
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…wage moments are explored using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
136~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…authors use monthly data from the CPS to construct unemployment rate and transition rates between employment and unemployment.
136~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS has four rotation groups every month. Each group is in the survey for four months, out for eight months, and in again for another four months. Hence, roughly there are three-quarters of the households are surveyed in the two consecutive months. Researchers use these observations to construct the monthly transition rates between employment and unemployment.
136~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data sample is restricted to include individuals aged between 25 and 60. The lower bound is chosen because most people have completed their education by age 25. The upper bound is chosen to exclude individuals who are close to the retirement age since these individual's labor market behavior may be different from the younger groups.
136~D1, D2~V8~Variable~Age~…the sample is restricted to be individuals aged between 25 and 60.
136~V8~L3~Variable Value~25.0~…this lower bound is chosen because most people have completed their education by age 25.
136~V8~L4~Variable Value~60.0~…this upper bound is chosen to exclude individuals who are close to the retirement age since these individuals' labor market behavior may be different from the younger groups.
136~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers apply the continuous time correction for time aggregation bias developed by Shimer (2012) to each education group. This correction takes into account that some workers who become unemployed managed to find a new job before the next CPS survey arrived.
136~D2~T1~Time Period~2003-2007~…survey period from which Current Population Survey data is drawn on pre-Recession economic standing.
136~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Education Level~…researchers apply the continuous time correction for time aggregation bias developed by Shimer (2012) to each CPS education group. This correction takes into account that some workers who become unemployed managed to find a new job before the next CPS survey arrived.
136~D2~V1~Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the United States unemployment rate was roughly 5% in 2007 and then rose sharply after 2007 and peaked around 10% in early 2010 and decreased slowly since then. Meanwhile the long-term unemployment rate more than doubled after 2007.
136~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Education Level~…to parameterize the model, the data is aggregated into two education groups.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to simplify the computation, the authors restrict the proposed model to two education groups. To parameterize the model, the data is aggregated into two education groups.
136~V3~L5~Variable Value~Less Than College~…one of two aggregated education groups.
136~V3~L6~Variable Value~College and Above~…one of two aggregated education groups.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…this data source is a national representative panel that surveys each individual every four month but records labor market status, wage and other labor information for each month. The SIPP also contains demographic information.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…the panel normally lasts 3 to 4 years since 1996 but lasts shorter before 1996.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…the high-frequency and longitudinal features of the SIPP make the relevant analysis feasible because unemployment is a short-lived situation for most individuals, information at the monthly frequency is essential for comparing wages before and after unemployment.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…for the relevant analysis, researchers use the most recent 6 panels before the Great Recession. The authors choose to exclude the panel that starts in 2008 because they will eventually parameterize the wage loss and wage growth in the steady state of the model using estimates obtained from SIPP before the Great Recession. More than one panel is included to increase the number of observations. Panels start at 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, and 2004.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…individuals aged between 25 and 60 are selected for the same reason as the selections made from the CPS data.
136~D1~T2~Time Period~1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2004~…relevant panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation used to draw data on wages and other labor market information before the Great Recession.
136~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…measurement errors in hours and unrecorded overtime work that plague total earnings responses in the SIPP often contaminate wages computed for salaried workers. Hence researchers focus on hourly paid workers only. The hourly paid workers consist roughly half of all workers. The authors use the real wage data by deflating the nominal wage by monthly CPI.
136~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…for the purpose of exploring the change in human capital, it is important to have a precise measure for the price of labor. Measurement errors in hours and unrecorded overtime work that plague total earnings responses in the SIPP often contaminate wages computed for salaried workers. Hence, the focus is places on hourly paid workers only. The hourly paid workers consist roughly half of all workers. The real wage data is used by deflating the nominal wage by monthly CPI.
136~D1, D2~V9~Variable~EUE~…to analyze the wage loss on unemployment, authors select the episode in which an individual moved from employment to unemployment and to employment again (EUE) with at least one reported month as unemployed.

136~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…a secondary specification of this regression is run with the length of employment as a regressor to analyze the wage growth on employment. In this regression, the output is the real log wage change between the first and last wage on an employment spell. If the observation is employed at the beginning of the panel, the first wage is the first observed wage and if the observation is employed at the end of the panel, the last wage is the last observed wage.
136~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…in a secondary specification of the log linear model where the log real wage change is the wage change between the first and last wage on an employment spell. If the observation is employed at the beginning of the panel, the first wage is the first observed wage and if the observation is employed at the end of the panel, the last wage is the last observed wage.
136~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Log Real Wage Change~…in a secondary specification of the log linear model where the log real wage change is the wage change between the first and last wage on an employment spell. If the observation is employed at the beginning of the panel, the first wage is the first observed wage and if the observation is employed at the end of the panel, the last wage is the last observed wage.
136~D1~F8~Findings~Employment Status and Wage Fluctuations II~…the regression results from the second specification of the log linear model provide evidence that wages decline after unemployment and wages grow on employment. In particular, wage declines by about 4% a year and grows by about 3% a year. The more educated group has slightly larger wage changes both on unemployment and on employment.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…the model assumes that there is an economy populated by infinite number of workers who differ in human capital levels.
136~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Productivity~…the model assumes that there is an economy populated by an infinite number of firms which differ in their idiosyncratic productivity.

136~D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Working Requirements~…unemployed who are not entitled with UI benefits have to work, on average, the inverse of the benefit qualification probability before they are eligible to receive UI benefits.
136~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Benefit Qualification Probability~…this probability will be calibrated to match the actual working requirement in the United States economy.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…workers' human capital consists of two parts, the general human capital and the specific human capital.
136~DV2~L16~Variable Value~General Human Capital~…a worker's degree of education can be though as one kind of general human capital. It does not change with job tenure or the firm the worker works for.
136~DV2~L17~Variable Value~Specific Human Capital~…the specific human capital is the skill related to the job the worker has. The longer a worker works on a job, the more likely the worker will become more familiar with the job and thus the specific human capital accumulates.
136~DV2~L16~Variable Value~General Human Capital~…it is reasonable to assume the general human capital complements the specific human capital as a worker who has more education may learn things faster than a worker receives less education.
136~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Importance of General Capital~…measures the importance of general human capital in determining total human capital.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…the total human capital is jointly determined by the two types of human capital through a simple function with general human capital raised to the importance factor multiplied by the specific human capital raised to 1 minus the importance factor.
136~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Education Level~…the subscript g is used to denote education.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…an important feature of the model is that workers' human capital varies (stochastically) with the labor market status. It improves during the employment period, while depreciates at the layoff time and during unemployed periods.

136~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Benefit Qualification Probability~…at the beginning of a period, the retirement shock realizes. It is at this point that the employed worker with UI benefits qualifies for the UI benefits with this probability measure.
136~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Break Up Rate~…at the beginning of a period, the retirement shock realizes. The new matches are then formed and the old matches are destroyed at this exogneous rate.

136~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Matched Worker-and-Job Pair~…if both the firm and the worker agree to form the match, the firm borrows the wage and repays it after production takes place.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…the evolution of human capital happens after the meeting of workers and vacancies but before the match decision.
136~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Worker Meet Rate~…the meeting probability depends on last period's rather than the current period's human capital level.
136~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Vacancy Meet Rate~…the meeting probability depends on last period's rather than the current period's human capital level.
136~D1, D2~V2~Variable~UI Benefits~…the UI pays a fraction of the average wage in the worker's skill category when last employed. Hence, to calculate benefit it is sufficient to keep track of a worker's human capital level when last employed.

136~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Aggregate Productivity Shock~…researchers assume that the aggregate shock does not change in the benchmark model which corresponds to the pre-crisis period. The authors do however allow it to vary in the simulation part.

136~D2~V13~Variable~Social Welfare Benefits~…in this economy, the government collects income tax and firing tax from the firms and uses the revenues to provide UI benefits provided to unemployed workers (who are qualified) and the social welfare assistance to unemployed workers who are not qualified for receiving UI benefits.

136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to circumvent the computational difficulty of the optimization problem with nonsmooth and local optima, researchers apply a recent approach proposed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2005). They develop a class of Laplace Type Estimators which can be implemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…in total, there are 18 parameters in the model: 3 parameters on the levels of human capital, 6 parameters on the human capital transitional probabilities, 5 parameters on the processes of idiosyncratic productivity, and 4 parameters on the matching efficiency and vacancy-posting cost.

136~D1, D2~DV31~Derived Variable~Experience Wage Differential~…one of three wage ratios used to help identify the 3 parameters on human capital levels.
136~D1, D2~DV32~Derived Variable~25 Year Old Education Wage Differential~…one of three wage ratios used to help identify the 3 parameters on human capital levels.
136~D1, D2~DV33~Derived Variable~Human Capital Accumulation Rate~…wage changes conditional on employment and unemployment experience are used to identify the human capital accumulation rate.

136~D1, D2~V22~Variable~Vacancy Costs-to-GDP ratio~…this ratio is set to be 4%, which is in the range of values used in the literature.
136~D1, D2, D3~F9~Findings~Unemployment and Human Capital Depreciation Across Education Levels~…during unemployment periods, the depreciation of human capital for highly-educated workers is almost zero, while for low-educated workers, the estimated skill depreciation rate during periods of unemployment is 1.44% per month, which suggests an 8% loss of human capital per month.
136~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Human Capital Accumulation and Education~…the human capital accumulation rate is a little bit higher for highly-educated workers than for low-educated workers. This seems to suggest some complementarity between education and specific human capital, meaning that highly-educated workers may be able to learn relevant skills on the job faster than low-educated workers.
136~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Human Capital~…the transitional dynamics between 2008 and 2012 are driven by three shocks: TFP shocks, shocks to exogenous separation rates, and shocks to matching efficiency.
136~D1, D2~DV38~Derived Variable~TFP Shocks~…quarterly TFP series are constructed using the standard approach in the literature.
136~D1, D2~DV39~Derived Variable~Matching Efficiency~…the matching efficiency rate series is chosen to match the E-U transitional rates and U-E transitional rates for the two educational groups.
136~D1, D2~DV37~Derived Variable~Exogenous Separation Rate~…the exogneous separation rates series is chosen to match the E-U transitional rates and U-E transitional rates for the two educational groups.
136~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~2008-2012~…during the 2008 to 2012 period, UI benefits were extended multiple times. This leads to an increase in the maximum weeks of UI benefits from 26 to 99.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to quantify the effects of the 2008 to 2010 UI extensions, researchers compare the transitional dynamics without UI extensions to those with actual UI extensions. The dynamics with UI extensions are considered the benchmark transtional dynamics. The transitional dynamics without UI extensions were generated by simulating the model under the assumption that the UI benefit policy was unchanged int the period of 2008 to 2012.
136~D1, D2~F11~Findings~UI Extensions and the Aggregate Unemployment Rate~…the contribution of UI extensions to the increase in the aggregate unemployment rate is about 0.5 percentage point. More precisely, without UI extensions, the unemployment rate during the 2010 to 2012 period would have been 0.5 percentage point lower than the actual level.
136~D1, D2~F12~Findings~UI Extensions and Eduction Level~…the UI extensions had a larger impact on the high-educational group than on the low-educational group. This is because highly-educated workers are more afraid of losing UI benefits because the transition from UI to SA represents a larger loss to highly-educated workers than to low-educated workers. Therefore, highly-educated workers have more incentives to leave unemployment, before thier UI benefits run out. Correspondingly, when UI benefits were extended, highly-educated workers became more relaxed and more patient in selecting jobs. As a result, the job finding rates (U-E transitional rates) declined more for highly-educated workers than for low-educated workers. This led the unemployment rate for the high-educational group to increase more than that for the low-educational group.
136~D1, D2~V2~Variable~UI Benefits~…highly-educated workers are more afraid of losing UI benefits because the transition from UI to SA represents a larger loss to highly-educated workers than to low-educated workers. Therefore, highly-educated workers have more incentives to leave unemployment before their UI benefits run out. 
136~D1, D2~F13~Findings~UI Extensions and Economic Output~…the UI benefit extension lowered output by about 0.35% in each year in the 2010 to 2012 period. This is a result of two effects. First, as the unemployment rate increased by 0.41 percentage point, fewer people were working after UI benefits were extended, which lowered total output. Second, UI extensions slightly increased the labor productivity, by an average annual rate of 0.13% in the period of 2010 to 2012. The increase in the labor productivity is due to the fact that benefit extensions allowed unemployed workers to be more patient in selecting jobs, which icnreased average productivity.
136~D1, D2~V2~Variable~UI Benefits~…all UI extensions took place between July 2008 and July 2010.
136~D1, D2~T4~Time Period~2008-2010~…all UI extensions took place between July 2008 and July 2010.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the model can also be used to quantify the effects of changes in TFP in the period of 2008-2012. This is done by comparing the transitional dynamics in the benchmark case with the simulated paths assuming no changes in TFP levels.
136~D1, D2~DV38~Derived Variable~TFP Shocks~…TFP declined by about 5% through 2008 and the first half of 2009 before it started to increase in later years. 
136~D1, D2~F14~Findings~TFP Shocks and the Unemployment Rate~…compared to the benchmark, the decline in TFP in the first two years caused the unemployment rate to increase by an average of 0.13 percentage point and 0.12 percentage point in 2009 and 2010, respectively, while the improvement in TFP in the following years reduced the unemployment rate by an average of 0.11 percentage point in 2012.
136~D1, D2~DV38~Derived Variable~TFP Shocks~…TFP affects the unemployment rate mainly by influencing the job findng rates. This is because a decline in TFP reduces the matching surplus and thus reduces the vacancies posted. Fewer vacancies lead to a lower probability for an unemployed worker to meet with a firm and result in a lower job finding rate.
136~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Vacancies~…fewer vacancies lead to a lower probability for an unemployed worker to meet with a firm and result in a lower job finding rate.
136~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Mathing Efficiency and Job Finding Rates~…the decline in matching efficiency after 2008 caused the negative difference in the job finding rate in the 2010 to 2011 period to reach 22 percentage points and 15 percentage points for the low-educational group and the high-educational group, respectively. The differences slightly diminished in 2012 to 19 percentage points and 13 percentage points, respectively.
136~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~E-U Transition Rate~…intuitively, when there are fewer job opportunities in the economy, workers should be less willing to separate. Thus, the endogenous separation rate should fall.
136~D1, D2, D3~F16~Findings~Separation Rates During the Great Recession~…the separation rate declined by almost 1 percentage point during the 2008 to 2012 period, with the decline being larger in the first two years than in late years.
136~DV2~L17~Variable Value~Specific Human Capital~…on average, low-educated workers accumulate less specific human capital and thus have less to lose than high-educated workers.
136~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Human Capital Accumulation by Education and Productivity~…as the estimation result indicates, the human capital accumulation rate is lower for low-educated workers, which implies that low-educated workers have larger incentives to look for new jobs with higher idiosyncratic productivity.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the authors also quantify the effects of changes in exogenous separation rates on the unemployment rate and other macroeconomic variables. This is achieved by simulating the transitional paths under the assumption that there were no changes in exogenous separation rates and comparing them with the benchmark transitional paths.
136~D1, D2~DV37~Derived Variable~Exogenous Separation Rate~…in the current model, an increase in the exogenous separation rate may influence the job finding rate through two channels. First it reduces the market tightness and thus lowers the probaiblity for an unemployed worker to meet with a firm. Second, it may change the skill distribution (i.e., the ratio of high-skilled workers to low-skilled workers) in the pool of unemployed workers, which may influence the aggregate job finding rate.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to quantify the effects of human capital loss (which includes both the initial loss and the following human capital depreciation), researchers have simulated the transitional dynamics under the assumption that there was no human capital loss.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the authors conduct an experiment in which workers' decision rules are based on the actual human capital transitional dynamics while researchers assume no human capital depreciation actually occurred in the transitional paths. In other words, the decision rule is the same as in the benchmark case, while in the simulation, researchers shut off the actual human capital depreciation. By comparing the outcome in this simulation with the outcome in the benchmarke case, the pure effect of human capital depreciation is isolated. 
136~D1, D2, D3~F18~Findings~Pure Effect of Human Capital Depreciation~…the results show that the pure effect of human capital depreciation on increasing the unemployment rate is only about 0.8 percentage point in the 2010 to 2012 period. Furthermore, this is completely dirven by the increase in the unemployment rate for the low-educational group.
136~D1, D2~F19~Findings~Unemployment Rate Fluctuations Without Human Capital Accumulation~…without human capital accumulation on the job, the unemployment rate will increase by an average of 0.7 percentage point per year in the 2008 to 2012 period.
136~D1, D2~F20~Findings~Unemployment Rate Flucations and Education~…the increase in the unemployment rate is mainly driven by the increase in the unemployment rate for the high-educational group. This increase in the unemployment rate was a result of an increase in the separation rate and a decline in the job finding rate. The separation rate increased because there were no opportunities for workers to improve human capital which caused workers and firms to be more willing to separated. The decline in the job finding rate is because workers had less incentive to take a job as they cannot improve their skills on the job.
136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…a Mortensen-Pissarides style labor-market matching model with endogenous separation decisions and stochastic changes in workers' human capital. The model parameters are estimated to match the labor market dynamics and wage moments for different educational groups.

136~D2~V1~Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the unemployment rate is calculated as unemployed/(employed+unemployed) for each education group.
136~V1~L35~Variable Value~Short-Term Unemployed~…to calculate the number of short-term unemployed, the authors follow Shimer (2012) to eliminate the discontinuity associated with the redesign of the CPS in 21994. Specifically, the authors measure the short-term unemployed from the full sample before 1994. Researchers use only the incoming rotation groups from 1994 onwards. For the later period, researchers use the CPS data to construct the fraction of short-term unemployed among all unemployed workers for the incoming rotation groups in each month since 1976. Researchers seasonally adjust this series using the Census's X-12-ARIMA algorithm, and then use the product of the number of unemployed workers in the full CPS and the short-term unemployment share as their measurement for the short term unemployed from 1994 onwards.

136~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to implement the GMM LTE estimation, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to simulate the quasi-posterior distribution. Then the parameter estimator is given the smaple mean of this simulated distribution. The procedure is as follows: 1.) Sart with an initial parameter vector. Solve the structural model and construct the moments based on the generated stationary distribution. 2.) Use the simulated moments and data moments to form the GMM objective function. 3.) Apply the Metroploise-Hastings algorithm to generate 120,000 draws. 4.) The parameter estimator is the mean of the last 100,000 simulated draws.

137~D2~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the constructed hourly wage sample was restricted to contain only those workers who also reported an hourly wage, hence any difference between the two columns reflects only differences in the measurement of the hourly wage, rather than sample differences.

137~D1~F14~Findings~% Winsorizing Rule Caution~…small increments to the percentage winsorizing rule (e.g., to 5%) can dramatically increase bias and render the cleaning undesirable on mean squared error grounds.
138~138: Identification and Robustness with Contaminated and Corrupted Data~~~~
138~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~"…the main assumption in this research is that the analyst can place an upper bound on the probability of a data error. This assumption is implicit in all robust estimation. Bounded-influence estimation assumes that the probability of a data error is ""small"" (technically, it is infinitesimal), and high-breakdown estimation assumes implicitly that the error probability is less than the breakdown point."
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…in some applications, the probability of a data error can be estimated from a validation data set. In other applications, data errors arise out of the efforts of analysts to impute missing values; the fraction of imputed values then provides an estimate of an upper bound on the error probability. There are, of course, many applications in which there is no obvious way to set a firm upper bound on the probability of a data error. in these cases, it is still of interest to determine how inference on population parameters degades as the error probability increases. This can be done by varying the upper bound on the probability of a data error over a plausible range and observing the resulting changes in the bounds on the parameters of interest.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~"…the current research analyses identification under two error models prominent in robust estimation. The ""contaminated sampling"" model assumes that data errors are statistically independent of sample realizations from the population of interest. The more general ""corrupted sampling"" model does not impose this assumption. The contaminated sampling model is maintained in the part of the robustness literature concerned with bounded-influence estimation. The corrupted sampling model is used in studies of high-breakdown estimation."
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~"…econometrics has long been concerned with a third error model, the ""errors-in-variables"" model, which assumes that erroneous observations are generated by adding mean-zero errors to sample realizations from the population of interest."
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…to pose the problem of data errors that is investigated, suppose that one wants to make an inference about the marginal distribution of a random variable y(1). However, one does not observe that variable y(1) but a random variable y whose realized value can that of either y (1) or (with nonzero probability) another random variable, y(0), whose distribution is unkown.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…a random sample is drawn from a random triple distributed P, (y(0), y(1), z) within a measurable space.
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…the objective is to make an inference about the marginal distribution of y, but one does not observe sample realizations of any components of (y(0), y(1), z). One observes only realizations of y = y(0)(1-z) + y(1)z. Since interest centers on y(1), realizations of y corresponding to z = 0 constitute data errors. Realizations of y corresponding to z = 1 are error free.
138~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income~…denotes the distribution of the observable y.
138~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Interest~…denotes the marginal distribution of the random variable of interest.
138~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income for Noncompleters~…denotes the distribution of y(1) conditional on an event.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…in robust estimation, the unknown marginal distribution is held fixed and the distribution of the observables is allowed to range over all distributions. The objective is to characterize the maximum possible difference between the distribution of observables, which can be estimated consistently, and the marginal distribution, which cannot be estimated consistently because it is not identified.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…in identification analysis, the observable distribution is held fixed because it is identified by the data, and the marginal distribution is allowed to range over all distributions. The objective is to set bounds on the unknown quantity of the marginal distribution.
138~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income~…in identification analysis, the observable distribution is held fixed because it is identified by the data.
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…a random triple distribution.
138~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Interest~…in identification analysis, the marginal distribution is allowed to range over all distributions.
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…a piece of prior information that is frequently assumes to be available in robust estimation is that the occurrence of data errors is independent of the sample realizations from the population of interest.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…a piece of prior information that is frequently assumes to be available in robust estimation is that the occurrence of data errors is independent of the sample realizations from the population of interest. In which case inferences about the marginal distribution P(1) are equivalent to inferences about the marginal distribution P(11). This assumption underlies the influence function and bounded-influence estimation. Accordingly, this paper provides parallel treatment of the problem in which this assumption does and does not hold. Results when it does hold are formulated in terms of bounds on P(11) and functionals of P(11) since P(11) and P(1) are the same. Results when the assumption does not hold are formulated in terms of bounds on P(1) and functionals of P(11).
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~"…following common terminology, researchers refer to the case where the assumption that P(1) equals P(11) holds as the ""contaminated sampling model. In turn, researchers refer to the case where this assumption does not hold as the ""corrupted sampling"" model. This case, which permits arbitrary corruptiond used by HRRS in their defintion of the finite-sample breakdown point is a finite-sample version of the current researchers' corrupted sampling model."
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…one useful piece of prior information is an upper bound on the probability that a data point is erroneous. The analysis assumes that one knows or can estimate a bound such that the probability is less than or equal to the bound which is less than 1.
138~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Interest~…tighter bounds on P(1) can be established under the contaminated sampling model than under the corrupted sampling model.
138~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Break Down Point~…in robust estimation, the breakdown point of a functional can be defined as the largest fraction of erroneous data that the functional can tolerate without being driven to either boundary of its range.
138~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Break Down Point~…Donoho and Huber (1993), referred to herinafter as DH, define the breakdown point as the smallest fraction of erroneous data that can drive the function to a boundary of its range. As noted by HRRS, their definition and that of DH differ by 1/n in a sample of size n. The current analysis could be based on either definition. Researchers adopt that of HRRS to avoid ambiguity.
138~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Break Down Point~…when Y is a finite-dimensional real space, the identification breakdown point under the corrupted sampling model is a limiting form of the HRRS version of the finite-sample breakdown point of robust estimation.
138~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Break Down Point~…note that the identification breakdown point is evaluated at the observed distribution whereas the breakdown point in robust estimation is evaluated at the distribution of interest. This difference between the identification and robust-estimation breakdown points reflects the focus on identification analysis on ex post inference, whereas robust estimation is concerned with ex ante analysis on the behavior of estimators.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…the difference between the identification and robust-estimation breakdown points reflects the focus on identification analysis on ex post inference, whereas robust estimation is concerned with ex ante analysis on the behavior of estimators.
138~D1~F1~Findings~Observed Distributional Bounds Under Contamination~…let the observed distribution be the standard normal and let the breakdown point be 0.1. Researchers find bounds on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of y(1) under contamination and corruption. It is observed that under contamination, but not corruption, the width of the bounds approaches 0 as t goes toward negative or positive infinity. Also observe that the lower bounds are uninformative if t is less than or equal to -1.28 and the upper bounds are uninformative if t is greater than or equal to 1.28. This reflects the identification breakdown point of the probability function.
138~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Break Down Point~…if the breakdown point is fixed, the bounds increase as a increases. Hence, the bounds shift to the right as the a-quantiles increase.
138~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to illustrate estimation of the bounds, researchers consider data on the income distribution in the U.S. The data are based on household interviews obtained in the Current Population Survey (CPS) and are published by the U.S. Burea of the Census (the Bureau) in Series P-60 of Current Population Reports.
138~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…two sampling problems identified by the Bureau are ""interview nonresponse,"" wherein some households in the CPS, sampling frame are not interviewed, and ""item nonresponse,"" wherein some of those interviewed do not provide complete income responses."
138~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the U.S. Bureau of the Census states that in the March 1990 CPS, which provides data on incomes during 1989, approximately 4.5% of the 60,000 households in the sampling frame were not interviewed and that incomplete income data were obtained from approximately 8% of the persons in interviewed households. Faced with these nonresponse problems, the Bureau uses available information to impute missing income data. The Bureau mixes actual and imputed data to produce the household income statistics reported in its Series P-60 publications.
138~D1~V1~Variable~Income~…from the perspective of this paper, y(1) is the income a CPS household respondent would report if it were to complete the survey, y(0) is the income the Bureau would impute to the household if the household were not to complete the survey.
138~D1~V2~Variable~Survey Completion~…from the perspective of this paper, z is equal to 1 if a household completes the survey.
138~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income for Noncompleters~…the distribution of income reported by those CPS households who do not complete the survey is P(11).
138~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income~…the distribution of household income found in the Series P-60 publications is Q = (1-p)P(11) + pP(00), where p is the probability that a CPS household does not complete the survey and P(00) is the distribution of incomes imputed by the Bureau to those households who do not complete the survey.
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…p is the probability that a CPS household does not complete the survey.
138~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Distribution of Imputed Incomes~…P(00) is the distribution of incomes imputed by the Bureau to those households who do not complete the survey.
138~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Interest~…the distribution of interest is P(1) = (1-p) P(11) + pP(10), where P(10) is the (latent) distribution of incomes that would have been reported by CPS households who did not complete the survey, had they done so.
138~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Latent Distribution of Income~..the latent distribution of incomes that would have been reported by CPS households who did not complete the survey, had they done so.
138~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Interest~"…the researchers' reference to P(1) as the ""distribution of interest"" does not imply that P(1) is necessarily the distribution an applied researcher would wish to learn. Applied researchers are typically interested in the distribution of actual income, not the distribution of reported income. The two distributions may differ if some households misreport their incomes. Misreporting although an important sampling problem, will not be addressed here."
138~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Bureau's imputation practice is valid if P(10) is equal to P(00), implying that P(1) = Q. The main concern of the researchers, however, is with the worst-case situation in which one has no prior information about the relation between P(00) and P(10). Researchers can compute the bound estimates given at the beginning of the section if they have consistent estimates of ! and of an upper bound on P. Bureau publications provide both quantities. Researchers focus on the distribution of household income in 1989.
138~D1~T1~Time Period~1989.0~…researchers focus on the distribution of household income in 1989 represented by the 1990 survey year of the Current Population Survey.
138~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Probability of Noncompletion~…as has been noted, U.S. Bureau of the Census reports that 4.5% of the CPS households were not interviewed and 8% of the persons in interviewed households did not provide complete income responses. The Bureau's publication does not report how the latter group are spread across households but researchers can be sure that no more than 7.6% (i.e. 8% X .955) of the households have item nonresponse. So 12.1% (i.e. 4.5% + 7.6%) consistently estimates an upper bound on p.

Researchers have Q[0,30) = 0.515 and the probability bound equal to 0.121. Hence, the estimated bounds on P(11)[0,30) are [0.448, 0.586] and the estimated bounds on P(1)[0,30) are [0.394, 0.636].
138~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income for Noncompleters~…the median of P(11) must lie between the 0.5(1 - bound) and 0.5 (1 - bound) + bound quantiles of Q.
138~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Interest~…the median of P(1) must lie between the 0.5 - bound and 0.5 + bound quantiles of Q.
138~D1~F3~Findings~q(11) and q(1) Bounds Assuming that Q is Uniform Within $5,000 Intervals~…replacing Q and bound by Q(n) and bound(n), and invoking the auxiliary assumption that Q is uniform within $5000 intervals, the estimated bounds on q(11)(.5) are [22.482, 33.026], and the estimated bounds on q(1)(.5) are [21.954, 37.273].
138~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income for Noncompleters~…P(11) is dominated by Q (i.e. sets of zero ! Measure also have zero P(11) measure).
138~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Measurable Space~…in the main analysis, the measureable space assumes that Y is the extended real line and omega consists of the Lebesgue measurable sets.
138~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Measurable Space~…the measurable space is denoted by (Y, omega).
138~DV5~L22~Variable Value~Identification Break Down Point~…if a is fixed and the break down point increases from 0 to 1, the smallest set of possible values of q(11)(a) widens from the a-quantile of Q to the smallest interval enclosing the support of Q. The bound is informative both above and below for all a between 0 and 1, all Q, and all break down pooints less than 1. Therefore, the identification breakdown point of q(11)(a) is always 1.
138~DV5~L22~Variable Value~Identification Break Down Point~…the bounds on q(1)(a) also shift to the right as a increases for fixed break down points. If a remains fixed and the break down point increase from 0 to 1, the set of possible values of q(1)(a) widens from the a-quantile of Q to [-oo, oo]. The lower bound is informative if the breakdown point is less than a, and the upper bound is informative if the breakdown point is less than 1 minus a. Therefore, the identification breakdown point of q(1)(a) is min(a, 1 - a).
138~D1~F4~Findings~Observed Distributional Bounds Under Contamination and Corruption~…let the observed distribution, Q, be the standard normal, and let the break down point be equal to 0.1. Researchers find bounds on the quartile function of y(1) under contamination and corruption. Let 0 < a < 1. Observe that the lower bound on q(1)(a) is uninformative if a is less than or equal to 0.1 and the upper bound is uninformative if a is greater than or equal to 0.9. This reflects the identification breakdown points of the quantile function under corruption.
138~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Measurable Space~…the function respects stochastic dominance amongst the F and G distributions on the measurable space.
138~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income~…the resulting range of values is finite if the mean of Q is finite.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…robust estimation supposes that Q is not yet known and, holding P(11) fixed, obtains the feasible values of the mean of Q.
138~D1~F5~Findings~Expected Value of y(1) Bounds Under Contamination~…let the observed distribution, Q, be the standard normal and let the break down point be equal to 0.1. Researchers find bounds on the expected value of y(1) under contamination. Observe that the lower bound is equal to 1 if t is greater than or equal to 1.282 and the upper bound is equal to 0 if t is less than or equal to -1.282. Therefore, -0.194 is less than or equal to the expected value of y(1) which is less than or equal to the expected value of 0.194 under contamination.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…in robust estimation under contaminated sampling, the unknown distribution P(11) is held fixed.
138~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Distribution of Income for Noncompleters~…in robust estimation under contaminated sampling, the unknown distribution P(11) is held fixed.
138~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Gross-Error Sensitivity~…the gross-error sensitivity of the functional at P(11).
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~"…in identification analysis as in robust estimation, the gross-error sensitivity governs the maximum possible values of the differences between the function of Q minus the functional of P(11) under the contamination model with infinitesimal contamination probability. However, in identification analysis, the gross error sensitivity is evaluated at the observed distribution Q, not the unkown ""correct"" distribution P(11). Like the difference between the identification and robust-estimation breakdown points, this reflects the focus of identification analysis on ex post inference."
138~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Gross-Error Sensitivity~"…in identification analysis as in robust estimation, the gross-error sensitivity governs the maximum possible values of the differences between the function of Q minus the functional of P(11) under the contamination model with infinitesimal contamination probability. However, in identification analysis, the gross error sensitivity is evaluated at the observed distribution Q, not the unkown ""correct"" distribution P(11). Like the difference between the identification and robust-estimation breakdown points, this reflects the focus of identification analysis on ex post inference."
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…the obvious estimation approach is to estimate Q by its empirical distribution Q(n) and compute the restrictions on P(11) and P(1) under Q(n). If the break-down point is not known a priori  but a consistent estimator of the bound(n) is available, the breakdown point can be replaced by this value.
138~D1~M1~Methodology~Robust Estimation~…the problem of developing confidence intervals for the bounds is not treated here since the main focus of this paper is on identification.

139~D1~V5~Variable~Participation in Education Opportunities~…as the dependent variable of interest in the present work.
139~D1~V5~Variable~Participation in Education Opportunities~…measured using responses to the CPS question about whether the reason a respondent was not working in the observation year was due to the pursuit of educational opportunities.

139~D1~T2~Time Period~1991-1997~…the post-ADA period.
139~V4~L3~Variable Value~No Protection States~…the number of individuals who both identify as disabled in the CPS and give educational participation as their reason for not being employed in any given year is often extremely small (less than 5) in this state group.
139~D1~D1~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…1987 is the first observation year for which information on disability status is available in the CPS.
139~D1~T2~Time Period~1991-1997~"…while the ADA went into effect in 1992, it was passed in June 1990, and from the perspective of examining educational investment prompted by ADA-driven innovation in the legal treatment of employment discrimination the relative ""start date"" is the date on which the ADA would have been viewed as a reliable basis on which to make decisions about educational investments."
139~V4~L2~Variable Value~Limited Protection States~…states in which the ADA's employment discrimination provisions were an innovation relative to pre-ADA state law.
139~V4~L1~Variable Value~Control States~…states in which the ADA's employment discrimination provisions were not an innovation relative to pre-ADA state law.
139~D1, D2~F1~Findings~ADA Educational Partipation Effect on Limited Protection States Relative to Control States~…the proportion of disabled individuals who give education participation as the reason for not being employed declines in the limited protection state group relative to the control state group by a state-time difference of -0.0039, however a similar pattern holds for nondisabled individuals, leaving no significant relative effect of ADA-driven innovation on the education participation of individuals with disabilities.
139~D1, D2~F2~Findings~ADA Educational Partipation Effect on No Protection States Relative to Control States~…educational participation of individuals with disabilities increased with the Ada's enactment in the no-protection group relative to the control group whereas for the nondisabled, educational participation declined with the ADA's enactment in the no-protection group relative to the control group.
139~D1, D2~L3~Variable Value~No Protection States~…states in which the ADA's employment discrimination provisions were the most signficant innovation to pre-ADA state law.

139~D1, D2~F3~Findings~No Protection State Marginal Effect of ADA Enactment On Disabled Educational Participation~…the estimated marginal effect of the ADA's enactment on disabled educational participation in no-protection states compared to control states is 0.025 and 0.024 respectively when 1987 to 1989 are treated as the pre-ADA years and 1990 to 1997 as the post-ADA years, 0.011 when 1987 to 1990 are treated as the pre-ADA years and 1991 to 1997 as the post-ADA years, and 0.013 when 1987 to 1990 are treated as the pre-ADA years and 1993 to 1997 are treated as the post-ADA years reflecting more than a doubling of the pre-ADA probability of disabled educational participation in no-protection states, 0.0098.
139~D1, D2~L3~Variable Value~No Protection States~…consists of only three states initiating basic concern that a large increase in disabled educational investment in one state, generated by some state-specific effect rather than by ADA-driven innovation, could be masking declines in disabled educational investment in the other states, which would make a causal link to the ADA unlikely.
139~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Relative Educational Investment for Control vs No Protection States~…relative disabled educational investment followed an upward pattern in all three states in the no-protection group, compared to the trend in the control group.
139~D1, D2~L3~Variable Value~No Protection States~…lack of diversity within the group is a problem that arises from the possibility that an unobserved shock in the souther region of the country between the pre- and post-ADA periods might be driving the apparent effect of the ADA's enactment on disabled education participation in the no-protection group, if it differentially affected disabled and nondisabled individuals.
139~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Disabled Educational Participation and the ADA Enactment~…this paper offers preliminary evidence that disabled educational participation responded positively to the ADA's enactment in states with no pre-ADA restictions on disability based discrimination in employment.
139~D1~D1~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…given the data limitations in the CPS, at most the empirical results presented in this paper provide very preliminary evidence.
140~140: Immigrant Selectivity and Wages: The Evidence for Women~~~~
140~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context

140~D1~V1~Variable~Wages~…are assumed to be a function of standard human capital variables and, for immigrants, selectivity on uobserved chaacteristics resulting from the decision to migrate.
140~D1~V2~Variable~Marital Status~…an indicator variable used in order to limit the data sample drawn from the Current Population Survey.
140~D1~L1~Variable Value~Single~…because the labor-supply decision of single women is likely to differ, these women have been dropped from the sample.
140~D1~V3~Variable~Female~…all relevant observations are from female respondents of the Current Population Survey.
140~D1~V4~Variable~Immigrant Status~…an indicator variable used in order to determine whether a respondent is either native- or foreign-born.
140~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data makes controlling for the effects of selectivity on wages difficult because exisiting data does not provide information about individuals who chose not to migrate, while also leaving out relevant information such as home-country wages, expected United States wages, and migration costs for those who chose not to migrate.
140~D2~T4~Time Period~1955-1983~…time period from which Macro-Level data was collected on social and economic conditions for approximately 60 conditions through various points in this period.
140~D2~D2~Dataset~Macro-Level Data~…data on the economic and social conditions at the time of migration as included in the estimated wage  equation of immigrants.
140~D2~D2~Dataset~Macro-Level Data~…variables are chosen from this dataset so as to relate to the underlying parameters of the unobsezrved quality distribution as closely as possible.
140~D2~D2~Dataset~Macro-Level Data~…data on social and economic conditions for approximately 60 countries collected for various points in the time period 1955 to 1983 from various sources includinggross domestic product data from the World Bank (1980, 1983), Yearbook of National Accounts Statistics (various years) and International Financial Statistics (1986), income inequality data from Jain Shail (1975) and the World Bank (1980), distance data from Gary L.

140~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Relative Returns to Education~…included to control for differences in the return to market skills between the United States and the home country.
140~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Household Status~…previous literature has determined that migration decisions of individuals and households differ, making it important to control for a woman's household status at the time of migration.
140~D2~V5~Variable~Gross Domestic Product~…as this variable increases, it is assumed to lead to incentives to invest in market skills and, hence, higher quality.
140~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Relative Returns to Education~…this variable was compiled from a variety of country-specific estimates of the marginal returns to a secondary education from Psacharopoulos (1985).
140~D2~V5~Variable~Gross Domestic Product~…per capita, measured in $1,000 U.S. (1980 constant); home country minus United States Value because immigrant selectivity is a function of the difference between average quality in the home country and average quality in the United States.
140~D2~V5~Variable~Gross Domestic Product~…assumed to capture the incentive to invest in market skills, acting as a control for differences in mean quality.
140~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Income Inequality~…income accruing to top 5% relative to bottom 20% of households; United States minus home country value.
140~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Income Inequality~…assumed to act as a crude proxy for within-country variance in quality.
140~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Relative Returns to Education~…United States minus home country value.
140~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Relative Returns to Education~…caputres the effects of different returns to market skills between countries.
140~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Work Preferences~…percentage of immigrants entering the United States under first preference (1955 to 1965) and under third and sixth preference (1965 to 1983).
140~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Work Preferences~…reflects the relationship between quality and migration costs; because these preferences are skill-based, the more individuals entering the United States under an occupational preference the stronger will be the relationship between quality and costs.
140~D2~T2~Time Period~1955-1965~…the time period during which immigrants enter the United States under first preference.
140~D2~T3~Time Period~1965-1983~…the time period during which immigrants enter the United States under third and sixth preference.
140~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Household Status~…a binary dummy variable which equals 1 if the woman was a household immigrant.
140~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Household Status~…included because the migration decision differs for individuals and households.
140~D2~V6~Variable~Distance~…minimum distance (in 10,000 miles) between home capital and Miami, Los Angeles, or New York.
140~D2~V6~Variable~Distance~…migration costs are assumed to be positively related to the distance involved.
140~D2~V8~Variable~Fellow Compatriots~…indicates whether an individual has fellow compatriots in the United States/home-country population.
140~D2~V9~Variable~Visa Backlog~…relative to home-country population.
140~D2~V9~Variable~Visa Backlog~…a large backlog in visa applications makes obtaining a visa difficult.
140~D2~V9~Variable~Visa Backlog~…in general, the cost of obtaining an immigration visa is assumed to be positively related to the difficulty involved.
140~D2~V9~Variable~Visa Backlog~…if the opportunity cost of obtaining a visa is assumed to be positively related to the difficulty involved, United States immigration policy can be incorporated into the migration decision as a cost of migration.
140~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…in a linear wage equation estimated for a sample of both positively and negatively selected individuals, the estimated coefficient on migration costs confounds both effects making it useful to control for the effects of migrant selectivity by estimating a nonlinear wage equation.
140~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Equation 1~…explanatory variables include a vector of demographic and human-capital characteristics, a dummy variable which equals 1 for immigrants, returns to education work preferences, weights, and a vector containing all immigration variables.

140~D2~V5~Variable~Gross Domestic Product~…included to control for differences in quality across home-country populations.
140~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Direction of Selectivity~…the direction of selectivity is determined by the covariance between quality and the gains to migration which is a function of two effects: the relative importance of quality in determining wages in the two countries and the relationship between quality and migration costs.
140~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Direction of Selectivity~…the direction of migrant selectivity is proxied in the wage equation for with a weighted sum of the relative returns to education in each country and the percentage of immigrants who entered under an occupational preference.
140~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Direction of Selectivity~…migrant selectivity is inversely related to the probability of emigrating.
140~D2~V8~Variable~Fellow Compatriots~…the number of fellow compatriots in the United States measures potential family members.
140~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Work Preferences~…the percentage of immigrants entering the United States under a skill-based preference is a measure of the relationship between immigrant quality and migration costs.
140~D2~V9~Variable~Visa Backlog~…provides information about the waiting time to obtain a visa.
140~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Household Status~…since the migration decision of women who migrate as individuals differs from that of women who migrate as household members, the covariance between quality and the gains to migration depends on household status.
140~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Household Proxies~…proxies for underlying relationships between the characteristics of household members weighted on the returns to education and the work preferences variables.
140~DV7~L2~Variable Value~Individuals~…the proxies on returns to education and work preferences for individuals are 1 and 1, respectively.
140~DV7~L3~Variable Value~Adult Household Migrants~…the proxies on returns to education and work preferences for adult household migrants are 1.4 and 0.67, respectively.
140~DV7~L4~Variable Value~Child Household Members~…the proxies on returns to education and work preferences for children household members are 0.45 and 0.3, respectively.
140~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Equation 1~…this formulation has the advantage that the effects of parameter changes on migrant quality have the same sign for both positively and negatively selected individuals.
140~D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Expected Immigrant Quality~…the impact of distance to the United States, a measure of migration costs, on expected immigrant quality.
140~D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Expected Immigrant Quality~…the inclusion of the relative returns to education and the work preferences variables weighted by their according household characteristic proxies is assumed to control for whether immigrants are positively or negatively selected in calculating expected immigrant quality.
140~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Relative Income Inequality and Wages~…relative income inequality appears to be positively and significantly related to wage rates with significant coefficients ranging from 0.1002 to 0.1016.
140~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Relative GDP and Wages~…relative GDP per capita appears to be positively and significantly related to wage rates with significant coefficients ranging from 0.1547 to 0.2376.
140~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Relative Returns to Education and Wages~…relative returns to education appears to be positively and signficantly related to wage rates with a single significant coefficient equal to 0.0767.
140~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Work Preferences and Wages~…although significant only when the backlog in visa applications is included, the percentage of individuals entering the United States under an occupational preference category is positively related to subsequent wages with a highly significant coefficient of 0.1801.
140~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Household Status and Wages~…women who migrated as household members earn significantly higher wages than those who migrated as individuals with highly significant coefficients on the household variable ranging from 1.4704 to 1.4529.
140~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Mean Derivatives~…to evaluate how well the nonlinear equation fits the data, derivatives evaluated at the means were computed and then compared to the regression coefficients from the linear model, which provides estimates fo the mean derivatives.
140~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…the regression coefficients from the linear model provide estimates for the mean derivatives for which allows comparison between the actual mean derivatives computed with the nonlinear regression estimates.
140~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Estimated vs. Actual Mean Derivatives~…in almost all cases, with the exception being for the derivatives for the number of years since migration in the first two sets of regressions, the directions of the computed derivatives from the linear and nonlinear procedures were the same; furthermore, with the only exception being for the computed derivatives for the dummy variable measuring household status in the first two sets of regressions, the magnitudes of the computed derivatives were quite similar, a finding suggesting that, in general, the nonlinear equation fits the data reasonably well.
140~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Replacing Conditions w/ Regional Dummy Variables~…additional estimation shows that when the variables capturing conditions at the time of migration are replaced in the wage equation by simple dummy variables reflecting region of origin, these dummies are not jointly significant at the 5% level, suggesting that immigrant selectivity seems to caputre effects that are missed in a simple consideration of national origin.
140~D1~V10~Variable~Regional Dummies~…a collection of regional dummy variables replacing migrational time conditions.
140~D1~V10~Variable~Regional Dummies~…not explicitly reported or explained in this research paper.
140~D1~V3~Variable~Female~…because the labor market behavior of women differs from that of men, the experience of female immigrants must be explicitly considered.
140~D2~D2~Dataset~Macro-Level Data~…the empirical results are necessarily on weaker ground because the data chosen to caputre the migration decision are ad hoc and at best act only as proxies for the process one would like to describe.
141~141: Immigrants and the Labor Market~~~~
141~Parent Object~Label~Tag ~Value~Context
141~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Schooling~…schooling is the most basic index of skill, and how much education migrants had when they arrived may be critical in determining their eventual economic success or failure.
141~D1, D2, D3~V2~Variable~Immigrant Status~…immigrants are generally thought to have much less schooling than native-born Americans, a disparity that has been growing over time.
141~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Education Gap~…this variable is used to plot trends in the education gap between Migrants to the United States and native-born Americans for selected years between 1940 and 2002.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…data on education gaps were obtained from the six decennial censuses between 1940 and 1990.
141~D1~T1~Time Period~1940-1990~…survey period from which data was drawn from six decennial censuses.
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data on education gaps were obtained from the 1996 and 2002 Current Population Surveys.
141~D2~T2~Time Period~1996, 2002~…survey years from which Current Population Survey data on education gaps was drawn.
141~V2~L1~Variable Value~Recent Immigrant~"…recent immigrants are those who came to the United States in the last 5 years before the survey; this is the conventional definition of ""recent immigrants"" used by labor economists in a wide variety of applications."
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the 1950 census identifies immigrant status but not length of stay, leaving no clear distinction between recent immigrants and those who have been in the country for longer than 5 years.
141~D1, D2, D3~V2~Variable~Immigrant Status~…the comparison group is always the comparable native-born population.
141~DV1~L2~Variable Value~All Immigrant Education Gap~…plotting this figure over time describes changes in the stock of immigrants.
141~DV1~L3~Variable Value~Recent Immigrant Education Gap~…plotting this figure over time indicates trends for the new inflows of immigrants.
141~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Mean Education Levels by Immigrant Status Over the Relevant Period~…since 1940, mean education levels have risen rapidly over time for all groups - by 4.4 years for the native-born, by an even larger 5.3 years for all foreign-born, and by 3.4 years for recent migrants. For the stock group, the education disadvantage of migrants has actually been declining over time while the schooling gap by nativity has been simultaneously rising when one examines only new recent immigrant inflows.
141~DV1~L2~Variable Value~All Immigrant Education Gap~…the education gap between the typical adult foreign-born person and the typical adult native-born American in any of the years represented in the figure.
141~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Migrant Stock~…the stock of migrants is weighted heavily by the history of the volume and character of past migration flows.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…this data source has a general tendency to inflate education, even throughout closed cohorts.
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source has a general tendency to inflate education, even throughout closed cohorts.
141~V2~L1~Variable Value~Recent Immigrant~…even if researchers ignore the stock-flow distinction, the common use of data on recent immigrants overstates the extent of the labor market quality differences between immigrants and the native-born. First, it ignores the substantial education and skill investments immigrants make postmigration. Second, it does not weight imigrants by the duration of their stay in the United States.
141~D2~F2~Findings~Recent Immigrant Schooling From 1996 to 2002~"…in the 1996 CPS, Mexican ""recent"" immigrants who entered between 1990 and 1996 had 7.9 years of schooling. In contrast, in the 2002 CPS, Mexican immigrants who reported that they entered during those years had 8.8 years of schooling."
141~V2~L1~Variable Value~Recent Immigrant~…focusing only on migrants during their first 5 years of stay is portraying them at their worst. Moreover, given the growing numbers of undocumented among recent migrants, it is likely that this bias has grown over time so that the improvement in education of stayers within a given immigrant cohort has grown over time.
141~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Gender~…included to determine whether education trends contingent on immigrant status are the same for male and female immigrants.
141~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Education Gap by Gender from 1996 to 2002~…by 2002 recent female migrants actually had slightly more schooling than did recent male migrants to the United States - 12.4 years of schooling for women compared to 12.2 years for men.
141~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Education Gap~…an important caveat is that the description of the schooling gap is limited to mean differences only. Differences in schooling distributions between recent immigrants and the native-born are much bigger than the mean difference alone would imply
141~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Education Gap by Immigrant Status in 2002~…in 2002, 27% of recent immigrants did not graduate from high school compared to 12% of the native-born, while 14% of recent immigrants had more than a college degree compared to 10% of the native-born. The relatively small difference in means in that year certainly does not imply that the large differences in the bottom tail are of little consequence and should be ignored.
141~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Wage Gap~…plots trends in the percent wage gap between recent male migrants and male native-born workers among men between the ages of 25 and 54.
141~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Migrant Wage Gap~…starting at about an 18% wage gap in 1970, the average migrant wage gap grew steadily larger, reaching a peak at 30%. While there apparently has been some recovery in recent years, it remains the case that a story of declining relative skills of new migrants appears to have considerable support from wage data.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Gap~…age as one of three other forces that should be examined first to assess its impact on the expanding wage gap of recent immigrants.
141~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Native-Born Male Price Growth~…prices as one of three other forces that should be examined first to assess its impact on the expanding wage gap of recent immigrants.
141~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Matched Weekly Wage Distribution~…prices one of three other forces that should be examined first to assess its impact on the expanding wage gap of recent immigrants.
141~V2~L8~Variable Value~Recent Undocumented ~…one of three other forces that should be examined first to assess its impact on the expanding wage gap of recent immigrants.
141~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Wage Gap~…as is usually the case, the focus turns exclusively to men when wages and labor market data are used. Bringing in women raises many complicating issues about labor force participation and the selectivity of the wages based on labor force participants only.
141~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Income~…income is defined as wage and salary income.
141~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Wage Gap~…percent wage differentials are computed as the natural logs of the ratio of the arithmetic means of recent immigrants compared to the native-born.
141~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Wage Gap~…all male recent immigrants are compared to all male native-born, both between the ages of 25 and 54.
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…one issue that has received considerable attention concerns the importance of the exclusion of the institutionalized population from the Current Population Survey files. However, this is most likely to be a far less serious issue among immigrants as, among male prison inmates between the ages of 18 and 54, in 1991, 5.4% were noncitizens. In contrast, noncitizens make up about 7% of the population of this age group.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…in the 1990 census data, rates of institutionalization for men ages 18 to 40 were 1.5% for immigrants, 2.2% for the native-born, and 8.1% for native born blacks.
141~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Recent Migrant Age Gap from 1940 to 2002~…over the full span of years from 1940 to 2002, the age gap for recent migrants has expanded by more than 6 years.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Gap~…the age difference of foreign-born (with native-born) individuals computed as native-born age minus foreign-born age.
141~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Age Adjusted Wage Disparity~…the age adjusted wage disparity of recent immigrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Gap~…while one could argue that age is simply another dimension of skill, the author thinks that an increasing immigrant wage gap that is simply due to the fact that American workers are getting older or immigrants are getting younger is not what should be mean by an expanding skill gap of immigrants.
141~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Age Adjusted Wage Disparity~…to age-adjust the time series wage gap between recent migrants and the native-born, for men between the ages of 25 and 54, the reseracher estimated separately for the native-born and for recent immigrants a series of year-specific standard Mincerian log weekly wage equations with years of schooling and an age quadratic as controls.
141~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Mincerian Log Weekly Wage~…to age-adjust the time series wage gap between recent migrants and the native-born, for men between the ages of 25 and 54, the reseracher estimated separately for the native-born and for recent immigrants a series of year-specific standard Mincerian log weekly wage equations with years of schooling and an age quadratic as controls. In the recent immigrant models, ethnic dummies for European, Asian, and Latino ancestry were also included.
141~D1, D2, D3~V7~Variable~Ethnicity~…in the recent immigrant Mincerian Log Weekly Wage models, ethnic dummies were included.
141~V7, V9~L4~Variable Value~European~…an ethnic dummy variable specifying for European ancestry.
141~V7, V9~L5~Variable Value~Asian~…an ethnic dummy variable specifying for Asian ancestry.
141~V7, V9~L6~Variable Value~Hispanic~…an ethnic dummy variable specifying for Latino ancestry.
141~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Age Adjusted Wage Disparity~…using the estimated quadratic age profiles, the log weekly wages of both the native-born and recent migrants were then adjusted in each year so that the log wages of both groups would be evaluated at the same age.
141~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Age Adjusted Wage Disparity~…the constant age chose by the researcher was 38, since it is close to the age of the current average male native-born worker.
141~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Age Adjusted Wage Disparity~…this age adjustment on the recent migrant wage gap not only dampens the expanding wage gap of recent immigrants since 1970 but also leaves trends at a point in 2002 that is not all that different from 1970.
141~D1, D2, D3~V6~Variable~Age~…this variable is used to calculate the age gap and the age adjusted wage disparity.
141~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Income~…wages are the product of prices and skills, and one should always be wary of assigning all observed wage trends to skills.
141~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Native-Born Male Price Growth~…shows what has happened to real wages between 190 and 2002 at each percentile of the native-born male wage distribution.
141~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Median Wage Gap vs. Relevant Age Gap from 1970 to 2002~…while median wages were roughly constant in real terms, the gap between the real wages at the 90th and 10th percentile increased by almost 40% between 1970 and 2002.
141~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Native-Born Male Price Growth~…male native-born percentage wage growth by percentiles (1970-2002).
141~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Matched Weekly Wage Distribution~…this measure documents that the starting points of the two populations - the native-born and recent immigrants - were quite different in 1970.
141~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Matched Weekly Wage Distribution~…matched wage percentiles of recent immigrants with native-born in 1970.
141~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Matched Weekly Wage Distribution~…using data from the 1970 census, this figure maps percentiles of the weekly wage distributions of recent male migrants on the weekly wage distribution of native-born men.
141~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Inequality Adjusted Wage Disparity~…given large differences between recent immigrants and the native-born in 1970 and in light of the subsequently large increase in the skill price of labor by wage percentiles in 1970, the wage gap between these two populations would have expanded even if their relative skill distributions had remained the same. With this in mind, the author eliminated from the observed time series trends that component o f the increase in the migrant wage gap that was a consequence of the rising price of skill since 1970.
141~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Native-Born Male Price Growth~…included as a proxy for the price of skill.
141~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Matched Weekly Wage Distribution~…included as a proxy for the price of skill.
141~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Inequality Adjusted Wage Disparity~…wage inequality adjustments were done for men between the ages of 25 and 54. Using 1970 as the base year, the first step involved computing at each percentile of the native-born male weekly wage distribution the ratio of real weekly wages in each subsequent year relative to the same wage percentile in 1970. In the second step, in each year percentile in the weekly wage distributions of recent foreign-born immigrants were matched to percentiles of weekly wages of native-born men so that at each percentile weekly wages were the same for both groups. The comparable native-born wage percentile wage growth tells us what would have happened to immigrant real weekly wage at every wage percentile if recent immigrants were treated the same as the native-born in terms of real wage growth as a consequence of a rising skill price. Mean wages of this hypothetical weekly wage distribution of recent immigrants was used to adjust the data to obtain the wage inequality adjusted wage gaps.
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source is unable to distinguish between legal and illegal migrant flows.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…this data source is unable to distinguish between legal and illegal migrant flows.
141~V7, V9~L5~Variable Value~Asian~…among recent legal immigrants, Asians are the most numerous, making up almost 40% of that category.
141~V2~L7~Variable Value~Recent Legal~…overall, 57% of the legal recent migrants arrived from Asia and Europe, where the average skills of migrants are quite high.
141~V2~L8~Variable Value~Recent Undocumented ~…more than three quarters of all undocumented migrants are Latinos, and about 60% are from a single country - Mexico.
141~D3~D3~Dataset~New Immigrant Survey-Pilot~…a nationally representative data sample of new legal migrants who received their green cards in 1996.
141~D3~D3~Dataset~New Immigrant Survey-Pilot~…based on probability samples of administrative records of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, the NIS-P links survey information about immigrants' pre- and postimmigration labor market, schooling, and migratory experiences with data available from INS administrative records, including the visa type under which the immigrant was admitted.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the 1996 Current Population Survey represents all recent migrants (legal and illegal alike).
141~V2~L8~Variable Value~Recent Undocumented ~…with the Current Population Survey and New Immigrant Survey-Pilot data, researchers are able to describe three distinct populations as follows: all recent migrants from the Current Population Survey, legal migrants only from the NiS-P, and the residual group - the difference between the first two, that is, recent undocumented groups.
141~V2~L7~Variable Value~Recent Legal~…with the Current Population Survey and New Immigrant Survey-Pilot data, researchers are able to describe three distinct populations as follows: all recent migrants from the Current Population Survey, legal migrants only from the NiS-P, and the residual group - the difference between the first two, that is, recent undocumented groups.
141~V2~L9~Variable Value~All Legal and Illegal~…with the Current Population Survey and New Immigrant Survey-Pilot data, researchers are able to describe three distinct populations as follows: all recent migrants from the Current Population Survey, legal migrants only from the NiS-P, and the residual group - the difference between the first two, that is, recent undocumented groups.
141~V2~L8~Variable Value~Recent Undocumented ~…more precisely, the residual group also includes temporary legal migrants, i.e. those who reside in the United States legally but on a temporary visa. However, the dominant group in the residual category is the undocumented.
141~D3~D3~Dataset~New Immigrant Survey-Pilot~…data for recent legal immigrants are obtained from the New Immigrant Pilot Survey (NIS-P, 1996).
141~V2~L7~Variable Value~Recent Legal~…data for recent legal immigrants are obtained from the New Immigrant Pilot Survey (NIS-P, 1996).
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data for recent foreign-born are obtained from the 1996 Current Population Survey.
141~V2~L1~Variable Value~Recent Immigrant~…data for recent foreign-born are obtained from the 1996 Current Population Survey. These immigrants came to the United States either less than 3 years ago or less than 5 years ago.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Fraction of Legal Immigrants~…the fraction of immigrants who are legal relative to the total number of immigrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Wage Rate of Illegals to Legals~…the wage rate of illegal immigrants relative to legal immigrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Fraction of Illegal Immigrants~…levels and changes in levels in the fraction of migrants who are undocumented.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Wage Rate of Illegals to Legals~…levels and changes in levels in the wage gap between legal and undocumented migrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Wage Rate of Illegals to Legals~…the enormous differences in ethnicity and in education between these two populations, i.e. legals and illegals, suggest that undocumented migrants earn much less than legal migrants do.
141~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~Mean Education Gap and Returns to Schooling for Legals vs. Illegals~…the 2.5-year difference in mean education between illegals and legals with an 8% return to schooling would by itself imply that wages of illegals would be 20% less than those of legals. Similarly, if legals and illegals within the same ethnic group were paid the same, the differences in ethnic distributions would indicate that illegals would earn 70% of the wages of legal migrants.
141~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Income~…shows earnings in the home country as well as in the United States for a random sample of legal migrants who came to the United States in 1996. These now legal migrants are separated into those who previously had illegal work experience in the United States and those who did not.
141~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Wage Disparity for Legals vs. Illegals~…the wage disparity between legal migrants who previously had illegal work experience in the United States and those who did not is quite large. In their jobs in the United States in this sample, undocumented migrants earned 74% as much as legal migrants. Once again this wage disparity is most likely an understatement of the wage gap between all recent legal and illegal migrants.
141~V2~L7~Variable Value~Recent Legal~…while these legal immigrants may be representative of all recent legal migrants the undocumented migrants in this sample are quite unique in that they eventually made the transition to legal status, a process that favors the more skilled.
141~V2~L8~Variable Value~Recent Undocumented ~…those undocumented migrants who never transitioned to legal status (the majority) most likely earned less than those who successfully made that transition.
141~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Income~…for the purpose of the simulation of the impact of illegal migrants on wage trends on migrants, the author uses the assumption that undocumented migrants earn 60% of what legal migrants do. Moreover, the author will assume that this wage ratio has not changed over time, making the second term in equation (1) equal to zero. This assumption will understate the extent to which the wages of legal and illegal migrants grew apart over the last 30 years, since it is far more likely that the wage disparity between legals and illegals grew in light of the proskill bias in changes in the legal immigration policy.
141~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~~…this estimation formula tells us what factors determine secular changes in the relative wage of all recent migrants (which can be observed in the Current Population Survey and the census files) compared to the wage of legal migrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~~…the change in the ratio of the wage of recent foreign-born to recent legal immigrants is equal to the change in the fraction of immigrants who are legal times 1 minus the wage rate of illegals to legals plus 1 minus the fraction of immigrants who are legal times the change in the wage rate of illegals to legals.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Fraction of Illegal Immigrants~…the fraction of new immigrants who are illegal.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Illegal-Adjusted Education Disparity~…the eductation gap between migrants and the native-born can also be adjusted for the changing fraction of migrants who are illegal. To do this, the education of legal migrants is obtained from the 1996 New Immigrant Pilot Survey. Assuming that the education gap between undocumented and legal migrants has remained constant over time (a conservative assumption for this purpose) figures describe trends in the education gap between legal immigrants and native-born Americans, finding no trend at all.
141~D3~D3~Dataset~New Immigrant Survey-Pilot~…the education of legal migrants is obtained from the 1996 New Immigrant Pilot Survey.
141~V2~L7~Variable Value~Recent Legal~…according to the data, legal migrants appear on average to be as least as skilled as the average American worker, and they are, at a minimum, keeping up with native-born Americans.
141~D1, D2, D3~V2~Variable~Immigrant Status~…the distinction between trends for legal and undocumented migrants is important, since the policies that produce the flows are quite different.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…one problem in studying generational assimilation concers the ambiguity in defining generations across different census and CPS files.
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…one problem in studying generational assimilation concers the ambiguity in defining generations across different census and CPS files.
141~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Generations~…one problem in studying generational assimilation concers the ambiguity in defining generations across different census and CPS files.
141~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Generations~…in this research, generations are aggregated into three groups.
141~V8~L10~Variable Value~First Generation~…the first immigrant generation was born outside of the United States
141~V8~L11~Variable Value~Second Generation~…the second generation includes thos with at least one parent being born outside of the United States.
141~V8~L12~Variable Value~Third Generation~…the third generation includes those with both parents born in the United States.
141~V8~L12~Variable Value~Third Generation~…when reference is made to the third generation, due to the form in which the data come, it actually includes all generations beyond the second
141~D1, D2, D3~V7~Variable~Ethnicity~…due to conceptual and data reasons, defining ethnicity is very difficult.
141~V7, V9~L5~Variable Value~Asian~…there were two ways that someone was identified as Asian. The first method used the race question regularly asked in the census and the Current Population Survey and counted all those who self-identified as Asian in response to that question. Reserachers then defined the specific Asian generation by place of birth - if they were foreign-born, they were second generation Asian; and if neither parent nor the respondent was foreign born, then they were counted as third-generation Asian. Alternatively, for the first and second generations only, the author used a specific list of Asian countires or birth to assign Asian ancestry. Fortunately, the overlap between these two methods was very large. 
141~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Ethnicity, Generation~…there were two ways that someone was identified as Asian. The first method used the race question regularly asked in the census and the Current Population Survey and counted all those who self-identified as Asian in response to that question. Researchers then defined the specific Asian generation by place of birth - if they were foreign-born, they were second generation Asian; and if neither parent nor the respondent was foreign born, then they were counted as third-generation Asian.
141~DV11~L13~Variable Value~Asian, First~…indicates an Asian individual who was foreign born.
141~DV11~L14~Variable Value~Asian, Second~…indicates an Asian individual who has at least one foreign-born parent.
141~DV11~L15~Variable Value~Asian, Third~…indicates an Asian individual who has no foreign-born parents.
141~D2~F10~Findings~Country of Origin and Race/Ethnic Identification Divide~…using the 1996 Current Population Survey, 94% of the foreign-born who said that they were of Asian race were also born in the list of Asian countries used, and 90% of those who were born in the selected Asian countires also said that their race was Asian.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Ethnicity, Generation~…the analyses reported in this research were simultaneously conducted for both the race and country definitions of Asian, and noe of the conclusions were affected.
141~V7, V9~L6~Variable Value~Hispanic~…determining first- and second-generation Hispanics was relatively straightforward, since place of birth or self-reported ethnicity is available and either can be used to assign Hispanic ethnicity.
141~DV11~L16~Variable Value~Hispanic, First~…determining first- and second-generation Hispanics was relatively straightforward, since place of birth or self-reported ethnicity is available and either can be used to assign Hispanic ethnicity.
141~DV11~L17~Variable Value~Hispanic, Second~…determining first- and second-generation Hispanics was relatively straightforward, since place of birth or self-reported ethnicity is available and either can be used to assign Hispanic ethnicity.
141~DV11~L18~Variable Value~Hispanic, Third~…the main problem concerns the third generation, where they type of information available to assess if someone was of Hispanic descent differs across the various censuses and CPSs.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the 1940, 1950, 1960 and 1970 censuses asked respondents whether they had a Spanish surname. As an additional source of Hispanic ancestry, the 1940, 1960 and 1970 censuses asked if Spanish was spoken in the home. In all of the other data sources used, the author defines Hispanic ethnicity in the third generation by respondent self-identification.
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in this data source, the author defines Hispanic ethnicity in the third generation by respondent self-identification.
141~D3~D3~Dataset~New Immigrant Survey-Pilot~…in this data source, the author defines Hispanic ethnicity in the third generation by respondent self-identification.
141~DV11~L18~Variable Value~Hispanic, Third~…the 1940, 1950, 1960 and 1970 censuses asked respondents whether they had a Spanish surname. As an additional source of Hispanic ancestry, the 1940, 1960 and 1970 censuses asked if Spanish was spoken in the home. In all of the other data sources used, the author defines Hispanic ethnicity in the third generation by respondent self-identification.
141~V7, V9~L6~Variable Value~Hispanic~…in all analyses of Latinos reported in the analysis, Puerto Ricans are excluded given their special status that technically excludes them as immigrants.
141~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Race~…when the race question was used to categorize, Europe was the residual category. That is, one was of European ancestry if one did not claim being Hispanic, Asian, black, or Native American.
141~V7, V9~L6~Variable Value~Hispanic~…one of five race categories drawn from demographic characteristic observations in CPS, censuses and NIS-P data.
141~V7, V9~L5~Variable Value~Asian~…one of five race categories drawn from demographic characteristic observations in CPS, censuses and NIS-P data.
141~V9~L19~Variable Value~Black~…one of five race categories drawn from demographic characteristic observations in CPS, censuses and NIS-P data.
141~V9~L20~Variable Value~Native American~…one of five race categories drawn from demographic characteristic observations in CPS, censuses and NIS-P data.
141~V7, V9~L4~Variable Value~European~…one of five race categories drawn from demographic characteristic observations in CPS, censuses and NIS-P data.
141~V7, V9~L4~Variable Value~European~…when the race question was used to categorize, Europe was the residual category. That is, one was of European ancestry if one did not claim being Hispanic, Asian, black, or Native American.
141~DV11~L21~Variable Value~European, First~…when the race question was used to categorize, Europe was the residual category. That is, one was of European ancestry if one did not claim being Hispanic, Asian, black, or Native American. The generations were then assigned with the same algorithm used for Asians.
141~DV11~L22~Variable Value~European, Second~…when the race question was used to categorize, Europe was the residual category. That is, one was of European ancestry if one did not claim being Hispanic, Asian, black, or Native American. The generations were then assigned with the same algorithm used for Asians.

141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the 1960 census asked whether a person in one of the five Southwestern states had a Spanish surname.
141~DV11~L18~Variable Value~Hispanic, Third~…the 1960 census asked whether a person in one of the five Southwestern states had a Spanish surname. When the Spanish surname questions were asked for all states in 1950, 92% of all Mexicans in the third generation lived in these five southwestern states.
141~D1~V11~Variable~Southwestern States~…observations from the 1960 census used to specify for whether an individual lived in one of the five Southwestern states.

141~DV11~L23~Variable Value~European, Third~…by necessity, third-generation Europeans always had to be defined using the residual race method, but this is not much of an issue given immigration history to the United States.
141~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Country of Origin~…a list of possible countires of birth for respondents and parents used to identify first-, second-, and third-generation status as well as ethnic background.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Ethnicity, Generation~…no matter which procedure is used, constructing this generational data requires that information on country of birth exists for both respondents and their parents and that some method is available for identifying ethnicity.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the requirements that information on country of birth exists for both respondents and their parents and that some method is available for identifying ethnicitiy are met by the 1940 to 1970 decennial censuses inclusive, but, after 1970, generations beyond the first were not distinguished in the censuses.

141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…starting in 1994, March Current Population Survey incorporated a number of changes that made these surveys more useful for immigrant research. In particular, questions were added concerning immigrant status (and that of the parent), the number of years since immigration, and ethnicity. While containing much smaller sample sizes than the decennial census files, these recent Current Population Survey innovations make that data useful for the more recent periods.
141~D2~T3~Time Period~Mid-1990s~…for this research, the author uses an average of the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 CPSs to represent the mid-1990s.

141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~...the 1996 survey is used to document the pattern of education accomplishments by immigrant generation that one would obtain from a typical cross-sectional survey.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Education, Ethnicity, Generation~…lists education levels by generation and ethnicity, limited to those of Hispanic, European and Asian descent.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Education, Ethnicity, Generation~…an other CPS or census year than the 1996 CPS survey that is used would show patterns by generation basically similar to those reported.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Education, Ethnicity, Generation~…for each of the three ethnic categories, mean education by generation is first presented for men followed by a parallel set of generational data for women.
141~DV11~L21~Variable Value~European, First~…since there was no way of excluding them from the third plus generations, Canadians were included in the list of European countries for the first two generations.
141~DV11~L22~Variable Value~European, Second~…since there was no way of excluding them from the third plus generations, Canadians were included in the list of European countries for the first two generations.
141~V12~L29~Variable Value~Canada~…since there was no way of excluding them from the third plus generations, Canadians were included in the list of European countries for the first two generations.
141~D1, D2, d3~F11~Findings~Latino Educational Advances~…for both men and women, Latino education levels do rise by almost 3 years between the first and second generation, but in every age group listed the mean education of the third generation is actually less than that of the second. Moreover, across all three generations, Latino schooling gains among men were only about 2.5 years and for Hispanic women only 2.1 years. Sine these generations span at least 50 years, at this pace, generational progress could rightly be labeled as being slow, especially given beliefs about the considerable progress made by the children and grandchildren of the European immigrants and the common perceptions about the educational accomplishments of Asian migrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Generations~…generations span at least 50 years.
141~D1, D2~F12~Findings~European vs. Latino Education Gap~…for men (women), the typical European immigrant had about 4 years (3.5 years) more schooling than the average Latino immigrant. However, for the purposes of this research, the key patterns concern the implied generational increases in education among Europeans. If the author judged only by these cross-sectional patterns, as the educational history of Hispanics is often assessed, the generational story for Europeans would actually be more pessimistic than it is for Latinos, i.e. the total mean schooling increase across all three generations is less than a year for European men and less than half a year for European women.
141~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~Asian vs. Latino Education Gap~…while mean schooling among contemporary Asian migrants is even higher than for the Europeans, average education increases by only 1/20th of a year between the first- and third-generation Asian men.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~5-Year Birth Cohort Cells~…to obtain a single estimate for each 5-year birth cohort cell, mean education by birth cohort and generation across all census and groups of Current Population Survey years were averaged (i.e. the mid-1990s and 2000 time periods).
141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to obtain a single estimate for each 5-year birth cohort cell, mean education by birth cohort and generation across all census and groups of Current Population Survey years were averaged (i.e., the 1994-1997 Current Population Surveys form one group, and the 1999-2002 Current Population Surveys form another group).
141~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Generations~…there is an assumed 25-year lag between generations.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Education, Ethnicity, Generation~…to correctly evaluate generational assimilation, the data must be realigned to match up the children and grandchildren of each set of ethnic immigrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Education, Ethnicity, Generation~…with an assumed 25-year lag between generations, education of the second generation refers to second generations born 25 years after the birth years indexed for immigrants in the first generation. A similar 25-year offset is assumed between the third and second generations.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Education, Ethnicity, Generation~…to the extent that schooling is an adequate proxy for labor market quality, looking at the results for the first generation is a way of monitoring secular changes in the quality of immigrants.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~5-Year Birth Cohort Cells~...since these cells are blended means across as many as five surveys, the underlying sample sizes can be quite large. Consider the critical cohorts where all three generations are present. For example, among Europen men, the smallest first-generation sample size is 3,700 and the largest is over 10,000. Sample sizes are even larger in the second and third generation. For Hispanic males across the same cohorts, first-generation sample sizes are as low as 181 and as high as 1,026. Once again sample sizes are larger for the second and third generations. Sample sizes are lowest for Asian immigrants, ranging from about 100 to about 500 for these cohorts. Given the regularity of these patterns in these tables, these sample sizes appear to be more than sufficient.
141~D1, D2, D3~F14~Findings~Three Generation Educational Advance by Ethnicity~…to take the 1905-9 immigrant birth cohorts as an illustrative example, the increase in mean years of schooling across three generations was 4.6 years for European men and 6.6 years for Asian men. For the same birth cohort, the comparable male education advance was 7.5 years among all Hispanic men and 8.2 years among Mexican males. Similarly, for this birth cohort, European women achieved a 5.1 years of schooling increment, Asian women had a 5.3 year advance, while the mean education of Latinas improved by 6.8 years and that of Mexican women increased by 7.6 years.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~5-Year Birth Cohort Cells~…this figure indexes the year of birth of immigrants in each respective ethnic sample.
141~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Educational Advances~…educational advances can be measured sometimes across all three generations and sometimes only across two generations because the story of the third generation is not yet complete. 
141~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Educational Advances~…reported separately for both men and women and by the three relevant ethnic groups.
141~D1, D2, D3~F15~Findings~Three and Two Generation Educational Advances by Ethnicitiy~…whether measured across all three generations or across just two, for men and women alike, the educational advances made by Latinos are actually greater than those achieved by either European or Asian migrants. There is certainly no evidence from these data that Latinos have lagged behind these other large immigrant groups in their ability to transmit education accomplishments to thier children and grandchildren. This stronger educational transmission among Latinos between the first generation and second generation should not be surprising, since these Latino immigrants, who have relatively low levels of schooling, are sending their children to American schools where the norm is the completion of high school. When comparably educated European immigrants sent their children to American schools many decades earlier, the education completion norms at the time were not as high.
141~V8~L11~Variable Value~Second Generation~…children of immigrants.
141~V8~L12~Variable Value~Third Generation~…grandchildren of immigrants.
141~V8~L12~Variable Value~Third Generation~…by necessity, the third generation refers to all generations beyond the second.
141~DV13~L30~Variable Value~2nd to 3rd Gen. Latino Educational Advances~…by necessity, the third generation refers to all generations beyond the second. This tends to understate the relative educational advances of Latino immigrants between the second generation and the third generation, since a larger fraction of Latinos in the third plus group (compared to Europeans) will actually be members of the third generation. In contrast, many of the Europeans will be members of generations well beyond the third, and unless all generational progress stops at the third generation, this will further increase their education levels.
141~DV13~L31~Variable Value~2nd to 3rd Gen. European Educational Advances~…many of the Europeans will be members of generations well beyond the third, and unless all generational progress stops at the third generation, this will further increase their education levels.
141~Dv13~L30~Variable Value~2nd to 3rd Gen. Latino Educational Advances~…a second reason why the ducational advances of Latinos are understated, at least relative to Europeans, is that, as Latinos intermarry and assimilate across the generations, some subset of them will stop reporting their Latino ancestry.
141~D1, D2, D3~F16~Findings~Economic and Education Differential Persistence~…complete elimination of all economic and educational differentials by the third generation would take a half century, and another generation alone would extend it to 75 years. 
141~D1, D2, D3~F17~Findings~Immigrant Schooling Deficit~…on average, immigrants have less schooling than the native-born, a schooling deficit that reached 1.3 years in 2002.
141~D1, D2, D3~F18~Findings~Ethnic Education Gap~…the education of new European and Asian immigrants is higher than that of native-born Americans, while the typical Latino immigrant continues to trail the native-born by about 4 years of schooling on average.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…in the 1940 census, years of schooling was defined by the highest grade of school completed. Five or more years of college was assinged a value of 17.5.
141~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Schooling~…in the 1940 census, years of schooling was defined by the highest grade of school completed. Five or more years of college was assinged a value of 17.5.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…in the 1950 census, years of schooling was defined by the highest grade attended from which 1 year was subtracted if the respondent was still attending school. Five or more years of college was assinged a vlue of 17.5.

141~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Schooling~…in the 1990 census and beginning in 1992, the Current Population Survey changed its education question from years of schooling to educational attainment categories. Taking advantage of the Current Population Survey practice of rotating households into and out of the survey, the author matches people who responded to the 1991 survey with the same people in the 1992 survey by household I.D., person line number, race, ethnicity, and age. The author then calculated the mean of the years of schooling reported in 1991 by the educational attainment categories used in 1992 for this matched sample. These means were used to assign the values within the 1990 census and post-1992 CPS education categories.

141~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Weekly Wages~…weekly wages are calculated as annual income divided by weeks worked.
141~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Weekly Wages~…the sample for this computation consists of men 25 to 54 years old who did not live in group quarters. Anumber of additional sample restrictions were imposed. The author exluded men who worked less than 50 weeks in the previous year and who were now attending school, who were in the military, who were self-employed or working without pay if they were not employed in agriculture, whose weekly wages put them below the following values: 1970 = $10.00; 1980 = $19.80; 1990 = $33.82; 1995, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001, and 2002 = $40.000, whose computed weekly wages put them above the following values: 1970 = $1,250; 1980 = $1,875; 1990 = $3,202; 1995 = $3,500; 1996 = $3,550; 1997 = $3,600; 2000 = $3,850; 2001 = $3,900; and 2002 = $3,950, and who were in the open-ended upper-income interval and who worked at least 40 weeks last year.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the census contains all open-ended upper income intervals. The means of these top codes were calculated assuming that the upper part of the income distribution followed an exponential distribution, and the following values were assigned: 1940($5,000) = $8,900; 1950 ($10,000) = $22,500; 1960 ($25,000) = $42,500; 1970 ($50,000) = $80,000; 1980 ($75,000) = $115,000; 1990 ($140,000) = $195,000.
141~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Income~…the CPS and census contains all open-ended upper income intervals.

141~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the 2000 census, respondents with wage and salary income equal to $175,000 and above were assigned the state mean for their state of residence based on all people in that state with wage and salary income equal to $175,000 and above.
141~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…weeks worked were coded into broad intervals in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. The following within-interval means, derived from the 1980 census, were assigned: 1 to 13 = 6.5; 14 to 26 = 21.73; 27 to 29 = 33.08; 40 to 47 = 42.67; 48 to 49 = 48.29; and 50 to 52 = 51.82. in other census years, the author used these intervals or the continuous value of weeks worked, and the results were basically identical. In light of this, the author chooses to use the continuous weeks measure in the CPS files.
141~D1~V15~Variable~Weeks Worked~…weeks worked were coded into broad intervals in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. The following within-interval means, derived from the 1980 census, were assigned: 1 to 13 = 6.5; 14 to 26 = 21.73; 27 to 29 = 33.08; 40 to 47 = 42.67; 48 to 49 = 48.29; and 50 to 52 = 51.82. in other census years, the author used these intervals or the continuous value of weeks worked, and the results were basically identical.

142~142: Immigrants' Employment Outcomes over the Business Cycle~~~~
142~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
142~D1~T1~Time Period~2007-2009~"…by the time the unemployment rate peaked in October 2009, the number of unemployed persons had risen by 7.9 million since the ""Great Recession"" began in December 2007. All demographic groups experiecnced job losses during this time period, but some groups were more adversely affected than others. Repeating the pattern of most previous downturns, the recession's impact has been worst for low-education and minority workers."
142~D1~V1~Variable~Immigrant Status~…immigrants compose about 13% of the U.S. population and an even larger share -over 15% - of the labor force.
142~D1~V1~Variable~Immigrant Status~…immigrants are particularly sensitive to economic downturns because of their relatively low average skill levels. Immigrants make up almost two-fifths of workers who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent and three-quarters of workers who have completed at most eighth grade.
142~D1~V1~Variable~Immigrant Status~…over one-half of all U.S. immigrants and three-quarters of those who have not completed high school report that they cannot speak English very well. Immigrants also tend to have less social capital, or fewer connections and less about labor markets, than low-skilled natives. Such difficulties are compounded by a lack of legal status for some 8 million unauthorized immigrant workers in the United States.
142~D1~V1~Variable~Immigrant Status~…immigrants tend to be more mobile than natives, both geographically and across industries and occupations.
142~D1~T2~Time Period~1994-2009~…researchers use data from 1994 through the first half of 2009 to provide recent evidence on whether labor market outcomes are more sensitive among immigrants than among U.S. natives.
142~D1~V1~Variable~Immigrant Status~"…researchers use the terms ""immigrant"" and ""foreign-born"" interchangeably in this paper."
142~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all statistics presented in this paper are authors' calculations from Current Population survey outgoing rotation group data unless indicated otherwise.
142~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all data used here are from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) data. When examining the entire labor force, researchers include all individuals age 16 and older. When examining specific education groups, researchers include only individuals age 25 and older in order to capture completed education levels. Observations are weighted using the composite weights.
142~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Employment Rate~…the current research examines only employment and unemployment because there already is a relatively extensive wage-curve literature that examines the effect of macroeconomic conditions on earnings.
142~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the current research examines only employment and unemployment because there already is a relatively extensive wage-curve literature that examines the effect of macroeconomic conditions on earnings.
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~…researchers conduct both an aggregate analysis that examines trends and cycles in employment and unemployment rates and an individual-level analysis that examines the effect of the business cycle on employment outcomes, controlling for individual characteristics. For the aggregate analysis, researchers used the composite weights to create seasonally adjusted quarterly employment rates.
142~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Employment Rate~…for the aggregate analysis, researchers used the composite weights to create seasonally adjusted quarterly employment rates.
142~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…for the aggregate analysis, researchers used the composite weights to create seasonally adjusted quarterly employment rates.
142~D1~T2~Time Period~1994-2009~…viewed over the course of two expansions and two recessions, trends in immigrant and native employment and unemployment rates over the last 15 years provide insights into how these two groups fare over the business cycle.
142~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Employment Rate~…employment rates, which measure employed workers as a share of the noninstitutionalized civilian population, are typically procyclical.
142~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…unemployment rates, which measure the unemployed as a share of the labor force, are typically countercyclical.
142~D1~F1~Findings~Procyclicality of Immigrant vs. Native Employment Rates~…figures plotting the employment rates for immigrants and natives from the first quarter of 1994 through the second quarter of 2009 suggest that the immigrant employment rate is more procyclical than the native rate. The immigrant employment rate skyrocketed by over 4 percentage points during the 1990s boom while the native employment rate inched upward about 1 percentage point. Employment rates for both groups fell during the 2001 recession, but by 2003 the immigrant employment rate surpassed the native employment rate and remained consistently higher. The immigrant employment rate reached a series high of over 66% in early 2007, while the native employment rate never returned to its pre-2000 rates. Instead, it remained largely flat during the 2000s economic expansion and then fell with the onset of the recession in late 2007. Since then, the immigrant employment rate has fallen more precipitously than the native rate.
142~D1~F2~Findings~Procyclicality of Immigrant vs. Native Unemployment Rates~…figures plotting the unemployment rates for immigrants and natives from the first quarter of 1994 through the second quarter of 2009 suggest that the immigrant unemployment rate is more procyclical than the native unemployment rate. Duiring the 1990s exapnsion, the immigrant unemployment rate fell more than the native rate. After rising in the early 2000s, the immigrant unemployment rate fell to 3.4% in late 2006, its lowest point over the 15-year period. The native unemployment rate did not fall as much during the 2000s expansion and actually bottomed out at 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2000. The immigrant unemployment rate started rising earlier and faster than the native unemployment rate as the economy moved into the recession in late 2007.
142~D1~F3~Findings~Educational Attainment for Immigrants vs. Natives~…based on 2009 CPS data, roughly equal shares of adult natives have a high school diploma (32%), some college (28%), and a bachelor's degree or higher (30%). Only 10% have not completed high school. Immigrants are less likely to be in the middle of the education distribution; about 25% have a high school diploma and 15% some college.  In contrast, 30% of immigrants have no high school diploma, and 29% have a bachelor's degree or higher. Although educational attainment increased among both immigrants and natives during the last 15 years, natives have experienced a slightly faster pace of increase.
142~D1~F4~Findings~Employment Differentials Between Immigrants and Natives and Educational Attainment~…the most dramatic difference in employment and unemployment rates is between immigrants and natives who have not completed high school. CPS data shows that the employment rate among less-educated immigrants ranged between 50% and 60% during 1994 to 2009, over 20 percentage points higher than the employment rate among less-educated natives. Correspondingly, less-educated natives had higher unemployment rates than immigrants during the 2000s. These gaps widened during the housing boom, which benefited less-educated immigrants more than less-educated natives. Immigrants with a high school diploma but no college education also outperformed similarly educated natives in terms of employment during the 2000s.
142~D1~V2~Variable~Educational Attainment~…in order to compare employment and unemployment rate trends across varying levels of education.
142~V2~L1~Variable Value~No High School Diploma~…one of four educational categories specifying for no high school degree.
142~V2~L2~Variable Value~High School Diploma or Equivalent~…one of four educational categories specifying for a high school degree or the equivalent of such.
142~V2~L3~Variable Value~Some College~…one of four educational categories specifying for some college education.
142~V2~L4~Variable Value~Bachelor's Degree or Higher~…one of four educational categories specifying for a bachelor's degree or higher.
142~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses all occurred near business-cycle peaks and so do not provide the needed variation to study business-cycle effects.
142~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…composite weights are micro data weights that incorporate composite estimates based on the outgoing rotation groups in the monthly CPS data.
142~D1~V1~Variable~Immigrant Status~…a binary variable specifying for whether an individual is an immigrant or is native to the United States.
142~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…seasonally adjusted quarterly data for first quarter 1994 to second quarter 2009.
142~D1~F5~Findings~College Degree and Employment for Immigrants vs. Natives~…in the first half of 2009, college-educated immigrants averaged unemployment rates close to 6%, quite a bit higher than the 4% rate for college-educated natives, suggesting that college-graduate immigrants tend to have slightly lower employment rates and higher unemployment rates than similarly educated natives.
142~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data is decomposed into trend and cyclical components using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Researchers first compare the cyclical components, which are short-run fluctuations around the long-run trend of aggregate immigrant and native labor market outcomes by correlating them with quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
142~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~GDP Growth~…in order to decompose the data into trend and cyclical components, researchers first compare the cyclical components, which are short-run fluctuations around the long-run trend of aggregate immigrant and native labor market outcomes by correlating them with quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
142~D1~M1~Methodology~~…researchers examine the relationship between labor market outcomes and the business cycle in a regression framework with individual-level data.
142~D1~F6~Findings~Immigrant vs. Native Employment Rate Business Cycle Volatility~…estimates indicate that the immigrant employment rate experiences greater volatility than the native employment rate. The magnitude of the swings in the series is considerably larger for immigrants - the standard deviation of the cyclical component of the immigrant employment rate is 0.9 percentage points compared with 0.5 percentage points for natives. This greater volatility appears to be caused by greater sensitivity of immigrant employment to the business cycle.
142~D1~T3~Time Period~1996-1998~…a period categorized by economic booms.
142~D1~T4~Time Period~2000.0~…a period categorized by economic booms.
142~D1~T5~Time Period~2005-2007~…a period categorized by economic booms.
142~D1~T6~Time Period~2002.0~…a period categorized by economic busts.
142~D1~T7~Time Period~2008-2009~…a period categorized by economic busts.
142~D1~F7~Findings~Immigrant vs. Native Unemployment Rate Business Cycle Volatility~…when showing the cyclical component of the unemployment rates for natives and immigrants, the unemployment rate is found to be more volatile among immigrants than natives. The standard deviation of the cycle is larger for immigrants than for natives, at 0.9 percentage points for immigrants versus 0.6 percentage points for natives. These deviations are particularly large before and after recessions, the very high and low points of economic activity. Despite registering unemployment well above the long-term trend in the wake of the high-tech bust of 2001, the immigrant unemployment rate recovered quickly. The housing boom provided a notable boost to job opportunities among immigrant workers during the 2000s expansion.
142~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Correlation Between Quarter GDP Growth Rates and the Cyclical Component of the Employment Rate~…in order to examine the possibility that immigrant's labor market outcomes are more sensitive to swings in the business cycle, researchers present the simple correlation between quarterly GDP growth rates and the cyclical component of the employment rate series for immigrants and natives overall and by educational attainment.
142~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Correlation Between Quarter GDP Growth Rates and the Cyclical Component of the Unemployment Rate~…in order to examine the possibility that immigrant's labor market outcomes are more sensitive to swings in the business cycle, researchers present the simple correlation between quarterly GDP growth rates and the cyclical component of the unemployment rate series for immigrants and natives overall and by educational attainment.
142~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Correlation Between Quarter GDP Growth Rates and the Cyclical Component of the Unemployment Rate~…researchers focus on the cyclical component instead of the raw data because they are examining the correlation with GDP growth, not levels. Using detrended labor market outcomes is important in this comparison because the employment and unemployment trends among immigrants and natives are different over this period.
142~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Correlation Between Quarter GDP Growth Rates and the Cyclical Component of the Employment Rate~…researchers focus on the cyclical component instead of the raw data because they are examining the correlation with GDP growth, not levels. Using detrended labor market outcomes is important in this comparison because the employment and unemployment trends among immigrants and natives are different over this period.
142~D1~F8~Findings~GDP Growth and Cyclical Component of Employment Correlation~…the correlation between the GDP growth rate and the cyclical component of the employment rate for all immigrants is 0.26 versus 0.14 for natives.
142~D1~F9~Findings~GDP Growth and Cyclical Component of Employment Correlation by Education~…looking at the correlation between GDP growth and the cyclical component of the employment rate by education, the correlation is strongest among immigrants who do not have a high school diploma, at 0.32. The opposite is true among natives - the correlation between GDP growth and the cyclical component of the employment rate is weakest among the least-educated at 0.02. A similar pattern holds among college graduates, with the correlation between real GDP growth and the cyclical component of the employment rate more than twice as large among immigrants with a bachelor's degree or higher as among natives (0.24 and 0.11, respectively).
142~D1~F10~Findings~GDP Growth and Cyclical Component of Unemployment Correlation w/ and w/o Education~…the simple correlation between the real GDP growth rate and the cyclical component of the unemployment rate is -0.25 for immigrants and -0.22 for natives overall. However, the correlation is considerably stronger among immigrants who do not have a high school diploma than among natives (-0.22 and -0.12, respectively).
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~…researchers estimate a simple linear probability model of individual's labor market outcome (employment or unemployment status).
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~"…when examining employment, the dependent variable equals ""1"" for employed and ""0"" otherwise, and researchers include all individuals 16 and older in the population."
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~"…when examining unemployment, the dependent variable equals ""1"" for unemployed and ""0"" otherwise, and researchers only include individuals 16 and older in the labor force."
142~D1~V3~Variable~Employment Status~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the individual is employed and 0 otherwise.
142~D1~V4~Variable~Unemployment Status~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the individual is unemployed and 0 otherwise.
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~…researchers focus on the relationship between employment or unemployment status and one of two measures of the business cycle: the quarterly growth rate in real GDP or the quarterly growth rate in state real personal income. Only one measure is included in the regressions because of multicollinearity between the two variables.
142~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~GDP Growth~…the quarterly growth rate in real GDP
142~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~State-Level Income Growth~…the quarterly growth rate in state real personal income.
142~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~GDP Growth~…this measure captures the national business cycle.
142~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~State-Level Income Growth~…this measures captures changes in state-level macroeconomic conditions.
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~…researchers estimate the linear probability regressions for immigrants and natives overall and then by education. As with the aggregate analysis, the overall results include all individuals age 16 and older, while the education results only include individuals age 25 and older. In addition to a measure of the business cycle, the regressions include demographic variables, state dummy variables, a linear time trend and its square, and quarter dummy variables to control for any seasonal effects.
142~D1~V5~Variable~Female~…an indicator for females as a demographic variable included in linear probability regressions.
142~D1~V6~Variable~Quartic in Age~…a quartic in age as a demographic variable included in linear probability regressions.
142~D1~V7~Variable~State~…a series of state dummy variables included in linear probability regressions to control for state-specific trends.
142~D1~V8~Variable~Linear Time Trend~…a linear time trend as included in linear probability regressions.
142~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Linear Time Trend Squared~…a linear time trend squared as included in linear probability regressions.
142~D1~V9~Variable~Quarter Dummies~…quarter dummy variables included in linear probability regressions to control for any seasonal effects.
142~D1~F11~Findings~GDP Growth and Employment for Immigrants vs. Natives~…the effect of real GDP growth on employment is more than three times larger among all immigrants than among all natives (0.542 versus 0.166).
142~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the (unweighted) number of observations is 533,582 for immigrants and 4,208,618 for natives age 16 and older in the employment regressions (353,449 and 2,789,414, respectively, in the unemployment regressions).
142~D1~M1~Methodology~Linear Probability~…the (unweighted) number of observations is 533,582 for immigrants and 4,208,618 for natives age 16 and older in the employment regressions (353,449 and 2,789,414, respectively, in the unemployment regressions).
142~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~GDP Growth~…growth in GDP is calculated as the first difference of logged values.
142~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~State-Level Income Growth~…growth in personal income is calculated as the first difference of logged values.
142~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…researchers do not use unemployment rates as a measure of the business cycle sine they are mechanically related to the dependent variable in CPS data, particularly at the state level. The advantage of unemployment rates is that they are available monthly, unlike national GDP and state personal income.
142~D1~F12~Findings~GDP Growth and Unemployment for Immigrants vs. Natives~…in regards to unemployment, the effect of GDP growth is almost twice as large on all immigrants as on all natives (-0.665 versus -0.341). The fact that the immigrant-native difference is smaller for unemployment than for employment echoes the findings from the correlations. Nonetheless, the regressions do indicate that the employment and unemployment probabilities are more closely tied to the business cycle among immigrants than among natives overall.
142~D1~F13~Findings~GDP Growth and Employment for Immigrants vs. Natives by Education~"…among people who do not have a high school diploma, the effect of stronger GDP growth on employment is more than five times as large among immigrants as among natives (0.588 versus 0.115, with the latter not even statistically different from zero). Within each education group except the ""some college"" group, immigrants' labor market outcomes are more sensitve to the national business cycle."
142~D1~F14~Findings~GDP Growth and Unemployment for Immigrants vs. Natives by Education~…the sensitivity of unemployment likelihood to the state business cycle declines monotonically across education groups for both immigrants and natives. More-educated workers are less vulnerables to the business cycle in terms of unemployment prospects, regardless of their nativity.
143~143: Immigration and Wages: Evidence from the 1980's~~~~
143~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
143~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Market Effects of Immigration~…reseachers follow the standard approach to measuring the labor market effects of immigration by treating different cities within the United States as distinct labor markets, and comparing labor market outcomes across cities with higher and lower immigrant densities.
143~D1~V1~Variable~City~…reseachers track wages in 24 major cities during the period from 1979 with a sample including the 10 most immigrant-intensive cities identifiable in Current Population Survey microdata files, along with a group of 14 other cities.
143~D1~V1~Variable~City~…the 14 other cities were selcted by a variety of criteria, including stable boundaries, relatively large sample sizews and a desire fro geographic comparability with the high-immigrant cities.
143~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…microdata files used in order to derive a sample including the 10 most immigrant-intensive cities along with a group of 14 other cities selected by a variety of criteria, including stable boundaries, relatively large sample sizes, and a desire for geographic comparability with the high-immigrant cities.
143~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~...data from the 1980 Census on the characteristics of natives and recent immigrants (i.e. those who immigrated between 1975 and 1980) in the 24 cities of interest for this study.
143~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Recent Immigration Age, Education and Gender Trends~…recent immigrants are younger, less educated, and more likely to be male than natives or earlier immigrants.
143~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Recent Immigration Ethnicity Trends~..the proportion of hispanics is much higher among recent immigrants than in the native population.
143~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Education Distribution of Recent Immigrants~…the education distribution of newly arriving immigrants is relatively disperse: the fraction of college graduates is about the same as in the native population, but close to one-quarter of recent immigrants have less than an elementary education; as a result, recent immigrants make up 17% of the population in these cities with 6 or fewer years of schooling, and 10% of the population with less than an eighth-grade education.
143~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from this source is classified by whether or not the respondent was living in the United States 5 years earlier.
143~D1~T1~Time Period~1985.0~…relevant survey year of interest from which March Current Population Survey data is drawn.
143~D2~T2~Time Period~1980.0~…relevant survey year of interest from which Census data is drawn.
143~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Percent of Individuals Living Abroad 5-Years Prior that are Immigrants~…based on responses to a question in the 1980 Census, reseachers estimate that 85% of those living abroad 5 years ago are immigrants.
143~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Wage Gap Between New Arrivals and Other Workers~…there exists a 30% wage gap between the new arrivals and other workers, a gap that is very similar to that of recent immigrants and others in 1980.
143~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the relevant sample contains individuals age 16 to 68 years old in 24 cities.
143~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…the relevant sample contains individuals age 16 to 68 years old in 24 cities.
143~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Age~…the sample is limited to those 16 to 68 years old.
143~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Native Status~…a binary variable indicating whether or not an individual is a native to the United States.
143~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Recent Immigrants~…those individuals who arrived in the United States after March 1980.
143~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Recent Immigrant Percentage by City~…provides measurement on the perecent of recent immigrants in each city in 1980 and 1985.
143~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Population Growth Rate~…provides measurement on the overall population growth rate between 1980 and 1987.
143~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage Gap~…provides measurement on the wage gap between recent immigrants and natives in 1980.
143~D1, D2~F6~Findings~City Concentration of Recent Immigrants~…recent immigrants are highly concentrated in only a few cities, with New York, Los Angeles, and Miami accounting for 51% of recent immmigrants in both 1980 and 1985.
143~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Inflow Rates and Relative Wage Correlate~…a key correlate of both inflow rates and the relative wage of recent immigrants is the fraction of Hispanic immigrants, which ranges from under 10% in Detroit, Minneapolis, Seattle, and Portland to over one-half in cities in California and Texas.
143~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Immigration Inflow~…a natural assumption is that an inflow of new immigrants generates a proportional increase in the labor force and population of a city.
143~V1~L1~Variable Value~New York~…a city that had large immigrant inflows but a relatively modest growth rate during the 1980's.
143~V1~L2~Variable Value~Los Angeles~…a city that had large immigrant inflows but a relatively modest growth rate during the 1980's.
143~V1~L3~Variable Value~Miami~…a city that had large immigrant inflows but a relatively modest growth rate during the 1980's.
143~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Immigration Inflow~…in the absence of out-migration, an increase in the fraction of new immigrants will raise the population growth rate of a city point-for-point; therefore, if native inflow rates are independent of immigration rates, population growth rates should be linearly related to immigration inflow rates, with a slope of 1.0.
143~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable ~Population Growth Rate~…in the absence of out-migration, an increase in the fraction of new immigrants will raise the population growth rate of a city point-for-point; therefore, if native inflow rates are independent of immigration rates, population growth rates should be linearly related to immigration inflow rates, with a slope of 1.0.
143~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Regression Line Slope for 24 City Observations~…the slope of a regression line fitted to all 24 cities in the relevant data set is 1.04, with a standard error of 0.54.
143~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Regression Line Slope for 21 City Observations~…when a regression is fit to the subset of observations that excludes New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, however, the estimated slope is much higher at 2.76, with a standard error of 0.67, accounting for about one-half of the variation in growth rates in the subset of 21 cities; this finding suggests that in-migration flows during the 1980's were actually positively correlated with inflows of recent immigrants to all but the 3 most immigrant-intensive cities.
143~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…a regression line fitted to all 24 cities in the relevant data set.
143~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…subsequent specifications of this estimation method exclude New York, Los Angeles, and Miami.
143~V1~L1~Variable Value~New York~…it should be noted that New York had large immigrant inflows during the 1970's and grew more slowly than most other United States cities between 1970 and 1980.
143~V1~L2~Variable Value~Los Angeles~…it should be noted that New York had large immigrant inflows during the 1970's and grew more slowly than most other United States cities between 1970 and 1980.
143~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from the merged files of the 12 monthly Current Population Survey administered in 1979, 1980, 1988 and 1989 used to examine wage outcomes in different cities during the past decade; wage data pertains to hourly wage rates or the ratio of average weekly earnings to average weekly hours for salaried workers.
143~D1~T3~Time Period~1979-1980~…relevant survey years from which Current Population Survey wage outcome data was drawn.
143~D1~T4~Time Period~1988-1989~…relevant survey years from which Current Population Survey wage outcome data was drawn.
143~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…pertains to hourly wage rates for hourly rated workers or the ratio of average weekly earnings to average weekly hours for salaried workers.
143~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…for each city and each year, researchers calculate the 10th and 90th percentiles of the log wage distribution.
143~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…the distribution of hourly wages in each city is approximately lognormal, although the distributions contain prominent spikes at points like $3.00, $5.00, and $10.00 per hour, while the spread between the 10th and the 90th percentile of log wages in any city tends to be strictly proportional to the estimated standard deviation, as is the case for a normal distribution.
143~D1~T3~Time Period~1979-1980~…years in which a binding national wage floor was implemented that served the 10th percentile of wages in many cities.
143~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Mean Log Wages Across Cities vs. Individual Wage Variation Across Cities~…despite the differences in mean log wages across cities, however, 97% of the overall variation in individual wages for workers in the relevant sample of cities is within-city variation.
143~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Mean Log Wages and CPI Growth~…mean log wages in most cities grew at roughly the same rate as the Consumer Price Index, which rose 44% between 1979 to 1980 and 1988 to 1989; however,  mean log wages in Detroit, Houston and New Orleans, however, grew much more slowly than average consumer prices, while those in New York grew faster.
143~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Upper Tail Earnings Distributions~…in every city except Washington, D.C., wage rates in the upper tail of the earnings distribution grew more quickly than those in the lower tail; thus the growth in wage inequality during the 1980's (Chinhui Juhn et al., 1989) was almost entirely due to an increase in the within-city variance.
143~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Immigration and Wage Distribution Percentiles~…contrary to expectations, the data suggests that higher immigration is associated with more rapid increases in the 90th percentile of wages, rather than with any relative decline in the 10th percentile of wages.
143~D1, D2, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Wage Changes Relative to COL Indexes~…a measure of wage changes relative to city-specific cost-of-living indexes used in order to test the possiblity that increases in the cost of living lead to wage increases for high-wage workers.
143~D3~D3~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics~…source of cost-of-living indexes, which are available for most the cities in the sample of interest.
143~D1, D2, D3~F14~Findings~COL and Recent Immigrants~…as hypothesized, the change in the city-specific cost of living is positively correlated with the fraction of recent immigrants in 1985; adjusting for changes in the local cost of living, the change in the 90th prcentile of wages is still postiviely related to the fraction of recent immigrants but the regression coefficient is halved and falls to statistical insignificance, while adjusting for the local cost of living causes the regression coefficient relating  the changes in the 10th percentile of wages to the fraction of recent immigrants in 1985 to become slightly negative. Thus, adjusting for city-specific changes in the cost of living, researchers find less evidence of a positive correlation between immigration rates and the growth of high-skilled wages, and more evidence of a negative correlation between immigration and the growth of low-skilled wages (it is important to note that neither of these correlations are large or statistically significant).
143~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Immigration and Low-Skill Wages~…in no case do researchers find a large or statistically significant effect of immigration on the rate of increase of wages for the least-skilled workers.
144~144: Immigration, Remittances and Business Cycles~~~~
144~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
144~D2, D3, D4, D5~F11~Findings~Low Sunk Cost and Remittances~...with the lower sunk cost, remittances become less correlated with foreign output (-0.14 with the low sunk cost vs. -0.23 with the high sunk cost), since the wage gap between the home market and the foreign market declines, thus reducing the need for remittances as a compensation mechanism.
144~D2, D3, D4~F12~Findings~Low Sunk Cost and Immigrant Wage/Total Remittance~…with the low sunk cost, the standard deviations of immigrant wage and total remittance are 1.19 and 1.67, respectively, while with the high sunk cost, the standard deviations of the immigrant wage and total remittances rise to 1.49 and 1.91. In summary, as migration barriers restrict the ability of the stock of immigrant labor to adjust over the cylce, its factor payments and the associated remittances become more volatile.
144~D2, D3, D5~F2~Findings~Remittance Flows and Relative Economic Performance~…when the pattern of remittances from the United States to Mexico is plotted against the relative performances of these economies, it is found that larger outflows of remittances to Mexico occur during periods with faster United States economic growth (or lower Mexican growth). The results are even stronger when remittances are compared with the relative wage across the two economies
144~D1, D3, D5~F1~Findings~Border Apprehensions and GDP Ratio~…when the number border apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border is plotted against the GDP ratio for U.S and Mexico measured in purchasing power, the chart shows that periods in which the United States economy outperformed that of Mexico generally were accompanied by an increase in the number of border apprehensions.
144~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~F23~Findings~Shocks, Low Sunk Cost and Household Gain by Labor Type~…when shocks are added to the second-order approximation model, the gain of the skilled and the loss of the unskilled are 5.2% and -43.5%, respectively; the skilled can compensate the unskilled and obtain even larger net welfare gains of (3.8%). This net weflare gain emerges under the assumption that unskilled natives and immigrants are perfect substitutes. The results suggest that, with higher barriers to immigration, the loss arising from the slow adjustment of the unskilled labor input to shocks more than offsets the gain arising from shielding the native unskilled from the inflows to migrant labor in the home market.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…when financial autarky is assumed, labor migration is an immigrant's only insurance mechanism.

144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…unskilled workers lack a high school degree.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…unskilled laborers can migrate from Foreign to Home.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV44~Derived variable~Current Account Balance~…under financial integration, the current account balance for the home market (the trade balance pus financial investment income minus the outflow of remittances) equals the negative of the financial account (the change in bond holdings.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…under financial integration, researchers replace the balanced current account condition from the model with financial autarky with the expression for the balance of international payments which shows that the current account balance must equal the negative of the financial account balance.
144~D2~DV41~Derived Variable~Remittances Per Unit~…to highlight the intensive and extensive margins of remittances at the household level, remittances per unit of migrant labor are computed.
144~D1, D3, D4~T2~Time Period~1995-2006~…time period through which real hourly wage data was drawn for United States unskilled workers and Mexico's maquiladora workers in order to compute the elasticity of remittances to the U.S.-Mexico unskilled wage gap.

144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…this model, in which the investment in migration and the migrant labor income are part of a unified budget constraint, allows to model labor migration as an inter-temporal decision of the unskilled household. However, since the household maximzes utility as a single agent, one cannot treat emigrants and non-emigrants as separate entities that choose how much to consume, work and remit independently from each other.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…this model is used to show historical contributions of shocks to growth of key variables over the sample period.

The model is also evaluated using data on apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border and workers' remittances to Mexico.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…this model is estimated using Bayesian techniques with data on border enforcement and macroeconomic indicators from the United States and Mexico.

144~D3~DV37~Derived Variable~Foreign Skill Premium~…the wage of skill foreign market laborers divided by the wage of unskilled foreign market laborers.
144~D4, D6~V6~Variable~Consumption~…the volatility of unskilled consumption decreases for lower values of the sunk emigration cost; this decrease is notably steeper in the baseline case with the unskilled in financial autarky than in the alternative case when they trade bonds.
144~D4, D5, D6~F17~Findings~Volatility of Unskilled Consumption and Sunk Costs~…the volatility of unskilled consumption declines for lower values of the sunk emigration cost; furthermore, unskilled consumption is notably more volatile than than output under financial autarky.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV12~Derived Variable~Unskilled Budget Constraint~…the unskilled households, which does not trade bonds, is subect to a budget constraint contingent on the equilibrium wage for unskilled labor, the gross rental rate of the capital owned by unskilled households and the capital and investment holdings by the unskilled household.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility~…the unskilled household in the foreign market, which does not trade bonds but invests in migration, maximizes lifetime utility from foreign consumption and the foreign labor supply dependent on the unskilled wage, and the total income from hours worked by the non-emigrant unskilled labor in the foreing market.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~F14~Findings~Skill Premium and Unskilled immigrant Entry/Home-Foreign Output Ratio~…the unconditional correlations implied by the model are consistent with those in the data. The correlation between the skill premium and unskilled immigrant entry in the home market is positive (0.31). In addition, the skill premium is positively correlated with the Home-Foreign output ratio (0.18) and with home output (0.52), as in the data; one exception is the correlation with foreign output, which is also positive (0.33).
144~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey is the source for hours worked and hourly wages (in nominal dollars) for the U.S. skilled and unskilled workers.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV44~Derived Variable~Current Account Balance~…the trade balance plus financial investment income minus remittances.
144~D3, D6~DV19~Derived Variable~Total Labor Supply~…the total labor supply of the skilled households is equal to the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average labor supply, whereas the total labor supply of the unskilled households is equal to the one minus the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average labor supply.
144~D3, D6~DV21~Derived Variable~Total Investment~…the total investment of the skilled households is equal to the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average investment, whereas the total investment of the unskilled households is equal to the one minus the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average investment.

144~D3, D6~DV18~Derived Variable~Total Consumption~…the total consumption of the skilled households is equal to the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average consumption rate, whereas the total consumption of the unskilled households is equal to the one minus the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average consumption rate.
144~D3, D6~DV20~Derived Variable~Total Capital~…the total capital of the skilled households is equal to the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average capital, whereas the total capital of the unskilled households is equal to the one minus the supply of skilled workers multiplied by the average capital.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…the sunk emigration cost is a friction that renders the stock of immigrant labor a state variable unable to adjust immediately to shocks and, as a result, the gap between the immigrant and foreign wages varies over the business cycle, and migrants and non-migrants obtain either a net suplus or a loss relative to the steady-state allocation of consumption.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…the sunk cost reflects the intensity of border enforcement, and also includes the cost of searching for employment, adjusting to a new lifestyle and transportation expenditures. In the special case of undocumented immigration, the sunk cost includes the cost of hiring human smugglers as well as the physical risk and legal implications of illegally crossing the boarder.
144~D2~DV41~Derived Variable~Remittances Per Unit~…the steady-state amount of remittances per unit of immigrantlabor is equal to the difference between the immigrant wage and immigrant consumption (express in units of the composite good in the home market).
144~D4, D5, D6~DV11~Derived Variable~Skilled Budget Constraint~…the skilled household, which trades bonds internationally, faces a budget constraint contingent on the wage of skilled labor, the gross rental rate of the capital owned by skilled households, the capital and investment of the skille households, the rates of return of home and foreing bonds, the principal and interest from home and foreign bonds expressed in units of the home composite good, the real exchange rate, and the adjustment cost rebated to the skilled households. The cost parameter is necessary to avoid non-stationarity of the stock of liabilities.

144~D1, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Foreign Labor Supply~…the skilled household in the foreign market has preferences over the labor supply similar to those of the skilled household in the home market.
144~D3~DV31~Derived Variable~Foreign Consumption~…the skilled household in the foreign market has preferences over consumption similar to those of the skilled household in the home market.
144~D4, D5, D6~V4~Variable~Skill Premium~…the skill premium is the ratio of the average hourly wage of workers with 12 or more years of schooling (weighted by population) to the average hourly wage of workers with less than 12 years of schooling.
144~D4, D5, D5~V4~Variable~Skill Premium~…the skill premium in the destination economy is procyclical and positively correlated with the inflows of migrant unskilled labor, which dampen the unskilled wage during expansions.
144~D3, D5~DV25~Derived Variable~Share of Unskilled Labor~…the share of unskilled labor in prdouction as used in determining the home production function.

144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…the scarcity of immigrant labor during boom times reduces capital accumulation and dampens labor productivity in the destination economy. During recessions, the opposite effect occurs: due to the barriers to labor migration, established immigrants are deterred from returning to their country of origin, placing additional downward pressure on the wage of the native unskilled workers.
144~D6~V13~Variable~Rate of Return of Home Bonds~…the rate of return on home bonds as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.
144~D3~V14~Variable~Rate of Return of Foreign Bonds~…the rate of return on foreign bonds as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.

144~D3~V25~Variable~Foreign Production~…the profit maximization problem of the firm generates optimality conditions for factor prices.
144~D1, D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Probability of Return~…the probability of return plays a significant role in determining emigration incentives, with approximately 70% of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States returning home within ten years.
144~D1, D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Probability of Return~…the probability of a return-inducing exogenous shock that forces immigrant workers to return to their country of origin, i.e. the foreign market. This shock occurs at the end of every time period, and reflects issues such as termination of employment in the destination economy, likelihood of deportation, or voluntary returns to the country of origin.
144~D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Principal and Interest of Foreign Bonds~…the principal and interst from foreign bonds expressed in units of the home composite good as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.
144~D6~DV13~Derived Variable~Principal and Interest of Home Bonds~…the principal and interest from home bonds expressed in units of the home composite good as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.

144~D3~V20~Variable~Price of Foreign Goods~…the price of the foreign goods expressed in units of the home consumption basket.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…the pool of native unskilled labor in the home and foreign market is defined to include the labor force with less than a high school degree.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the number of data series used in the estimation cannot exceed the number of structural shocks in the model.
144~D1~V2~Variable~Border Apprehensions~…the number of apprehensions of the U.S.-Mexico border, a measure which the existing literature uses as a proxy for attempted illegal crossings of unskilled labor into the United States.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…the native unskilled and immigrant unskilled labor are perfect substitutes.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Second-Order Approximation~…the model proposed in this research attempts to bridge an existing gap between the international macroeconomics literature and immigration theory. In contrast to the former, the model allows for labor mobility across countries. In contrast to the latter, it explains the business cycle dynamics and the transmission of aggregate shocks across countries in the presence of labor migration and remittances.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the model is representative of a standard two-country setup  (Home and Foreign) along the lines of Backus et al. (1994). The novel characteristic for the current research is the presence of labor mobility and remittances. Researchers introduce two types of labor in each country, while assuming capital-skill complementarity in production as in Krusell et al. (2000). The unskiled labor can migrate from Foreign to Home, and migrant workers send a fraction of their income as remittances back to the country of origin every period.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the model generates a countercyclical trade balance with countercyclical migration outflows, since during downturns the foreign skilled households invest in bonds overseas while the unskilled households invest in labor migration.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the methods used in this research bridge an existing gap between international macroeconomics and immigration theory. In the current model, the unskilled labor can emigrate subject to a sunk cost.
144~D1, D4, D5~F4~Findings~Sunk Migration Costs~…the mean for the sunk migration cost, 4.73, is significantly higher than its prior, indicating that the sunk cost per unit of emigrant labor is equivalent to the immigrant labor income obtained over five quarters in the destination economy.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the likelihood and the prior permit a computation of the posterior that can be used as the starting value of the random walk version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorith, which is a Monte Carlo method used to generate draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters. In this case, the results reported are based on 500,000 draws following this algorithm. 
144~D1, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Foreign Labor Supply~…the labor supply of the foreign skilled and unskilled households are aggregated like in the home market.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the Kalman smoothing procedure is applied to reconstruct historical contributions of shocks to the labor migration flows as a latent variable.
144~D6~V12~Variable~Investment~…the investments owned by unskilled households as used in determining the budget constrains of unskilled households.
144~D6~V12~Variable~Investment~…the investment owned by skilled households as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.

144~D3~V23~Variable~Foreign Investment~…the investment of skilled and unskilled households in the foreign market.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility~…the infinitely-lived representative agent maximizes the intertemporal utility subject to the gross rental rate of capital, the rates of return of home and foreign bonds, and the principal and interest income from holdings of the home and foreign bonds, the costs of adjusting holdings of the home and foreign bonds, and the fee rebate.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…the increase in the sunk emigration cost leads to a decline in the arrivals and the stock of immigrant labor, which in turn generates a gradual decline in the capital stock in the home market. This translates into lower home output and aggregate consumption. However, the wage of established immigrants benefits from this policy. As foreign workers are deterred from emigrating to the home market, the resident labor supply in the foreing market becomes relatively abundant, and the foreign unskilled wage falls. The cheaper labor input encourages capital accumulation and enhances output in the foreign market.
144~D1, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Emigration Decision~…the incentive to emigrate depends on the expectation of future earnings at the destination relative to the country of origin, on the perceived sunk cost of emigration, and on the return probability of immigrant.
144~D3, D4, D5~DV46~Derived Variable~Impulse Responses~…the impulse responses to an unexpected 1% increase in home productivity for each scenario is computed using the posterior median of the estimated parameters (with the exception of sunk costs) and plotted as percent deviations from the steady state.
144~D1, D3~V28~Variable~Emigration Decision~…the households' decision to emigrate is endogenous, and involves an inter-temporal trade-off between the sunk emigration cost and the wage benefits from labor migration.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV23~Derived Variable~Home Intermediate Good Use~…the home intermediate good is ued both domestically and abroad.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Home Economy~…the home economy includes a continuum of two types of infinitely lived households of relative sizes, which supply units of skilled and unskilled labor. Each of the two representative households maximizes lifetime utility as a function of consumption and labor supply.
144~D6~V17~Variable~Gross Rental Rate~…the gross rental rate of the capital owned by unskilled households as used in determing the budget constraints of unskilled households.
144~D6~V17~Variable~Gross Rental Rate~…the gross rental rate of the capital owned by skilled households used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.
144~D3~V24~Variable~Foreign Gross Rental Rate~…the gross rental rate of capital in the foreign market.
144~D3, D6~DV1~Derived Variable~GDP Ratio~…the GDP ratio between the United States and Mexico measured in purchasing power parity terms.

144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Second-Order Approximation~…the framework used in this research allows the examination of the macroeconomic effects of border enforcement, as well as the insurance role of migration and remittances as a substitute for cross-border financial flows in diversifying from country-specific risk and smoothing consumption in the country of origin.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…the foreign unskilled households do not trade bonds, but have migration and remittances as an insurance mechanism that substitutes for bond trading.
144~D3~DV35~Derived Variable~Foreign Production~…the foreign production is dependent on a neutral technology shcoks, the amount of unskilled labor that works in the foreign market, a function of capital and skille foreign labor.
144~D3, D6~V7~Variable~Labor Type~…the foreign economy consists of a continuum of skilled and unskilled households of relative sizes.
144~D3~V21~Variable~Foreign Good~…the foreign composite good incorporates amounts of the foreign and home-specific goods.
144~D3~V21~Variable~Foreign Good~…the foreign composite good can be consumed by the non-emigrant foreign labor (which excludes the unskilled emigrants established in thehome market), invested in physical capital, and used for investment in migration (to cover the sunk cost of sending new emigrant labor abroad).
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…the flows of unskilled labor migration have direct implications for the skill premium in the destination economy.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…the flow of remittances per unit of labor increases notably as sunk costs decrease to compensate for the wage differences between the home market and the foreign market.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…the flow of remittances is treated as a latent variable in the estimated model, and compares their estimated moments to those from the actual data to assess the model fit.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the flow of remittances and new emigrant labor are treated as a latent variables in the estimated model, and compares their estimated moments to those from the actual data to assess the model fit.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…the flow of new emigrant labor is treated as a latent variable in the estimated model, and compares their estimated moments to those from the actual data to assess the model fit.
144~D3, D6~F5~Findings~Degree of Substitution Between the U.S. and Mexico~…the estimated mean values, 2.34 and 1.62, are higher than their priors, indicating a larger degree of substitution between the United States and Mexican goods, and a labor supply elasticity that is closer to the microeconomic estimates.
144~D4~V16~Variable~Equilibrium Wage for Unskilled Labor~…the equilibrium wage for unskilled labor as used in determining the budget constraints of unskilled households.
144~D2~DV43~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Remittances~…the elasticity of remittances to the U.S.-Mexico unskilled wage gap is obtained from a reduced form estimation over 1995:Q1 to 2006:Q3, using real hourly wage data for United States unskilled workers (less than high school degree) and Mexico's maquiladora workers.
144~D2~DV43~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Remittances~…the elasticity of average remittances with respect to relative wages depends on the amount of lump-sum funds, and thus characterizes the thrust of the altruistic motive.
144~D3, D4~DV40~Derived Variable~Immigrant Wage and Unskilled Wage Difference~…the difference between the immigrant wage in the home market and the unskilled wage in the foreign market expressed in units of the foreign consumption basket.
144~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data series are annualized, expressed in natural logs, and de-trended using a band-pass filter that removes fluctuations accruing in periods shorter than 4 and longer than 25. The model predictions receive a similar treatment. This approach is appropriate not only for the skill premium but also for border apprehensions, which present sizable short-term swings due to the random nature of border arrests.
144~D5~D5~Dataset~Census~…the data is seasonally adjusted with the X-12 ARIMA method of the U.S. Census Bureau.
144~D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Adjustment Cost for Foreign Bonds~…the cost parameter, included in calculating this measure, is necessary to avoid non-stationarity of the stock of liabilities, but is set close to zero (0.0025) to avoid altering the high-frequency dynamics of the model.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV15~Derived Variable~Adjustment Cost for Home Bonds~…the cost parameter, included in calculating this measure, is necessary to avoid non-stationarity of the stock of liabilities, but is set close to zero (0.0025) to avoid altering the high-frequency dynamics of the model.
144~D1, D3, D4~F13~Findings~Apprehensions and Skill Premium in Growth Rates~…the correlation between apprehensions and the United States skill premium in growth rates is 0.37. In addition, the United States skill premium is correlated positively with the U.S.-Mexico GDP ratio (0.49), positively with the United States GDP (0.12), and negatively with Mexico's GDP (-0.45). One interpretation of this result is that, when the United States economy outperforms Mexico's, the arrival of unskilled workers places downward pressure on the unskilled wage, thus increasing the skill premium.
144~D3~DV31~Derived Variable~Foreign Consumption~…the consumption of the foreign skilled and unskilled households are aggregated like in the home market.
144~D3, D6~V30~Variable~Financial Account Balance~…the change in bond holdings.
144~D6~V11~Variable~Capital~…the capital owned by unskilled households as used in determining the budget constraints of unskilled households.
144~D6~V11~Variable~Capital~…the capital owned by skilled households as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.

144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the Bayesian estimation technique uses a general equilibrium approach that addresses the identification problems of reduced form models. It is a system-based analysis that fits the solved dynamic stochastic general equilbrium model to a vector of aggregate time series.
144~D3~DV36~Derived Variable~Foreign Unskilled Labor Supply~…the amount of unskilled labor that works in the foreign market.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…the alternative model in which all households are in financial autarky (not only the unskilled) would generate moments for labor migration and remittances that are similar to those from the baseline model. The only difference concerns Mexico's trade balance, which would be pro-cyclical with the Mexican GDP, thus contradicting the empirical evidence of counter-cyclical trade balances in emergin market economies.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV15~Derived Variable~Adjustment Cost for Home Bonds~…the adjustment costs for home country bond holdings as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.
144~D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Adjustment Cost for Foreign Bonds~…the adjustment costs for foreign country bond holdings as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.
144~D3, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Adjustment Cost to Skilled Households~…the adjustment cost rebated to the skilled households as used in determining the budget constraints of skilled households.
144~D1~V5~Variable~Border Patrol hours~…stricter border enforcement reduces the volatility of the stock of immigrant labor, and increases the volatility of the immigrant wages and remittances.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…stricter border enforcement reduces the volatility of the stock of immigrant labor, and increases the volatility of the immigrant wages and remittances.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…some parameters are fixed in the estiatmion to adress identification issues: the share of unskilled labor is set at 0.08 in the home market and 0.75 in the foreign market, the quarterly exit rate of immigrant labor is set at 0.07, and other standard parameters are equal to 0.99, 0.025, 0.85 and 0.75, respectively, allowing for slightly more trade openness for the smaller foreign economy.
144~V7~L2~Variable Value~Skilled~…skilled workers hold a high school degree or higher.
144~V7~L2~Variable Value~Skilled~…skilled households can fully compensate the unskilled and still obtain a net welfare gain.
144~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…since the sample group in this survey rotates every month, the skill premium is noisy at the quarterly frequency. To address this problem, the Current Population Survey data used to analyze the cyclical dynamics of the skill premium is annualized, like in Polgreen and Silos (2009).
144~D3~DV33~Derived Variable~Foreign Utility~…since the household maximzes utility as a single agent, one cannot treat emigrants and non-emigrants as separate entities that choose how much to consume, work and remit independently from each other.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility~…since the household maximzes utility as a single agent, one cannot treat emigrants and non-emigrants as separate entities that choose how much to consume, work and remit independently from each other.
144~D3~V21~Variable~Foreign Good~…since home and foreign goods are imperfect substitutes, the demand for the foreign good is always positive, and foreign labor is always required for production in the foreign market.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Second-Order Approximation~…second-order approximation around the deterministic steady state is used to compare outcomes for two counterfactual scenarios, with a very low sunk cost (1) and a relatively high sunk cost (6) with the estimated model (4.73).
144~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers used monthly data for total hours worked in the last week of every month, weekly earnings before deductions, and earnings weights by educational attainment.
144~D3, D6~V7~Variable~Labor Type~…researchers introduce two types of labor (skilled and unskilled) in each country, assuming capital-skill complementarity in production as in Krusell et al. (2000).
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…researchers introduce cross-border mobility for the unskilled household in the foreign market, whose members have the option to work in the home market for a higher wage than in the foreign market, but subject to a sunk emigration cost.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV43~Derived Variable~Steady State Welfare Effects~…researchers compute the steady-state welfare effects by turning off all aggregate shocks and alternatively computing the static and dynamic effects together by incorporating the estimated stochastic shocks for each scenario.
144~D1~DV45~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Border Enforcement Correlations~…researchers compute counterfactual correlations for low and high border enforcement, using the posterior median of the estimated parameters while altering only the sunk emigration cost (which takes values 1 and 6).
144~D2~D2~Dataset~Bank of Mexico~…researchers choose to use data on apprehensions (arrests) at the U.S.-Mexico border and remittances from the United States to Mexico in real pesos to evaluate the model, but do not include these series in the structural estimation, for several reasons: first, the apprehensions series is noisy due to the random nature of border arrests; second, is an identification problem regarding the effect of border enforcement on apprehensions; third, remittances are not included in the structural estimation, given the short length of this series (available only since 1995:Q1.
144~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service~…researchers choose to use data on apprehensions (arrests) at the U.S.-Mexico border and remittances from the United States to Mexico in real pesos to evaluate the model, but do not include these series in the structural estimation, for several reasons: first, the apprehensions series is noisy due to the random nature of border arrests; second, is an identification problem regarding the effect of border enforcement on apprehensions; third, remittances are not included in the structural estimation, given the short length of this series (available only since 1995:Q1.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…researchers choose a normal jump distribution with covariance matrix equal to the Hessian of the posterior density evaluated at the maximum. The scale factor is chosen in order to deliver an acceptance rate between 30% and 45% depending on the run of the algorithm.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…researchers build a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which allows for endogenous labor migration and remittances. To account for skill heterogeneity among the native labor, the model features two types of labor (skilled and unskilled) in each country, under the assumption that capital and skilled labor are relative complements.
144~D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…researchers assume that immigrant workers base the relative wage forecast on a noisy signal that is worker-specific
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…reports the unconditional theoretical moments and compares them to their empirical counterparts and the standard-deviations and first-order autocorrelations for border apprehensions, remittances, border patrol hours, and the Mexican trade balance normalized by GDP.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…reports the theoretical moments, indicating the medians from the simulated distributions of moments, using the samples generated with parameter draws from the posterior distribution. In general, the model delivers volatility and persistence values that are fairly close to those in the data. The model does not match the high volatility of remittances and the persistence of border enforcement, despite the high persistence of enforcement shocks in the estimation. However, the model captures particularly well the comovement of labor migration and remittances with the relative economic performance of the United States and Mexico.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…reports the posterior mean, mode, and standard deviation obtained from the Hessian, along with the 90% probabiity interval of the structural parameters.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…reports the estimation results for the model with financial integration, using the data in deviations from a cubic trend.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…reports the correlations of each of the four data series with the U.S.-Mexico real GDP ratio, the United States real GDP and Mexico's real GDP adjusted by the bilateral real exchange rate (thus expressed in real dollars).
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…reports impulse responses to all shocks including neutral technology, demand, and investment in either the home or foreign market.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…remittances represent an altruisitic compensation mechanism between immigrant and resident workers.
144~D2~DV41~Derived Variable~Remittances Per Unit~…remittances per worker can be expressed as an increasing function of relative wages.
144~D2, D3, D6~F9~Findings~Remittances and Total Home Output/Foreign Output~…remittances are positively correlated with home output, and negatively correlated with foreign output. The correlations of border enforcement are close to zero, as in the data. Finally the model matches well the negative correlation between Mexico's trade balance and GDP.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…remittances are converted to real dollars using the United States CPI index, and then in real Mexican pesos using the U.S.-Mexico bilateral real exchange (obtained from the IMF's International Financial Statistics.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…remittances act as a consumption-smoothing mechanism for the foreign unskilled households.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…remittance data from the data series are not included in the structural estimation, given the short length of this series.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~T1~Time Period~1980-2004~…relevant survey from which data is drawn from the relevant data series for the United States and Mexico from 1980:Q1 to 2004:Q3.
144~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service~"…relevant figures in this data set include ""border linewatch apprehensions"" and ""border linewatch enforcement hours""."
144~D3, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Labor Supply~…relative sizes of households which supply units of skilled and unskilled labor.
144~D3, D6~V26~Variable~Net Foreign Assets~…quadratic costs of adjustment for bond holdings ensure the stationarity of net foreign assets.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV22~Derived Variable~Home Production~…production in home is a nested CES aggregate dependent on a function in which native and immigrant unskilled labor enter as perfect substitutes, a function of capital and skilled native labor, the share of unskilled labor in production, the share of capital in output and the relative productivity of the skilled compared with unskilled labor.
144~D1, D3, D6~F25~Findings~Low Sunk Costs vs. High Sunk Costs~…overall, the net gains in both countries indicate that lowering the migration barriers results in a global Pareto improvement. On the contrary, when the sunk cost is raised to 6, the welfare effects for both unskilled and skilled workers are reversed, but the Pareto improvements does not hold. Neither the unskilled in the home market nor the skilled in the foreign market can compensate for the losses of their domestic counterparts and obtain net gains from the increase in migration barriers.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…over the business cycle, workers decide to send remittances one period before; this decision depends on the relative wage forecast computed one period in advance.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…on the spending side, emigration requires a sunk cost of immigrant labor, which is equal to a specific number of units of the foreign composite good.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~F6~Findings~Shock Effects~…note that border enforcement shocks are persistent and volatile (p-value = 0.99, standard deviation = 0.05), and also that the neutral and investment-specific technology innovations are less persistent and more volatile in Mexico than in the United States.
144~D1, D3, D6~F10~Findings~Low Sunk Cost and Labor Migration~…notably, when the sunk cost is lowered to 1, the labor migration flows become more responsive to business cycles: the correlation of migration flows with the GDP ratio is 0.55 with the low sunk cost vs. 0.35 with the high sunk cost. In particular, they become more correlated with output in Home. 
144~D1, D4~F18~Findings~Immigrant Labor Stock and Sunk Costs~…notably, the stock of immigrant labor increases relatively less under the higher sunk cost when an unexpected 1% increase in home productivity occurs. In turn, the relative scarcity of immigrant labor causes the immigrant wage in the home market to increase more. Therefore, as the foreign household attempts to smooth consumption across members residing in both countries, the amount of remittances per immigrant worker increases by more in the model with the higher sunk cost. In the foreign market, the unskilled wage increases by less in the scenario with the higher sunk migration cost. The result is due to the larger fraction of unskilled labor that remains in the foreing market when emigration is more costly, which in turn enhances capital accumulation and output. In summary, a less flexible immigration policy reflected by a larger sunk migration cost enhances the volatility of the native unskilled wage, the immigrant wage and remittances per unit of  immigrant labor in response to productivity shocks.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~F3~Findings~Posterior Means of Elasticity of Substitution Between Capital and Skilled and Capital and Unskilled Labor~…notably, the posterior means of the elasticity of substitution between capital and skilled and capital and unskilled labor are closer to each other (0.91 and 0.94) than in the prior distributions despite the tight prior, slightly weakening the implied capital-skill complementarity.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…migrant workers send a fraction of their income as remittances back to the country of origin every period.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Substitution Between Capital and Unskilled Labor~…measures the elasticity of substitution between capital and unskilled labor, which is the same as the elasticity of substition between capital and unskilled labor, which is the same as the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV29~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Substitution Between Capital and Skilled labor~…measures the elasticity of substitution between capital and skilled labor. 
144~D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…measured as the ratio between the real wage of unskilled workers in the United States (who lack a high school degree) and workers in export assembly plant in Mexico.
144~D6~D6~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…macroeconomic data on real output, consumption and investment is provided, for the United States, by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
144~D3~D3~Dataset~INEGI~…macroeconomic data on real output, consumption and investment is provided, for Mexico, by the INEGI through Haver Analytics.
144~D1, D3, D6~F22~Findings~Low Sunk Cost and Household Gain by Labor Type~…lowering the sunk cost to 1 generates a steady-state gain for the skilled households and a loss for the unskilled (4.2% and -32.5% of the consumption stream, respectively). On the net, the skilled households can fully compensate the loss of the unskilled (who represent a small fraction of the population) through direct transfers, and still obtain a net sizable gain (3.2%) after the policy change.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…lowering the restrictions to unskilled labor migration has asymmetric welfare effects on the skilled and unskiled households in the destination economy; however, the welfare gain from loosening the border (due in part to the faster adjustment of the unskilled labor input over the cycle) outweights the loss arising as the native unskilled labor becomes more exposed to immigration flows. The skilled households can fully compensate the unskilled and still obtain a net welfare gain.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…lowering the barriers to unskilled migration has asymmetric welfare effects on the skilled and unskilled households in the destination economy.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…labor migration is sizeable and has a significant economic impact on the economies involved; this level migration varies over the business cycle.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…labor migration is a particularly useful tool to smooth consumption under financial autarky: when the sunk migration cost is reduced, the volatility of unskilled consumption falls more steeply under financial autarky, when migration is the only consumption-smoothing mechanism available to unskilled households.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…labor migration acts as a consumption-smoothing mechanism for the foreign unskilled households.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…it is assumed that the amount of remittances is determined one period in advance, and is based solely on a forecast of the immigrant wage in the home market and the resident wage in the foreign market, which is the only information available to support workers' decision.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…it is assumed that remittances represent an altruistic compensation mechanism between foreign workers residing in the home market and the foreign market.
144~D6~V12~Variable~Investment~…investment is a composite of the home and foreign goods.
144~D3, D6~V26~Variable~Net Foreign Assets~…international asset markets are incomplete, as the representative household in each economy holds risk-free, country-specific bonds from both the home and foreign market.
144~V7~L2~Variable Value~Skilled~…international asset markets are incomplete, and the skille households from each country trade country-specific, risk-free bonds.
144~D1, D4, D5~F26~Findings~Sunk Cost and Income Level~…increasing the sunk emigration cost, with all shocks incorporated harms the home skilled and helps the home unskilled (-3.0% and 19.0%); if the unskilled were to compensate the skilled, they would obtain a net loss of 31.5%. In the foreign market, the change benefits the skilled and harms the unskilled (2.9% and -4.7%); however, the skilled cannot compensate the unskilled and be better off (-2.3%).
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…in this research paper, it is assumed that an increase in border enforcement (reflected by United States border patrol hours) leads to an increase in the sunk emigration cost.
144~D1, D3, D4~F24~Findings~Low Restrictions, Shocks and Welfare~…in the steady state, lower restrictions to unskilled migration generate welfare losses for the skilled and gains for the unskilled (-11.4% and 9.6%). On the net, the unskilled can fully compensate the skilled and still obtain a welfare gain (2.2%). In the presense of shocks, the welfare losses of the skilled, the gains of the unskilled, and the net gain of the unskilled after transfers are even larger (-12.1%, 10.8%, and 2.9%). While the unskilled labor constitutes the majority in the foreign market, the extra welfare gains obtained after taking the dynamic effect of shocks into account point to improved consumption smoothing when migration barriers are eased.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…in the model, the absence of labor mobility restrictions would imply that immigrant labor efficiently exploits the ups and downs of the business cycle. That is, migrant labor would arrive in large numbers during economic expansions when it is most needed, and promptly return to the country of origin when a bad shock hits the destination economy. Higher border enforcement breaks this logic, because the increase in the stock of immigrant labor fails to keep pace with labor demand during expansions. Instead, immigrant labor becomes relative scarce, receives relatively higher wages, and sends larger remittances to the foreign economy.
144~D4, D5, D6~F16~Findings~Volatility of Total Consumption Growth~…in the estimated baseline model (in which only the skilled trade bonds internationally), the relative volatility of total consumption growth with respect to output is 1.60, slightly higher than the observed value for the sample period (1.23). This result is in line with other empirical findings in Aguiar and Gopinath that consumption in emerging market economies is about 45% more volatile than output.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…in the country of origin, lowering the migration barriers enhances labor income and facilitates consumption smoothing for the unskilled households. However, the measure also reduces the availability of unskilled labor in production, which is a complement for skilled labor and capital. Nonetheless, the net benefit after compensating the skilled is also positive, indicating a global Pareto improvement.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…in the baseline model, only the skilled households in each economy are financially integrated through international trade in bonds, while the unskilled are in financial autarky. This assumption is consistent with the empirical evidence, and allows researchers to examine the role of labor migration and remittances as a substitute for cross-border financial flows in consumption smoothing.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…in the alternative model, the one period, risk-free bond constitutes an additional instrument (other than migration and remittances) that foreign unskilled households use to smooth their inter-temporal consumption path and diversify away from county-specific risk. That is, foreign unskilled households have the option to lend abroad as an alternative to investing in emigration.
144~D3, D6~V10~Variable~Risk-Free Bond~…in the alternative model, the one period, risk-free bond constitutes an additional instrument (other than migration and remittances) that foreign unskilled households use to smooth their inter-temporal consumption path and diversify away from county-specific risk. That is, foreign unskilled households have the option to lend abroad as an alternative to investing in emigration.
144~D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…in order to compute the U.S. unskilled-Mexico maquiladora wage ratio, researchers conver the maquiladora wage in U.S. dollars using the nominal exchange rate.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…in equilibrium, the sunk emigration cost equals the benefit from emigration, with the latter given by the expected stream of future wage gains adjusted for the stochastic discount factor and the probaiblity of return to the country of origin every period.
144~D4, D6~V8~Variable~Consumption~…in a steady state, foreign household members residing in either the home market or the foreign market enjoy the same amount of consumption per unit of labor.
144~D1~F21~Findings~Apprehensions and Border Enforcement~…in 1989, apprehensions declined sharply without an apparent economic reason, reflecting a large increase in border enforcement that acted as a migration deterrent. In particular, the model succeeds in accounting for the sharp increase in apprehensions after the tequila crisis episode in 1996. Finally, the model captures the sharp increase in border apprehensions that began in early 2002, the result of both a relaxation in border enforcement and the recession in Mexico.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…immigrant workers send remittances to developing countries on a regular basis. Conservative estimates put the amount of workers' remittances to the developing world at $336 billion in 2008. These inflows were equivalent to more than 10% of the GDP of several receiving countries, while globally they were equivalent to 48% of the total private net capital flows to developing economies (including FDI, portfolio equity and private debt).
144~D1, D3, D6~F20~Findings~Immigrant Labor Entry Under Integration and Autarky~…immigrant labor entry under financial integration catches up with immigrant entry under financial autarky 6 quarters after an initial 1% shock in home productivity.
144~V6~L3~Variable Value~Immigrant Consumption~…immigrant consumption depends on the optimization problem of the foreign household and on the mechanism of remittances.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Substitution Between Capital and Unskilled Labor~…for this variable, researchers choose the prior mean values that together allow the model in steady state to match four stylized facts from the data.
144~D3, D4, D6~DV27~Derived Variable~Relative Productivity~…for this variable, researchers choose the prior mean values that together allow the model in steady state to match four stylized facts from the data.

144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Sunk Cost~…for this variable, researchers choose the prior mean values that together allow the model in steady state to match four stylized facts from the data.
144~D3~DV34~Derived Variable~Foreign Unskilled Budget Constraint~…for the unskilled household, it is useful to re-write the budget constraint to include the difference between the immigrant wage in the home market and the unskilled wage in the foreign market expressed in units of the foreign consumption basket.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…for the shares of unskilled in output, the elasticity of substitution between capital and unskilled workers, the relative productivity of skilled workers, and the sunk emigration costs, researchers choose the prior mean values that together allow the model in steady state to match four stylized facts from the data: the share of Mexico's labor force residing in the United States is 10% according to Hanson (2006), remittances represent the equivalent of 2.4% of Mexico's GDP according to the World Bank, the United States skill premium (given the skill definition) is 2.2, according to U.S. Census data, and the MExican skill premium is 2.5, according to data from Hanson (2006).
144~D1~V5~Variable~Border Patrol hours~…for the same number of attempted illegal crossings, an increase in border patrol hours may also resul in more arrests
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…for robustness, the estimation results obtained for the benchmark model are reported with financial autarky using linearly detrended data.
144~D1, D3, D4~T2~Time Period~1995-2006~…for remittances (in real pesos) the sample period is 1995:Q2 to 2006:Q3.
144~D6~V11~Variable~Capital~…for each type of household, capital accumulation follows a computational rule where the error term is an investment-specific technology shock, and the depreciation rate.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…for each household, immigrant workers residing in the home market send remittances to the foreign market every period.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~T1~Time Period~1980-2004~…for apprehensions, enforcement and the trade balance, the sample period is 1980:Q2 to 2004:Q3.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…for any immigrant worker, the steady-state amount of remittances is equal to the difference between the immigrant wage and immigrant consumption.
144~D1, D3, D6~F19~Findings~Bond Trading and New Immigrant Labor Arrival~…following a transitory, 1% increase in home productivity, bond trading generates a more muted increase in the arrival of new immigrant labor relative to the case with financial autarky.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…financial integration is introduced in a version of the baseline model of immigration.
144~D4, D6~V8~Variable~Consumption~…factor by which representative households maximize lifetime utility.
144~D3, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Labor Supply~…factor by which representative households maximize lifetime utility.
144~D3, D4, D5, D6~F15~Findings~Lagged Skill Premium Response~…estimates suggest a lagged response of the United States skill premium to unskilled migration from Mexico to the United States (the correlation of the skill premium with migration lagged by one year is 0.26). The model is successful in replicating this pattern as well (the correlation of the skill premium with migration flows lagged by one year is 0.86), due to the modelling of unskilled labor migration as a flow that gradually adds to the stock of established immigrants, as well as the time-to-buildassumption for the stock of immigrant labor (i.e. new immigrants start producing one period after arrival).
144~D4, D5, D6~DV23~Derived Variable~Home Intermediate Good Use~…equal to the domestic use of the home good and the exports to foreign markets.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…each unskilled household supplies a specific number of units of labor every period. Some unskilled household members reside and work abroad, whereas the rest work in the country of origin.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…each unskilled household sends an amount of new emigrant labor to the home market every period, where the stock of immigrant labor is built gradually over time.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…each unskilled household sends an amount of new emigrant labor to the home market every period, where the stock of immigrant labor is built gradually over time.

144~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility~…each of the two representative households maximizes lifetime utility as a function of consumption and labor supply.
144~D1~V1~Variable~Labor Migration~…due to the cross-country wage asymmetry, there is no labor migration from the home market to the foreign market.

144~D2, D3, D5~F8~Findings~Migration Flows and Total Remittances~…correlations of migration flows and total remittances with the Home-Foreign GDP ratio are poistive and significant, while labor migration flows are negatively correlated with the foreign GDP, whereas their correlation with the home GDP is not significantly different from zero. These findings are consistent with the data, and may be indicative of the inability of migrant labor to react to shocks in the destination economy due to migration costs.
144~D4, D6~V8~Variable~Consumption~…consumption is a composite of the home and foreign goods.
144~D1, D3, D4~T2~Time Period~1995-2006~…constricted time period from which remittance data is available, from 1995:Q1 to 2006:Q3.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…consistent with the business cycle features from emerging market economies, the baseline model generates consumption that is more volatile than output since migration is costly and the unskilled do not trade bonds.
144~D1, D4, D5~V3~Variable ~Sunk Cost~…changes in labor migration policies (i.e. border enforcement) are refected by shocks to the level of the sunk emigration costs.
144~D3, D4, D6~DV27~Derived Variable~Relative Productivity~…captures the relative productivity of the skilled compared with unskilled labor.
144~D3, D4~V23~Variable~Wage of Unskilled Labor~…calibration ensures that the unskilled wage is higher abroad than in the country of origin, so that the incentive to emigrate from Foreign to Home exists in every period.
144~D4~V26~Variable~Immigrant Labor Income~…because for each household immigrant workers residing in the home market send remittances to the foreign market every period, the immigrant labor income is divded entirely between remittances sent to the foreign market and immigrant consumption taking place in the home market.
144~D1~V5~Variable~Border Patrol hours~…because border enforcement affects the number of both crossings and arrests, and because the actual number of attempted crossings is unknown, one cannot disentangle the effect of enforcement from that of crossings on total apprehensions.
144~D3, D6~DV30~Derived Variable~Resource Constraint~…at the aggregate level, the resource constraint takes into account not only the consumption and investment of the native population, but also the consumption of immigrant workers established in home consumption.
144~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Log, First Difference~…as with the vector of observables, the cubic-detrended data and the model predictions are expressed in growth rates. One exception is the trade balance, which is normalized by GDP and expressed in first differences.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV43~Derived Variable~Steady State Welfare Effects~…as a standard, the welfare cost (or gain) relative to the benchmark estimated model is measured as the fraction of the expected aggregate consumption stream that one should add (or extract) so that households are indifferent between the benchmark estimated model and each of the two counterfactual scenarios.
144~D2, D3, D6~F7~Findings~Apprehensions, Remittances, and the Business Cycle~…apprehensions and remittances are procyclical with the U.S.-Mexico GDP ratio and countercyclical with Mexico's GDP; they are procyclical with the U.S. GDP, although the correlation is small, especially for apprehensions. The correlations for border patrol hours are close to zero, indicating that border enforcement is largely a political decision unaffected by economic considerations. Finally, the trade balance is countercyclical with Mexico's GDP.
144~D1~V5~Variable~Border Patrol hours~…an increase in border patrol hours is interpreted as an increase in border enforcement.
144~D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…a relative wage forecast above the stead-state ratio signals relative economic hardship for household members residing in the foreign market, and triggers a foreign individual in the home market to remit the extra funds.
144~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Remittance Flows~…a relative improvement in the purchasing power of the immigrant wage in terms of the consumption basket in the home market (where immigrant consumption takes place) or a relative deterioration of the purchasing power of the foreign wage in terms of the foreign consumption basket trigger an altruistic increase in remittances. The magnitude of the improvement characterize the thrust of the altruistic motive.
144~D3, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Demand Shock~…a preference shock that affects intertemporal substitution.
144~D6~V27~Variable~Technology Shock~…a neutral technology shock as included in both the foreign production and home production estimation models.
144~D4, D5, D6~DV24~Derived Variable~Capital and Native Labor~…a function of capital and skilled native labor as used in determining the home production function.
144~D1, D3, D6~DV23~Derived Variable~Perfect Substitutions~…a function in which native and immigrant unskilled labor enter as perfect substitutes as used in determining the home production function.
144~V7~L1~Variable Value~Unskilled~…a fraction of the foreign unskilled labor always remains in the foreign market.
144~D3, D6~V7~Variable~Labor Type~…a binary variable specifying for skilled and unskilled labor.
144~D1, D3, D6~DV38~Derived Variable~Total Flow of New labor~
144~D1, D4, D6~DV39~Derived Variable~Total Stock of immigrant Labor~

145~D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~…in light of the difficulty of finding random variation in technology adoption, this paper exploits shocks to the supply of skills to evaluate technology-skill complementarity. Specifically, it compares technology adoption rates across U.S. metropolitan areas with different shocks to the relative supply of high school dropouts induced by the recent wave of low-skilled immigration to the U.S.
145~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Technology Adoption Rates~…in light of the difficulty of finding random variation in technology adoption, this paper exploits shocks to the supply of skills to evaluate technology-skill complementarity. Specifically, it compares technology adoption rates across U.S. metropolitan areas with different shocks to the relative supply of high school dropouts induced by the recent wave of low-skilled immigration to the U.S.
145~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Technology Adoption Rates~…the fact that immigrants have persistently clustered into certain U.S. labor markets, so much so that one can predict recent skill mix changes in a market from long lags of immigrant density, it used in this paper to assess how technology adoption responds to increases in the relative supply of low-skill labor.
145~D1~V1~Variable~Technologies~…the technologies studied in the present paper are not computer, but this types of automation machinery introduced into manufacturing in the past few decades and covered by the 1988 and 1993 Surveys of Manufacturing Technology (SMT) used in this study.

145~D1~T1~Time Period~1983, 1993~…survey years from which Survey of Manufacturing Technology (SMT) data is drawn for the purposes of this study.
145~D1~V1~Variable~Technologies~…manufacturing automation is particulary suited to this study because the high school dropouts in SMT-covered industries, especially immigrants, are concentrated in labor-intensive assembly, welding, and other tasks that these technologies replace.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…this data covers SIC industries 34 through 38, which covers equipment and fabricated metal products.
145~D1, D4~V2~Variable~Industry~…this data covers SIC industries 34 through 38, which covers equipment and fabricated metal products. These industries are concentrated in labor-intensive assembly, welding, and other tasks that these technologies replace.
145~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the SMT technology data is combined with metropolitan area-level labor force data aggregated from the Current Population Surveys.
145~D3~D3~Dataset~Censuses of Population~…the SMT technology data is combined with metropolitan area-level labor force data aggregated from the Censuses of Population.
145~D4~D4~Dataset~Census of Manufactures~…the author uses a broader sample of manufacturing plants from the Census of Manufactures in the analysis portion of this research.
145~D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Ratio of High School Dropouts to Graduates~"…this is the ratio of high school dropouts to high school ""equivalents""."
145~D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~High School Equivalents~…exactly 12 years of schooling plus half of those with 13 to 15 years of schooling.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) specifications provide a flexible way to model production in general, and have become a common way to model capital-skill complementarity. Even limiting oneself to nested CES production functions there are a variety of ways to model capital-skill complementarity.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) specifications provide a flexible way to model production in general, and have become a common way to model capital-skill complementarity. Even limiting oneself to nested CES production functions there are a variety of ways to model capital-skill complementarity.
145~D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Manufacturing Final Output~…at the most abstract level, manufacturing final output combines intermediate non-production and production outputs.
145~D1, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Substitution~…y<=1 governs the elasticity of substitution between non-production (N) and production (P) outputs.
145~D1, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Production Output~…production output is a function of the employment of automation machinery and two types of production labor, high-skill and low-skill or, to link it explicity to the empirics, high-school graduates (H) and high school dropouts (L).
145~D2, D3~V3~Variable~Production Labor Types~…production output is a function of the employment of automation machinery and two types of production labor, high-skill and low-skill.
145~V3~L1~Variable Value~High-Skill~…high-skill is used to represent those workers with a high-school degree.
145~V3~L2~Variable Value~Low-Skill~…low-skill is used to represent those workers without a high-school degree.
145~D1, D2, D3~V4~Variable~Labor Inputs~…labor inputs are supplied inelastically.
145~D1, D2, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Degree of Substitutability~…[theta] defines the degree of substitutability between machines and unskilled labor.
145~D1, D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Low-Skill Production Share~…[alpha] defines the low-skill aggregate's share in production.
145~D1, D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Degree of Substitutability~…consistent with capital-skill complementarity, [theta] > [alpha].
145~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Low-Skill Production Share~…consistent with capital-skill complementarity, [theta] > [alpha].
145~D1, D4~V5~Variable~Non-Production Output~…non-production is modelled by N = C where C is the employment of college-educated workers. This modelled equation is oversimplified: a more general and realistic model would nest C with office equipment including the personal computer. While important, these other forms of capital are not the focus of the current study, so the author abstracts away from them to simplify the math.
145~V3~L3~Variable Value~College Graduates~…a third type of labor, college-educated workers.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~V6~Variable~Labor Markets~…rather than look across industries (or countries), the present study looks across local labor markets in the U.S., arguing that historical patterns of immigration generate exogenous changes in local skill mix.
145~D1, D4~V7~Variable~r~…the price of employment of automation machinery.
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…the employment of automation machinery, represented by K(M).
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…if K(M) is supplied perfectly elastically at price r, and if [theta] > [alpha] (a sufficient condition), then in equilibrium K(M) responds positively to exogenous increases in the relative supply of H and C-type labor where rK(M)/[alpha]P is K(M)'s share of the K(M)-L nest in (1) and s is production's share of final output. This expression was derived from setting the log differential of the first order condition for K(M) to zero under the elastic supply assumption, i.e. demand for capital has no effect on its price, r.
145~D1, D4~V8~Variable~Industry~…in the industries under study in this paper, as of 1993 (the last year of this study's data) only 17% of manufacturing equipment stock was in office equipment. More recent numbers are not much higher -- around 20%. In contrast, in the economy as a whole office equipment represents about 31% of equipment capital.
145~D1, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Production's Share of Final Output~…the variable s is production's share of final output.
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…the first order condition (previous note) can be rewritten to show capital is a fixed share of output.
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…the present paper's model implies that if [theta] > [alpha], capital's share of output rises with the relative supply of high-school production workers; similarly, if [theta] > y it also responds positively to the relative supply of college workers.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the regressions in this research largely ask how various proxies for K(M) respond to local skill mix shocks. The equations used to compute capital's share of output remind us that in order to be able to interpret any such relationship as coming from capital-skill complementarity, one must also show that output responds by a smaller amount to the same shocks.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…the regressions in this research largely ask how various proxies for K(M) respond to local skill mix shocks. The equations used to compute capital's share of output remind us that in order to be able to interpret any such relationship as coming from capital-skill complementarity, one must also show that output responds by a smaller amount to the same shocks.
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…the regressions in this research largely ask how various proxies for K(M) respond to local skill mix shocks. The equations used to compute capital's share of output remind us that in order to be able to interpret any such relationship as coming from capital-skill complementarity, one must also show that output responds by a smaller amount to the same shocks.
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…interestingly, if y is positive (again, a sufficient condition), capital responds more to the relative supply of high school than college workers: the coefficient on dln(H/L) in the current model's equation to compute capital's share of output is larger than the one on dln(C/H). The coefficient on dln(C/H) can even be negative under reasonable parameter values.
145~D1, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital's Share of Output~…most manufacturing capital is used in production and employed by workers with less than a college degree. In addition, the model (and the data used, largely) exclude the office computers that college workers use. Including office equipment in the nest with C would likely reverse this implication. An increase in the relative supply of C can push down production's share of output. This leads to a reduction of K(M) per output when y > [theta](1-w)/(1-[alpha]w).
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the current model also generally implies downward sloping relative demand for labor inputs.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…the current model also generally implies downward sloping relative demand for labor inputs.
145~D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Wages~…the expressions for relative wages in terms of labor mixes imply that the higher the substutability between low-skill labor and automation, the less sensitive relative wages will be to local changes skill mix. For example, in the case that [theta] = 1, wages are insensitve to changes in H/L. In essense, the fixed price (elastic supply) of capital buffers the impact of skill mix on the relative wages of factors that capital relatively substitutes for; in the extreme case that [theta] = 1, it pins down relative wages. In contrast, if capital supply were inelastic, wages would respond as if capital were skill neutral.
145~D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Wages~…y>0 and [theta]>[alpha] are jointly sufficient for relative wages to respond less to relative supply under elastic capital supply.
145~D1, D4~V9~Variable~Skill Requirement~"…in a simple version of technological revolutions, as produced by Beaudry and Green (2003, 2005), a new so-called ""modern"" production technique has a discretely higher skill requirement than an older ""traditional"" technique. The higher-skill requirement implies that use of the modern technique rises with the availability of skilled labor. This idea is an analog of what trade theorists call the ""Rybczynski theorem"". "
145~D1, D4~DV15~Derived Variable~Unit Isoquants~…unit isoquants of modern and traditional methods are shown in factor (H,L) space, along with the isocost line 1/W(H)r to 1/W(L)r.
145~DV15~L4~Variable Value~Modern Isoquants~...Q(M)=1 represents the unit isoquants of modern methods.
145~DV15~L5~Variable Value~Traditional Isoquants~…Q(T)=1 represents the unit isoquants of traditional methods.
145~D1, D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Isocost Line~…unit isoquants of modern and traditional methods are shown in factor (H,L) space, along with the isocost line 1/W(H)r to 1/W(L)r.
145~D1, D4~F1~Findings~Modern vs. Traditional Isoquant~…the modern isoquant is up and to the left of the traditional one, indicating its greater skill-intensity.
145~D1, D4~DV15~Derived Variable~Unit Isoquants~"…full employment inside the so-called ""cone of diversification"" (inside the two expansion paths coming from the origin) is reached by producing with a combination of modern and traditional methods, as indicated by the vectors leading to the endowment point (H, L)."
145~D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~…an increase in the relative supply of less-skilled labor - moving from (H,L) to (H,L') - results in greater use of the traditional method of production. In short, this very different model of technological change also implies that increases in relative supply of skilled labor increases the use of the new technology.
145~D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~"…in the standard interpretation of an illustrative model, the modern isoquants and the traditional isoquants represent different products. A local market faces elastic world demand for the two products, so changes in its factor mix are abosrbed by shift in product mix. What may appear to be a shift toward greater automation as the supply of skilled labor increases, therefore, might really be a shift to a more automation-intensive product mix (say, from ""low tech"" metal fittings to ""high tech"" machine tools). In the empirical analysis, therefore, it will be important to control for industry."

145~D1, D4~V8~Variable~Industry~"…what may appear to be a shift toward greater automation as the supply of skilled labor increases, therefore, might really be a shift to a more automation-intensive product mix (say, from ""low tech"" metal fittings to ""high tech"" machine tools).

145~D1, D4~V8~Variable~Industry~…the present study controls for industry in fine detail through four-digit SIC codes.
145~D1, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Four-Digit Industry, Price~…in some model specifications, four-digit industry will be interacted with product price, which captures differences in factor content of products within four-digit industries.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in some model specifications, four-digit industry will be interacted with product price, which captures differences in factor content of products within four-digit industries.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…in some model specifications, four-digit industry will be interacted with product price, which captures differences in factor content of products within four-digit industries.
145~D2, D3~V10~Variable~Wages~…the models of interest predict that as long as mix does not become too extreme (stays inside the cone of diversification), wages are not, in the long run, affected by local skill ratios. In the model of capital-skill complementarity this factor price insensity result holds only under extreme parameter values ([theta] = 1). Thus, the response of wages can help rule out that the results are driven by open economy adjustments or a model like BG.

145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…though the SMT was a random sample, it was also a small sample, so some areas could be over- or underrepresented by chance.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~"…a report prepared for the Census Bureau that compared employment and plant counts in the SMT sample to the Census of Manufactures showed that the data were close to geographically representative, with some minor exceptions, such as there being ""too few"" California plants in the 1988 SMT data."
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~~"…the analysis uses sample weights constructed to reflect the geographic distribution of employment in the SMT universe for the purpose of interpreting the results as the impact on technology use ""at the average worker's plant""."
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…the author assumes, as the Census Bureau did throughout most of the reports they published on the results of the SMT that non-response to any technology use question indicates that the plant is not using that technology.

145~D1, D2, D3, D4~F2~Findings~Average Employee's Plant-Level Technology Use~…in 1988, the average employee in the SMT-universe across the 143 metropolitan areas of interest was at a plant using six technologies. There is wide variation across plants in the use of technology; the standard deviation is nearly as large as the mean. More than 10% of this variation is accounted for by variation across labor markets, even when holding constant industry mix. When city dummies are added to a plant-level technology using regression, the R-squared increases by more than 0.1.

Another restriction is that there be at least one plant in both the 1993 and 1988 SMT surveys, which eliminates an additional 15 metropolitan areas.
145~D2, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~High School Dropouts Per High School Equivalent~…the focus of this study is on the effect of changes in L/H - high school dropouts per high school equivalent. Examining this skill margin has several motivations. First, it is the margin on which immigration to U.S. labor markets has its strongest influence, and a goal of this paper is to understand how immigrants are absorbed into U.S. labor markets. Second, it appears to be a skill margin relevant to the use of production-related automation technologies. Third, differences in the occupational mix of workers by education argue for a focus on the high school education margin.
145~D3~DV21~Derived Variable~Proportion of Hours by Occupation~…shows the proportion of worker's hours in SMT-covered industries that were in selected occupations in 1990 by the education level and nativity of the worker.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…the data usefully identify an ocupation which directly involves modern manufacturing machinery: programmers and operators of computers and numerically controlled (CNC) machines.
145~D3~D3~Dataset~Censuses of Population~…the proportion of hours worked by occupation within an SMT-covered industry is computed using the 1990 census of population. The sample used to compute the table was limited to workers residing in the geographic region covered by the regression analysis.
145~D3~D3~Dataset~Censuses of Population~…in the 1990 census, programmers and operators of computers and numerically controlled (CNC) machines are identified separately in occupation codes 233 and 714.
145~D1, D3~V21~Variable~Occupation~…the occupation of an individual respondent used in order to differentiate technology and skill trends within occupations.
145~V21~L11~Variable Value~CNC Operators~…operators of computers and numerically controlled (CNC) machines.
145~V21~L11~Variable Value~CNC Operators~…CNC operators are overrepresented among high school graduates and those with some college relative to those with both more and less education.
145~D1, D3~F4~Findings~Top Ten Dropout Occupation Concentration Across Skill and Nativity Groups~…45% of native-born and 56% percent of foreign-born dropout (and only 23% of some college and 5% of college-graduate) worker's hours are concentrated in the top ten dropout occupations. 
145~V3~L3~Variable Value~College Graduates~"…the top ten occupations of four-year college graduates, comprising 60% of the hours they work in SMT industries, are all non-production jobs. This fact motivated putting them in a separate production ""nest"" from less-educated workers in the model."
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…estimates cross section and first difference relationships between the number of technologies in use (or added) and a general specification of education mix: the metropolitan area's share of workers with high school, some college and at least four years of college.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…estimates cross section and first difference relationships between the number of technologies in use (or added) and a general specification of education mix: the metropolitan area's share of workers with high school, some college and at least four years of college.
145~D1, D2, D3~F5~Findings~High School Education and Automated Manufacturing Plants~…areas with a larger proportion of workers with high school education or more have significantly more automated manufacturing plants. The magnitude of this association is largest for areas with a high relative supply of workers with a high school degree or some college education. The coefficient of (four-year) college share is smaller than the two, though is not statistically different. this implies the effect of the supply of four-year college graduates relative to high school graduates is small or even negative.
145~D2, D3~F5~Findings~Foreign Born vs. Native Dropout Working Hour Concentration~…9% of foreign-born dropouts' working hours were in SMT-covered industries in 1990, which compares to 10% for native-born. The fact that immigrants are well represented in these industries suggests it is feasible that immigration affected skill ratios in these industries.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the analysis will take advantage of differences in the change in skill mix across metropolitan areas that can be predicted by historical patterns of immigration.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…the analysis will take advantage of differences in the change in skill mix across metropolitan areas that can be predicted by historical patterns of immigration.
145~D1, D4~DV18~Derived Variable~Technologies Added~…in order to identify an effect on machine use, the author needs to observe any changes in machine use before either worker mobility or open economy adjustments -- shifts in product mix -- re-equate wages with other markets.
145~D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~…in order to identify an effect on machine use, the author needs to observe random shocks to skill supply where wages and machinery use adjust freely.
145~D1~V1~Variable~Technologies~…the assumption that machinery's supply is elastic, or its price is fixed, is a maintained assumption which seems plausible when, as here, metro areas are the unit of analysis, as each is small part of the national demand for capital
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~V12~Variable~Metropolitan Area~…each metropolitan area is a small part of the national demand for capital.
145~D1, D4~V13~Variable~Product Mix~…shifts in product mix are at least partially observable and accounted for by controlling for industry mix.
145~D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Wages~…forces which raise less-skilled relative wages - such as demand shock in sectors outside manufacturing - would both attract low skill workers and encourage labor-replacing technology adoption.
145~D2, D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Skill Mix, Immigrant Arrivals~…to address the idea that forces which raise less-skilled relative wages would both attract low skill workers and encourage labor-replacing technology adoption, researchers construct an instrument for changes in dropouts per high school equivalent using the impact that persistent, geographically concentrated flows of immigrants have had on the skill mix of U.S. cities. If this variation represents labor supply shifts, it allows identification of the combination of parameters of interest.
145~D2, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~High School Dropouts Per High School Equivalent~…let (L/H)c represent dropouts per high school equivalent in city c.
145~D3~V14~Variable~Immigrant Arrivals~…immigrant arrivals are denoted by the I superscript.
145~D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~…the model claims that to raise a city's less-skilled relative supply, immigration must both make up a substantial fraction of the city's workforce and be more unskilled than the city's existing workforce.
145~D2, D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Skill Mix, Immigrant Arrivals~"…this instrument takes advanatge of the strong tendency of new immigrants to settle into existing ""enclaves"" of immigrants from the same part of the world The argument for this type of instrument's validity is that the persistence of regional immigration patterns derives from new immigrants' preference to resettle with family - and much of U.S. immigration is ""family-based"" - or to be in a culturally familiar environment."
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~V11~Variable~Metropolitan Area~…in this paper, where immigrants settled in 1970 is used to predict where they will settle in the 1980s and 1990s.
145~D3~V15~Variable~Country-of-Origin~…let g=1…G index country-of-origin groups partitioning all immigrants.
145~D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Number of High School Immigrants~"…H^(Ig) is the number of high school immigrants from country g and who settled anywhere in the U.S. during the relevant analysis period (computed using the ""year of arrival"" question in the 1990 and 2000 censuses of population)."
145~D3~DV24~Derived Variable~Number of Dropout Immigrants~"…L^(Ig) is the number of dropout immigrants from country g and who settled anywhere in the U.S. during the relevant analysis period (computed using the ""year of arrival"" question in the 1990 and 2000 censuses of population)."
145~D3~V16~Variable~Year of Arrival~"…the ""year of arrival"" question in the 1990 and 2000 censuses of population is used to determine whether an immigrant settled in the U.S. during the relevant analysis period."
145~D3~DV25~Derived Variable~Predicted Immigration by City~"…high school and dropout immigrants are apportioned to metro areas according to the 1970 settlement patterns, to ""predict"" recent immigration by city."
145~D3~DV26~Derived Variable~Share of Immigrant Stock~…public-use 1970 census data are used to estimate the share of the immigrant stock from country g living in metropolitan area c in 1970 regardless of skill level. This captures the idea of the immigrant enclaves.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~"…in the first stage regressions, if immigrants settled in the same cities in the same proportions as they did in 1970, and if other changes in workforce composition were unrelated to the instrument -- if there is little offsetting ""native flight"" -- then the first stage coefficient is one. The coefficient could also be larger than one if native- and foreign-born inter-city migration favors the same cities."
145~D1, D2, D3~F6~Findings~First Stage Coefficients and Immigration Flows~…for 1980-88, the first stage coefficient is larger than one, reflecting that, due to data limitations, immigration flows are measured 1980-86 instead of 1980-88. For 1988-93 the coefficient is indistinguishable from one, consistent with identifying labor shocks that have not dissipated by intercity mobility.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to be consistent with specifications estimated for 1980 to 88, and to rule out the first stage derives from cross-sectional skill mix differences, the first two specifications include a control for dropouts per high school equivalent in 1980.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…to be consistent with specifications estimated for 1980 to 88, and to rule out the first stage derives from cross-sectional skill mix differences, the first two specifications include a control for dropouts per high school equivalent in 1980.
145~D3~V16~Variable~Year of Arrival~…the year of arrival question is reported in categories in the 1990 Census.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…estimates of the relationship between the number of technologies added and the change in dropouts per high school equivalent between 1988 and 1993 are performed with both ordinary least squares and instrumental variable regression analysis.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…estimates of the relationship between the number of technologies added and the change in dropouts per high school equivalent between 1988 and 1993 are performed with both ordinary least squares and instrumental variable regression analysis.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…the first instrumental variable specification estimates have no additional controls. The next specification adds controls for detailed industry, dividing SMT plants into 161 four-digit industries.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the first OLS specification estimates have no additional controls. The next specification adds controls for detailed industry, dividing SMT plants into 161 four-digit industries.
145~D1, D4~DV27~Derived Variable~Four-Digit Industry~…detailed industry controls are created by dividing SMT plants into 161 four-digit industries.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…standard errors are computed to be robust to arbitrary error correlation among plants in the same metropolitan area.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…standard errors are computed to be robust to arbitrary error correlation among plants in the same metropolitan area.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…as a test of the validity of this estimation procedure, the dependent variable is replaced with one from the 1988 survey, which asked plants how many technologies they planned to add over the next five years. It could cast serious doubt on a causal interpretation of these relationships if future changes in skill mix depressed plans to add technology. In fact, there is no such relationship as coefficient estimates are insignifiant, and even relatively small negative values are ruled out by these estimates.

In fact, there is no such relationship as coefficient estimates are insignifiant, and even relatively small negative values are ruled out by these estimates.
145~D1~V17~Variable~Five-Year Investment Plan~…asks plants how many technologies they planned to add over the next five years.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…the 1993 technology added question appears to capture changes in technology use over the 1988-93 period well. Unfortunately, there is no similar question in the 1988 survey. In order to analyze the period before this, the author takes advantage of the fact that the machines covered by the SMT were hardly used before the early 1980s, which means that the level of use is roughly equal to the change in technology since 1980.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV28~Derived Variable~Change Since 1980~…denotes the change in a variable since 1980.
145~D1~F7~Findings~Actual Level of Automation vs. Forecast~…in the admittedly non-random sample of plants available in both the 1988 and 1993 surveys, a regression on the actual number of technologies added on the forecast produces a coefficient of 0.21 (standard error 0.10). So plant managers have some ability to forecast, but it is not tremendous. On the other hand, if plant managers themselves do not make very accurate forecasts of future investments, it seems unlikely that foreign workers settle in markets in anticipation of them.
145~D1~F8~Findings~Number of Technologies and Automation~"…a regression of the changes in the numbers of technologies in use on the ""technologies added"" variable produces a coefficient of 0.65 (with a standard error, clustered on metropolitan area, of 0.07). Direct first difference estimates 1988-93 are negative but uninformative because of large standard error, though unweighted estimates are signficiant at the 10% level."
145~D1~V17~Variable~Five-Year Investment Plan~…it is fair to ask how accurately plant managers actually forecast their investment plans through a regression on the actual number of technologies added on the forecast.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…in the detailed-industry group analysis, to address the possibility that even four-digit industries may not fully absorb heterogeneity in the automation-intensity of the products, the third specification controls for four-digit industires interacted with the price of products sold by the plant.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in the detailed-industry group analysis, to address the possibility that even four-digit industries may not fully absorb heterogeneity in the automation-intensity of the products, the third specification controls for four-digit industires interacted with the price of products sold by the plant.
145~D1, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Four-Digit Industry, Price~…in the detailed-industry group analysis, to address the possibility that even four-digit industries may not fully absorb heterogeneity in the automation-intensity of the products, the third specification controls for four-digit industires interacted with the price of products sold by the plant.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Four-Digit Industry, Price and Local Skill Supply~…the interacted controls between four-digit industry and price are quite powerful, absorbing half of the variation in technology use across plants. Nevertheless, the influence of local skill supply is robust to within-industry product quality controls. So while it is still possible to argue product heterogeneity actually drives the relationship - i.e. that markets with low skill labor have a less technology-intensive product mix not fully captured by these controls - given how little impact these controls have on the estimates, this argument requires that these controls capture almost none of the variation the technology-intensity of products across markets, despite the fact that they capture a lot of variation in technology use across plants.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…the SMT contains a number of other plant characteristics which might be added as regression controls.
145~D1, D4~V19~Variable~Plant Size~…although larger plants use more technology, it is not entirely clear that a plant's size should be controlled for: a plant's size may be endogenous response to the technology choice.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…the fourth specification adds the natural log of a plant's employment (from the prior-year CM) as a control.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the fourth specification adds the natural log of a plant's employment (from the prior-year CM) as a control.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4~F10~Findings~Plant Employment, Dropout Share, and Technology Use~…with the natural log of a plant's employment (from the prior-year CM) added as a control, one continues to find a significant, albeit reduced in magnitude, relationship between dropout share and technology use.
145~D1, D4~V20~Variable~Product Price~…there are six product price categories. In addition, the author treats non-response as a separate category.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Manufacturing Technology~…the SMT is useful for measuring the use of specific types of machines which are likely to be highly substitutable for low-skill labor, but the sample is small. 
145~D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Book Value of Machinery Per Worker~…a less refined but continuous measure of capital intensity, the book value of machinery per worker, is available in a much larger survey than the SMT, the Census of Manufactures (CM).
145~D4~D4~Dataset~Census of Manufactures~…a less refined but continuous measure of capital intensity, the book value of machinery per worker, is available in a much larger survey than the SMT, the Census of Manufactures (CM).
145~D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Book Value of Machinery Per Worker~…if manufacturing machinery broadly complements mid-skilled labor and substitutes for less-skilled labor, exogenous increases in the relative supply of less-skilled labor should reduce capital per worker.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…shows estimates in which the dependent variable is the change in the natural log of the (book) value of machinery per employee, pooled from 1987 and 1992 CMs, which is first regression-adjusted to take out the effects of four-digit industry. The sample is all plants in the CM with at least 20 employee, which is the universe for the SMT and CM. For a handful of plants in each year the book vlaue of machinery is missing. The author imputed missing machinery values at these plants from industry-specific estimates of a log-linear relationship with total shipments (estimated using the sample of reporting plants and four-digit industry); if that was not available, the mean value of machinery per employee in the plant's metropolitan area was assigned to the plant. Dropping these plants has little effect on the results, most likely becuase there are so few of them. The imputation procedure was used only because the Census Bureau frowns upon small changes in sample between specifications run with restricted access microdata.

145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~2SLS~…to confirm that results derive from capital-skill complementarity, estimates are shown where the dependent variable is the natural log of output (value added) per worker.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to confirm that results derive from capital-skill complementarity, estimates are shown where the dependent variable is the natural log of output (value added) per worker.
145~D4~DV31~Derived Variable~Value Added Per Worker~…the natural log of output (value added) per worker.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4~F11~Findings~Dropouts Per High School Equivalent and Output~…in neither OLS nor IV is there a statistically significant relationship between dropouts per high school equivalent and output. In addition, the proportional response of machinery per worker and the SMT technologies is uniformly larger than the proportional response of ouptut. Dividing earlier coefficients by the mean number of technologies in use, the proportional response is between 1.0 and 2.0. This is much larger than the estimated proportional output response in Panel B, consistent with capital-skill complementarity.
145~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…estimates the relationship between changes in manufacturing wages and changes in dropouts per high school equivalent. The dependent variable is the adjusted ln wage gap between dropouts and high school completers. The natural log of the hourly wage of person (i) in metro area c is regressed on area dummies, area dummies interacted with a high school dropout dummy, and individual covariates. This regression includes only manufacturing workers with 9-12 years of education who are employed, have at least one year of potential experience (age - years of education - 6), are 20-65 years old, and earn wages between $2 and $200 in 1999 dollars.

To address the problem that the CPS is simply too small a wage sample to get reliable estimates of changes in average wages at the metropolitan levels and the fact that it is not possible to separte out native-born workers in the CPS, subsequen specifications use data from five percent public-use files of the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses of Population for the same 143 metro areas. Since those estimates include two decadal changes (1980-1990, 1990-2000), they also inclued a decade dummy as a control."

145~D2, D3~F13~Findings~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor and Wages~…the second wage specification estimated using the Census data shows a significant, negative relationship between the relative supply and wages. This specificiation includes foreign workers, and so may be biased down by compositional changes associated with immigration. However, when foreign-born workers are dropped, instrumental variables estimates are similar in magnitude.
145~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…in the 1987-1989 data, anyone who reports attending and completing twelve years of education, or who reports attending but not completing thirteen years of education, is counted as a high school completer. In the 1992-1994 data, only those who report highest grade completed as ""High school graduate, diploma or GED"" are counted as high school completers. Those with less education (including ""12th grade, no diploma"" down to completed nine years, or attended ten years, in 1987-89, or completed ninth grade, in 1992-94) are high school dropouts."
145~D3~D3~Dataset~Censuses of Population~"…in the 1980 census, dropouts and high school completers are defined as in the 1987-89 CPS. In the 1990 Census, they are defined the same as in the 1992-94 CPS. In the 2000 Census the definition is similar to 1990, though the education category ""High school graduate"" drops the reference to ""diploma or GED."""

145~D2, D3~F14~Findings~Relative Wage Gap Estimates Across Specifications~…the relative wage gap IV estimate has a positive coefficient on dropout relative supply and a negative one on college relative supply, and the magnitude of the own supply effect is larger for college graduates. The latter remains true when convereted to elasticities: at mean skill shares (in 1990, roughly .3 for dropouts/high school equivalent and .9 for college/high school equivalent), the inverse elasticity is .08 (=.3*.277) for dropouts/high school, and .55(=.9*.613) for college/high school. These estimates are imprecise as neither is distinguished from zero at the 10% level.
145~D1, D2, D3~F15~Findings~Less-Skilled Labor's Impact~…throughout the paper, IV estimate of less-skilled labor's impact tend to be larger in magnitude than OLS estimates. When wages are the outcome this seems sensible - wages partly reflect local differences in labor demand which likely influence where workers choose to live. This story is also consistent with IV estimates being larger than OLS estimates when technology use is the dependent variable. Third, factors that drive up low-skill relative wages may both attract low-skill workers and encourage low-skill replacing technology adoption, biasing OLS estimates of the impact of skill mix on technology adoption (and wages) towards zero. In addition measurement error in skill mix may attenuate OLS estimates, and general changes in skill mix may have a smaller impact than immigration-induced ones.

146~146: Immigration, Skill Mix, and the Choice of Technique~~~~
146~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…using detailed plant-level data from the 1988 and 1993 Surveys of Manufacturing Technology, this paper examines the impact of skill mix in U.S. local labor markets on the use and adoption of automation technologies in manufacturing.
146~D1~T1~Time Period~1988, 1993~…survey years from which plant-level data from the Surveys of Manufacturing Technology is drawn.
146~D1~V1~Variable~Automation~…the level of automation differs widely across U.S. metropolitan areas.
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…this paper evaluates the extent to which producers adapt technology to local input supplies using detailed from the 1988 and 1993 Surveys of Manufacturing Technology (SMTs) on the use of automation technologies introduced into manufacturing in the past few decades.
146~D1~V1~Variable~Automation~"…as with other recent technological advances, new plant automation techniques were projected to increase the relative employment of skilled workers, or as one study put it, ""…jobs eliminated are semi-skilled or unskilled, while jobs created require significant technical background."
146~D1~V1~Variable~Automation~…manufacturing automation is particularly suited to evaluating the impact of immigration because less-skilled workers in SMT-covered industries, especially immigrants, are concentrated in labor-intensive assembly, welding, and other tasks that these technologies replace.
146~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…technology data are supplemented with labor force data from Current Population Surveys.
146~D3~D3~Dataset~Censuses of Population~…technology data are supplemented with labor force data from Censuses of Population.
146~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Skill Supply Impact~…instrumental variables estimates, based on historical less-skilled immigrant patterns, show that, if anything, simple least squares correlations understate the impact of skill supply on the use of technology. A typical estimate is that a 10-percentage-point (one standard deviation) increase in the less skilled relative supply reduces the technology use at a typical worker's plant by roughly 0.5 technologies on a base of 6 technologies. So the impact of skill supply is substantial.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~"…a version of Beaudry and Green's model (who model the choice among available technologies in which firms choose between two technologies of high (""modern"") and low (""traditional"") skill-intensity. An immigration shock which raises the relative less-skilled labor induces less modern technology), modified to be appropriate for a local labor market, can be used to show how local labor markets might adapt to less-skilled immigration in a way that affects technology but not reative wages. The key change from their model is to make the supply of capital elastic. This change reduces thte model to essentially a two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin model, where the goods of different factor intensities have been relabeled as ""technologies"" of different factor intensities."
146~D1~V1~Variable~Automation~…T(jcn) represents the use of technology at plant n in industry j in city c.
146~D1~V10~Variable~Plant Age~…the SMT surveys records establishment characteristics, such as plant age.
146~V3~L1~Variable Value~Skilled Labor~…L(J) represents less-skilled labor.
146~V3~L2~Variable Value~Less-Skilled Labor~…H(J) represents skilled labor.
146~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Parameters~…a(J), B(J), and A(J) are parameters with 0<a(J), B(J)<1.
146~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Labor Market Clearing Condition~…factor demands are substituted into labor market clearing conditions, H = H(T) + H(M) and L = L(T) + L(M).
146~D1~L3~Variable Value~a(J)~…Beaudry and Green's assumptions can be represented as restrictions on this parameter. The only assumption critical for the current researcher's purpose, however, is that the modern technology is relatively skill-intensive.
146~D1~L4~Variable Value~B(J)~…Beaudry and Green's assumptions can be represented as restrictions on this parameter. The only assumption critical for the current researcher's purpose, however, is that the modern technology is relatively skill-intensive.
146~D1, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~D~…substituting factor demands into labor market clearing conditions, H = H(T) + H(M) and L = L(T) + L(M), produces a matrix whose elements are each positive.
146~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital Used in Technology~…an interesting and realistic case is one in which the modern method is relatively capital-intensive. Under this assumption, an increase in less-skilled relative labor supply also causes the capital intensity of production to fall, providing another testable implication of the model.
146~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Capital Used in Technology~…this model has the nice feature that it is consistent with the stylized fact that immigration has little impact on relative wages in local labor markets, and has an additional testable implication that immigration should reduce use of skill-complementary capital, and possibly reduces capital intensity generally.
146~D1~V10~Variable~Plant Age~…one of four plant-level controls included in the fifth 2SLS specification entered as a dummy variable for each category of response.
146~D1~V10~Variable~Plant Age~"…""How many years has this establishment manufactured products at this location?"" Available in both 1988 and 1993."
146~D1~V11~Variable~Ownership~…the SMT surveys records establishment characteristics, such as ownership.
146~D1, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Sample Weight~…to ensure that the present analysis would be geographically representative, the author constructed new sample weights to properly reflect the geographic distribution of plants in the SMT-universe. The author merged each plant in the SMT to the prior-year (1987 and 1992) Census of Manufactures. Then, new strata were constructed - two-digit SIC industry by class size by metropolitan area. The equivalent of the original SMT weights would be to construct, in each of the new strata, a weight equal to the number of plants in the Census of Manufactures universe divided by the number of plants in the SMT sample. However, for the purpose of studying the impact ofthe labor force, the author wanted weights that were representative employment, not plants. So instead, a weight equal to the strata employment in the Census of Manufactures divided by the number of plants in the SMT.
146~D1~V12~Variable~Production Type~…the SMT surveys records establishment characteristics, such as production type.
146~D1~V13~Variable~Military Contractor Status~…the SMT surveys records establishment characteristics, such as military contractor status.
146~D1~V13~Variable~Military Contractor Status~…the sixth 2SLS specification adds military contractor variables.
146~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~…examining this skill margin - the very low educated relative to those with high school and vocational training - has two motivations. First, it is the margin on which foreign-immigration to U.S. labor markets has the strongest influence and a major goal of this paper is to understand how immigrants are absorbed into U.S. labor markets. Second, it is a relevant skill margin to affect the use of the mostly production automation related technologies covered by the SMT.
146~D1~F2~Findings~Modern Isoquant Skill Intensity~…the modern isoquant is up and to the left of the traditional one, indicating its greater skill intensity.
146~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~…LS(c) represents the relative supply of less skilled labor in city-c.
146~D1~V13~Variable~Military Contractor Status~…military contractors generally use more technologies, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1989, 1994).
146~DV2~L5~Variable Value~Modern Output~…depend negatively on the relative supply of less-skilled labor so long as |D| > 0. This is equivalent to the condition a(T)(1 - a(M))B(M) > a(M)(1-a(T))B(T) which follows from the assumption that the modern technology is relatively skill-intensive.
146~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor~"…the primary measure of less-skilled relative labor supply used in this paper will be the high school dropouts per high school ""equivalent."""
146~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Plant Characteristics~…X(jcn) is a vector of plant characteristics.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Slope Coefficient~…the slope coefficient, [theta], measures the impact of less-skilled supply on the use of technology. If the theoretical model is correct, then [theta] will be negative in sign; under the null that technology is the same in all locations it is zero.
146~D1, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Product Price, Industry~…to capture the possibility that even though there is little international specialization across four-digit industries, countries with a low relative supply of capital or skilled labor may tend to specialize in lower quality products within four-digit industries, the author will include specifications that interact product price categories, indexed by p, with industry.
146~DV2~L6~Variable Value~Traditional Output~…Y(T) depends positively on the relative supply of less-skilled labor. Thus the relative use of the modern method falls with an increase in less-skilled relative labor supply, as they researchers wanted.
146~DV2~L5~Variable Value~Modern Capital~…the use of modern machinery, K(M), falls as less-skilled relative supply increases which is the implication tested below.
146~D1, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Product Price, Industry~…a(jp) represents a vector of industry x product price dummies.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the inessentiality of the Cobb-Douglass functional form is evident. The assumption (for constant any constant returns to scale technology) is sufficient to obtain these results. This is an assumption that Beaudry and Green (2000) make.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…an interesting and realistic case is one in which the modern method is relatively capital-intensive. Under this assumption, an increase in less-skilled relative labor supply also causes the capital intensity of production to fall, providing another testable implication of the model.
146~D1, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Product Price, Industry~…to further control for product quality within industry in the OLS regressions, the third specification interacts four-digit industry with the product-price categories.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~"…this model has the nice feature that it is consistent with the stylized fact that immigration has little impact on relative wages in local labor markets, and has an additional testable implication that immigration should reduce use of skill-complementary capital, and possibly reduces capital intensity generally. It has the drawback that by simply relabeling the modern traditional ""methods"" as modern and traditional "" goods (in a small, open economy) one obtais the same implications; that is, an apparent shift in the method of production might really be a shift in the mix of goods (say, from ""low tech"" metal fittings to ""high tech"" machine tools). However, one can distinguish the ""methods"" from the ""goods"" interpretation of the model by looking at how the technology used to produce the same goods varies with relative labor supply. For a given good, the ""methods"" interpretation says technology depends on relative labor supply, while the ""goods"" interpretation assumes technology is invariant to relative labor supply."
146~D1, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Product Price, Industry~"…seven categories of ""prices charged for most products"" (including ""no response"" category) fully interacted w/ four digit industries."
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…the technology data used in this project come from the 1988 and 1993 Surveys of Manufacturing Technology (SMT). Each polled a statified random sample of around 10,000 manufacturing establishments with at least 20 employees in SIC industries 34-38 on the use of, plans for use of, reasons for use of (or for not using) 17 categories of advanced manufacturing technologies.
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…the industries covered by the SMT - fabricated metal products, industrial machinery and equipement, electronic and other equipment, transportation equipment, instruments and related prodcuts - make up a large part of the manufacturing sector (43% of value added and employment in 1987, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1989)).
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~"…the SMT technologies include processes used both in production and non-production activities, but most of the technologies are for use on the shop floor. Many also appear to replace raw labor, such as automated inspection (alternatively handled by semiskileed ""production inspectors""), automated materials handling, and robots."
146~D1~V13~Variable~Military Contractor Status~"…""Are any of the products produced in this plant manufactured to military specifications?"" Available in 1988 and 1993."
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~"…the SMT surveys records establishment characteristics, such as plant size, plant age, ownership, production type, military contractor status. The responses were in categories. Rather than drop observations that did not respond to one of these plant characteristics questions, the author treated non-response as a separate category of ""response"" to each question."
146~D1~V14~Variable~Response~"…the SMT responses were in categories. Rather than drop observations that did not respond to one of the plant characteristics questions, the author treated nonresponse as a separate category of ""response"" to each question."
146~D1, D4~V15~Variable~Industry~"…the strata used to create each of the SMT samples consisted of three-digit SIC industry by ""class size"" cells."
146~D1, D4~V15~Variable~Industry~…a(j) represents a vector of industry dummies.
146~D1, D4~V15~Variable~Industry~…the most important control variables in cross-sectional regressions are the industry dummies, a(j). Industries vary in their use of technology and skill mix. Also, open-economy models predicts differences in worker mix across markets are absorbed by differences in industry mix. Including industry dummies is equivalent to asking how much local skill ratios shift the method by which the same industries produce. 
146~D1, D4~V15~Variable~Industry~…the second OLS specification controls for detailed industry, dividing SMT plants into 161 four-digit industries.
146~D1~V17~Variable~Sampling Rate~…within each SMT strata, a simple random sample was taken, and a weight was recorded equal to one over the sampling rate for that strata (the average sampling rate was about one-fourth.
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~"…the strata used to create each of the SMT samples consisted of three-digit SIC industry by ""class size"" cells. There were three class sizes, defined by employment. Within each strata, a simple random sample was taken, and a weight was recorded equal to one over the sampling rate for that strata. Though the SMT was in theory a random sample, it was also a small sample. To ensure that the present analysis would be geographically representative, the author constructed new sample weights to properly reflect the geographic distribution of plants in the SMT-universe. The author merged each plant in the SMT to the prior-year (1987 and 1992) Census of Manufactures. Then, new strata were constructed - two-digit SIC industry by class size by metropolitan area. The equivalent of the original SMT weights would be to construct, in each of the new strata, a weight equal to the number of plants in the Census of Manufactures universe divided by the number of plants in the SMT sample. However, for the purpose of studying the impact ofthe labor force, the author wanted weights that were representative employment, not plants. So instead, a weight equal to the strata employment in the Census of Manufactures divided by the number of plants in the SMT."
146~D4, D6~V18~Variable~Employment~…used in computing the paper-specific sample rate by dividing number of plants in the SMT from strata employment in the Census of Manufactures.
146~D4, D6~V18~Variable~Employment~…employment in total non-farm employment and comes from County Business Patterns county summary files.

146~V9~L11~Variable Value~100 to 499~…the middle of three class size indicators as specifying for a plant with 100 to 499 employees.
146~V9~L12~Variable Value~More than 500~…the largest of three class size indicators as specifying for a plant with more than 500 employees.
146~D1~V2~Variable~Technologies~"…in the simple illustrative model, perfectly competitive producers have available to them modern and traditional technologies which can each be represented by a Cobb-Douglass production function where J indexes the ""traditional"" (T) and ""modern"" (M) technologies; L(J) represents less-skilled labor, H(J) represents skilled labor, K(J) represents capital used in technology J; and a(J), B(J), and A(J) are parameters with 0 < a(J), B(J) < 1."
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~"…to address the concern that less-skilled workers might seek out ""low-tech"" markets where the relative demand for less-skilled labor is higher, generating a spurious correlation between technology use and local skill ratios, the researcher instruments for the relative supply of less-skilled labor in a particular city. The main instrument used can be described as the share of dropouts among ""predicted"" recent immigrants."
146~D4~D4~Dataset~Census of Manufactures~…the author merged each plant in the SMT to the prior-year (1987 and 1992) Census of Manufactures in constructing a new sample weight.
146~D4~D4~Dataset~Census of Manufactures~…an SMT sample weight was created equal to strata employment in the Census of Manufactures divided by the number of plants in the SMT.
146~D4~T2~Time Period~1987, 1992~…survey years from which Census of Manufactures data is drawn.

146~D1~V2~Variable~Technologies~…in a majority of the regressions used in the analysis portion of this research paper, the dependent variable will be a simple count of the number of the 17 technologies in use by the plant. 
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…the initial analysis will consist of cross-sectional regressions of technology use on the relative supply of less-skilled labor in the local work force. These regressions are of the form where the dependent variable T(jcn) represents the use of technology at plant n in industry j in city c and explanatory variables include a(j) which represents a vector of industry dummies, LS(c) which represents the relative suply of less-skilled labor in city-c, X(jcn) which represents a vector of plant characteristics, and a slope coefficient, [theta], measures the impact of less-skilled supply on the use of technology. If the theoretical model is correct, then [theta] will be negative in sign; under the null that technology is the same in all locations it is zero.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the initial analysis will consist of cross-sectional regressions of technology use on the relative supply of less-skilled labor in the local work force. These regressions are of the form where the dependent variable T(jcn) represents the use of technology at plant n in industry j in city c and explanatory variables include a(j) which represents a vector of industry dummies, LS(c) which represents the relative suply of less-skilled labor in city-c, X(jcn) which represents a vector of plant characteristics, and a slope coefficient, [theta], measures the impact of less-skilled supply on the use of technology. If the theoretical model is correct, then [theta] will be negative in sign; under the null that technology is the same in all locations it is zero.
146~D1~V2~Variable~Technologies~…the author assumes, as the Census Bureau did throughout most of the reports they published on the results of the SMT (1989, 1994), that non-response to any technology use question indicates that the plant is not using that technology.
146~D1~V2~Variable~Technologies~…controls for the number of technologies in use (entered as dummies).
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~"…this instrument takes advantage of the strong tendency of new immigrants from different parts of the world to settle into U.S. labor markets where immigrants from the same part of the world are already setted by assigning recent migrants to their historical ""enclaves."""
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~…the validity of this instrument is argued to come from the fact that it captures patterns of migration driven by family and cultural concerns rather than by labor demand.
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~…the instrument assigns newly arriving immigrants to the cities where their countrymen were settled in 1970.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…the most important control variables in this regression are the industry dummies, a(j). Including industry dummies is equivalent to asking how much local skill ratios shift the method by which the same industries produce.

146~D1~V2~Variable~Technologies~"…the main caveat to the results in the current research is that what the author interprets as differences in ""technology"" may also reflect systematic differences in product mix below the level of industry detail observable (four-digit SIC). Among other things, the lesser use of technology in low-skill markets is partly mediated through the greater presence of small plants in those markets, which may indicate the production of more specialty or customized products in those markets."
146~V15~L13~Variable Value~Electrical Machinery~...electrical machinery uses both more technology and more skilled labor than the average SMT-covered industry.
146~D1~V21~Variable~Product Price~…one SMT characteristic included in a limited series of regressions is product price.
146~D4~D4~Dataset~Census of Manufactures~…plant size, measured by a continuous employment variable from the prior-year Census of Manufactures (1987 or 1992), will also be controlled for in some cross-sectional regressions.
146~D1~V21~Variable~Product Price~…though there are only six price categories in the data, they allow further, albeit crude, disaggregation of the data to test whether the use of technology differs across plants producing similar quality products.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~...plant size will also be controlled for in some regressions. In the current context, it is not entirely clear that a plant's size should be controlled for. After all, a plant's size may be endogenous, a channel through which local workforce skills affect the use of technology. Therefore, the regression without size controls is also of interest.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~...plant size will also be controlled for in some regressions. In the current context, it is not entirely clear that a plant's size should be controlled for. After all, a plant's size may be endogenous, a channel through which local workforce skills affect the use of technology. Therefore, the regression without size controls is also of interest.
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…the Surveys of Manufacturing Technology also contain several other plant characteristic variables which will be controlled for in some regression specifications.
146~D1~V21~Variable~Product Price~…one of four plant-level controls included in the fifth 2SLS specification entered as a dummy variable for each category of response.
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~…apportions recent high-school dropout immigrants from g to the cities where all immigrants from that region were living in 1970; it predicts number of dropouts from country g who recently settled in city c.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~...one SMT characteristic included in a limited series of regressions is product price. To capture the possibility that even though there is little international specialization across four-digit industries, countries with a low relative supply of capital or skilled labor may tend to specialize in lower quality products within four-digit industries, the author will include specifications that interact product price categories, indexed by p, with industry.

146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~"…the fraction of city c's recent ""predicted"" immigrants who are dropouts."
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~…the instrument apportions those recent immigrants from each part of the world according to the metropolitan area locations of immigrants from the same part of the world in 1970.
146~D2~V22~Variable~Number of High School Equivalents~…the number of high school equivalents, defined here as the number of workers who are high school graduates plus one-half the number of workers with some college (one to three years college) education, is a commonly used skill aggregate in research on skill biased technological change.
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~"…insturments of this nature are often referred to as capturing the ""supply-push"" part of immigration. The instrument implicity asumes that variation in the national volume of immigrant inflows is driven mainly by variation in conditions in the sending countries, rather than in the destination U.S. markets."
146~D2~V22~Variable~Number of High School Equivalents~"…in this formulation, those with some college education are thought of as supplying labor inputs ""equivalent to"" half a high school educated worker and half a four-year college graduate worker. The qualitative results of this paper do not depend on the weight given to some college workers."
146~D1, D3~V23~Variable~Occupations~…used in order to study the occupations of dropouts in SMT-covered industries (computed using 1990 Census of Population microdata).
146~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~Occupations, Hours Worked, and Educational Attainment~…analysis of the occupations of dropouts in SMT-covered industries shows that dropouts are highly concentrated in labor-intensive production occupations - assemblers, welders, and inspectors - which the automated technologies covered by the SMT might be reasonably argued to replace. Half of dropout worker's hours are concentrated in ten occupations. Immigrant dropouts also work in these same jobs, though they are more concentrated in assembly occupations. In contrast, only 43% of high school educated workers' hours and 26% of some college educated workers' hours (and 7% of college-graduate workers' hours) are in these same jobs - more educated workers have a greater presence in supervisory, managerial, and non-production taks. Also, in a given occupation, high school and some college educated workers ar more skilled - their average wages are higher - and they are likely better equipped to operate newer machines.
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~…an advantage of this instrument is that similarly constructed instruments have been used in other research to demonstrate that local skill ratios have little impact on relative wages but nevertheless have a large impact on skill ratios in narrow industries.
146~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Dropouts Among Predicted Recent Immigrants~…to find out if low-skill workers are attracted to markets where, for some reason, the use of potentially labor-replacing technologies is lower, researchers turn to instrumental variable estimates using this instrument in the 2SLS regressions.
146~D1, D3~V23~Variable~Occupations~…the top ten occupations, by hours worked in 1990, of college graduates in SMT industries are: managers and administrators (18.9%), electrical engineers (9.0%), aerospace engineers (5.7%), sales representatives (4.8%), mechanical engineers (4.4%), computer systems analysts (4.4%), accountants and auditors (4.1%), marketing, advertising and PR managers (3.8%), computer programmers (3.5%), and production supervisors (3.3%).
146~D1, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Count of Immigrants, Region, 5 Years~…represents the count of all immigrants from g who arrived in the U.S. in the past five years (between years t and t-5).
146~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Output~…it is important to emphasize that the outputs of the two technologies Y(T) and Y(M) are perfect substititues - there is only a single good. The price of the good is normalized to 1.
146~D3~T3~Time Period~1970.0~…the year 1970 is a low point in U.S. history for the presence of foreigners in the U.S. population, and largely precedes the modern wave of less-skilled immigration.
146~D3~V24~Variable~Count of Immigrants~…IMM represents counts of immigrants.
146~D3~V24~Variable~Count of Immigrants~…this count is limited to those in the labor force and aged 16 to 65.
146~D3~V24~Variable~Count of Immigrants~"…for 1988, ""recent"" immigrants are in fact defined as those who report having arrived 1980 to 1986. (This is the closest approximation to five years prior to 1988 that can be obtained using the 1990 Census of Population). For 1993, recent immigrants are defined as those who arrived 1988-93, measured using the 2000 Census of Population. Only working age migrants with at least one year of potential work experience and in the labor force are included in the counts. The population weights in each Census were used to compute the counts."
146~D3~V25~Variable~Count of Immigrant Dropouts~…IMMDO represents counts of immigrant dropouts.
146~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Output~…a final loose end is that the cone of diversification exists, i.e., that Y(M) and Y(T) can be both simultaneously greater than zero. This outcome is feasible under the model's assumption that the modern method is relatively skill-intensive.
146~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Count of Immigrant Dropouts, Region, 5 Years~…represents the immigrants from g who arrived in the U.S. in the past five years and who are high schooll dropouts.
146~D3~V25~Variable~Count of Immigrant Dropouts~…this count is limited to those in the labor force and aged 16 to 65.

146~D1, D3, D5~DV21~Derived Variable~Share of Immigrants, City, 1970~…the share of all 16 to 75-year-old immigrants from g- regardless of labor force status or skill - living in a city c in 1970.
146~D3~V26~Variable~Region of Origin~…g indexes region of origin.
146~D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Total Five-Year Immigration of Dropouts~…summing across regions produces the numerator in computing the share of dropouts among predicted recent immigrants, total five-year immigration of dropouts to c predicted on the basis of historical immigrant settlement patterns.
146~D1, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Share of Recent Immigrant Dropouts~…the recent immigration of dropouts to c predicted on the basis of historical immigrant settlement patterns.
146~D1, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Share of Recent Immigrant Dropouts~…shows the share of recent immigrants who were dropouts in 1988 and 1993, computed using 1990 and 2000 public-use microdata.
146~D1, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Share of Recent Immigrant Dropouts~…statistics on the region of origin are shown on the 3,118,709 immigrants who reported arriving in the U.S. between 1980-1986 according to the 1990 Census, while the same statistics are reported on the 3,631,347 immigrants who reported arriving between 1988 and 1993, according to the 2000 Census. Only working-age immigrants (age 16-65 and old enough to have completed reported years of school) not living in group quarters, with at least one year of work experience, and who report being in the labor force are included in these calculations.
146~D3~V26~Variable~Region of Origin~"…there are 16 world regions used to construct the instrument, in other words the ""g"" index in the equation."
146~D1, D3~DV24~Derived Variable~Share of Immigrants from Region g~…shows the share of recent immigrants from each region in 1988 and 1993.
146~D1, D3~DV24~Derived Variable~Share of Immigrants from Region g~…statistics on the region of origin are shown on the 3,118,709 immigrants who reported arriving in the U.S. between 1980-1986 according to the 1990 Census, while the same statistics are reported on the 3,631,347 immigrants who reported arriving between 1988 and 1993, according to the 2000 Census. Only working-age immigrants (age 16-65 and old enough to have completed reported years of school) not living in group quarters, with at least one year of work experience, and who report being in the labor force are included in these calculations.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV25~Derived Variable~Correlation Between the Instrument and Dropouts~…shows the relationship between the instrument and dropouts per high schol equivalent in 1998 or 1993, measured using Current Population Survey merged outgoing rotation group files (MORGs).
146~D1~V27~Variable~Year~…t indexes year.
146~D1, D2, D3~V28~Variable~City~…the city in which an individual lived in 1970, of interest in order to index the location of each respondent of interest.
146~D1, D2, D3~V28~Variable~City~…the locations of workers is more likely to be endogenous.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV25~Derived Variable~Correlation Between the Instrument and Dropouts~…1988 uses the average of the 1987-1989 MORGS, and 1993 uses the average of the 1992-1994 MORGs. Only those of working age (age 16-65) with at least one year of potential work experience who reported being in the labor force were included in the calculation. CPS final person weights were used in the computations.
146~D1, D2, D3~V28~Variable~City~…metropolitan areas in the 1970 Census were constructed using county groups, with a county group included in a metropolitan area's definition if a majority of its population resided inside the 1990 boundaries of the metropolitan area.
146~D1, D2, D3~V28~Variable~City~…the 1970 locations are computed using all immigrants age 16-75, regardless of labor force status.
146~D1, D2, D3~V28~Variable~City~…the biggest loss of metropolitan areas comes from the requirement that each area must be observable in the 1970 Census of Population, which is used to construct the instrument. Another restriction is that there be at least one plant in both the 1993 and 1988 SMT surveys, which knocks out an additional 15 metropolitan areas.
146~D3~D3~Dataset~Censuses of Population~…the locations of immigrants in 1970 are measured using the 1970 Census of Population.
146~D1, D2, D3~V28~Variable~City~…the 22 cities in the current sample that have land-grant colleges are quite regionally diverse.
146~D2, D3~V29~Variable~Mexican~…three-quarters of Mexicans are dropouts.
146~D5~D5~Dataset~U.S. Dept. of Commerce~…1970 County population estimates were obtained from U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (1984).
146~D2, D3~V29~Variable~Mexican~…by far the largest group of recent immigrants in both 1988 and 1993.
146~D1, D6~DV26~Derived Variable~Employment Growth~…for the 1988 regression, employment growth is measured during 1980-86, the same years in which the growth is measured 1988-93 for 1993. This has a correlation of 0.7 with 1983-88 employment growth.
146~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the relationship between the instrument and dropouts per high schol equivalent in 1998 or 1993 is measured using Current Population Survey merged outgoing rotation group files (MORGs).
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F4~Findings~Correlation Between the Instrument and Dropouts F-Statistic Estimate~…when studying the relationship between the instrument and dropouts per high school equivalent in 1998 or 1993, F-stats exceed 60. This strong relationship reveals both the influence that immigration has on local skill supply and the strength of immigrant enclaves in attracting continued migration from the same part of the world, even 20 years later.
146~D1, D6~DV26~Derived Variable~Employment Growth~…employment growth is measured 1988-93 for 1993.
146~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Capital Used in Technology~…K(J) represents capital used in technology J.
146~D2, D3~V29~Variable~Mexican~…the top five cities where Mexicans lived in 1970 were Los Angeles, 32%; Chicago, 7%; Houston, 4%; El Paso, 4%; and Anaheim, 4%.
146~D6~D6~Dataset~County Business Patterns~…employment in total non-farm employment and comes from County Business Patterns county summary files.
146~D3, D6~DV40~Derived Variable~Local Skill Supply and Technology Use~…information on how much the local skill supply affects whether a technology is used is available for a limited number of the technologies in the 1993 survey, and will be used in only some regressions.
146~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Capital Used in Technology~…a dependent variable of interest in the current research is the overall capital intensity of the plant.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the 2SLS regressions use first-stage specifications, though results are robust to using the other specifications. 
146~D1~V16~Variable~Baseline Technology Use~"…the panel approach allows controls for baseline technology use. This control has several interpretations. It captures the ""dynamics"" of technological change: adoption of new technologies often follows and ""S-shared"" pattern over time which can be captured by regressing changes on initial levels. Baseline technology use has another useful interpretation in this case: it can roughly be construed as a lagged change in the use of technology, since adoption of most SMT-technologies occured not long before 1988. Regression specifications which control for technology use in 1988 therefore roughly ask if local influxes of dropout affect plants' trend-adjusted technology adoption."
146~D1~F5~Findings~High Tech Machines Per Employee and Variation in Technologies~"…although summarizing how ""high tech"" a plant is in terms of the number of technologies it uses potentially masks some interesting variation, this simple count turns out to capture nearly 40% of the variation in the individual technologies; factor analysis reveals it to be the principle component."
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…information on how much the local skill supply affects whether a technology is used is available for a limited number of the technologies in the 1993 survey, and will be used in only some regressions.
146~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Capital Used in Technology~…capital intensity in technology is proxied as the log of the (book) value of machinery per employee, constructed from 1987 and 1992 Census of Manufactures data, but using the same sample of plants as in other regression specifications.
146~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Capital Used in Technology~…this dependent variable averages about 10 (=$20,000/employee) at the average employee's plant.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~"…in order to obtain the correct standard errors, the regressions were run in two steps: first, the number of technologies was regressed on plant characteristics and city dummies; second, the estimated city dummies - adjusted city level averages - were regressed on the city's dropout share. Regressions were weighted to be representative of employment; correctly interpreted, therefore, they measure the impact of citywide dropout share on the number of technologies at ""the average employee's plant,"" but nevertheless they will frequently be described as the impact at ""the average plant""."
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…the author assumes, as the Census Bureau did throughout most of the reports they published on the results of the SMT (1989, 1994), that non-response to any technology use question indicates that the plant is not using that technology.
146~D1~V3~Variable~Labor Skill Level~…used in computing the output associated with each type of technology.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the regressions were run across 143 cities for which all the necessary data were available.
146~D1~F6~Findings~Average High Tech Machines Per Employee Over Time~…in 1988, the average employee in the SMT-universe across 143 cities for which all the necessary data were available was at a plant using six of these technologies; by 1993 this had risen only slightly, to 6.2 technologies. Most of the technologies actually declined in use between 1988 and 1993; the growth in use is confined to computer-based technologies. In both 1988 and 1993 there is also wide variation across plants in the use of technology. More than 10% of this variation is accounted for by variation across labor markets, even when holding constant industry mix.
146~DV18~L14~Variable Value~Dropouts per High School Equivalent in SMT Industries~…the dropouts per high school equivalent in SMT industries (SIC 34-38).
146~DV18~L15~Variable Value~Dropouts per High School Equivalent in the City's Labor Force~…the dropouts per high school equivalent in the city's labor force overall (for the current sample of cities).
146~D1, D3, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Less-Skilled Labor Supply and Capital Intensity~…the author evaluates whether the less-skilled labor supply influences a continuous measure fo the capital intensity of plants.
146~D5~V30~Variable~County Population~…1970 County population estimates were obtained from U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (1984).
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…the regressions were run across 143 cities for which all the necessary data were available.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…the first row of estimates shows OLS estimates with no additional controls. The second row of estimates then controls for detailed industry, dividing SMT plants into 161 four-digit industries. To further control for product quality within industry, the third row interacts four-digit industry with the product-price categories (inspired by Schott (2004)).
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Baseline OLS Estimates~…in demonstrating the OLS estimates with no additional controls. The coefficient -4.67 for 1988 says that when the relative supply of dropouts rises by 10 percentage points -slightly less than one standard deviation - the average plant in the city uses 0.467 fewer technologies. A similar estimate is obtained in the 1993 data. This relationship may partly reflect differences in industry mix across locations: areas with more unskilled labor may have more low-technology types of industries. The second specification therefore controls for detailed industry, dividing SMT plants into 161 four-digit industries. This does not weaken the relationship! Even within narrow industires, therefore, the use of these technologies varies strongly with the local skill share. When controlling for product quality within industry, the influence of local skill supply continues to be robust to controls for this proxy for product in both 1988 and 1993.
146~D1~V30~Variable~Nature of Manufacturing Process~…one of four plant-level controls included in the fifth 2SLS specification entered as a dummy variable for each category of response.
146~D1, D2, D3~DV29~Derived Variable~Correlation between Dropouts per High School Equivalent in SMT Industries Against Dropouts per High School Eqivalent in the City's Labor Force~…plots dropouts per high school equivalent in SMT industries (SIC 34-38) against the dropouts per high school equivalent in the city's labor force overall (for the current sample of cities).
146~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Producer's Problem~…the producer's problemn can be solved by computing the minimum cost of producing a unit of output with each technology, given factor prices.
146~D1, D3~DV30~Derived Variable~1970 Mexican Share~…to find out if low-skill workers are attracted to markets where, for some reason, the use of potentially labor-replacing technologies is lower, researchers turn to instrumental variable estimates using an estimate of the 1970 Mexican share in the 2SLS regressions.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…to find out if low-skill workers are attracted to markets where, for some reason, the use of potentially labor-replacing technologies is lower, researchers turn to instrument variables estimates, using the share of dropouts among predicted recent immigrants instrumental, and the 1970 Mexican share.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F8~Findings~Baseline 2SLS Estimates~…two-stage least squares estimates factoring in instrument variables are larger than the OLS estimates. In other words, if anything dropouts differentially live in markets with higher technology use, biaising OLS estimates toward zero. It may also be that immigration-induced less-skilled labor supply has a larger impact on technology use than less-skilled labor supply generally, a point discussed further below.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the last three rows of Table 7 present specifications with other plant-level controls. The fourth row shows a specification which controls also for plant employment, entered as a sixth-order polynomial. The next row adds the first four plant-level controls - plant age, nature of manufacturing process, product price, and product market - entered as dummy variables for each category of response. The next row adds military contractor variables. Other controls are available only in the 1993 SMT. It asked about foreign ownership and how much of a plant's production was exported to foreign countries. These controls have little impact on estimates. Also available are controls on the nature and difficulty of worker training and whether research and development occurs at the plant. These controls have little impact on the estimates as well.
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…the SMT asked about foreign ownership and how much of a plant's production was exported to foreign countries. These controls have little impact on 2SLS estimates.  Also available are controls on the nature and difficulty of worker training, and whether research and development occurs at the plant. These controls have little impact on estimates as well.
146~D1, D3, D6~F9~Findings~Plant Level Controls and Relative Less-Skilled Labor Supply~…when plant-level controls, including plant age, nature of manufacturing process, product price, and product market, are entered as dummy variables for each category of response, the coefficient on the skill supply variable remains significant in all four result columns.
146~D1~V30~Variable~Initial Plans For Technology Acquirement~…another available control is plant's initial plans for adding technology in the next five years, asked in the 1988 SMT survey. Firms were not asked about whether they planned to reduce the use of technology.
146~D1~V30~Variable~Initial Plans For Technology Acquirement~…controlling for plant's plans allows the researcher to find out if increases in the availability of unskilled labor cause firms to deviate from their initial plans for technological upgrading.
146~D1~V30~Variable~Nature of Manufacturing Process~…available in both 1988 and 1993.
146~D1~V31~Variable~Product Market~…one of four plant-level controls included in the fifth 2SLS specification entered as a dummy variable for each category of response.
146~D1~V31~Variable~Product Market~"…""What is the average market for MOST of the products of this plant?"" Available in both 1988 and 1993."
146~D1~V32~Variable~Percent Shipped to Federal Defense Agencies~…the percent of product shipped to federal defense agencies as a more accurate indicator of military contractor status. Available in 1988 and 1993.
146~D1~V33~Variable~Foreign Ownership~…available in the 1993 SMT is an indicator for whether a plant has foreign ownership.
146~D1~V32~Variable~Percent Shipped to Prime Contractors of Federal Defense Agencies~…the percent of product shipped to prime contractors as a more accurate indicator of military contractor status. Available in 1988 and 1993.
146~D1~V33~Variable~Foreign Ownership~"…""Does a foreign entity (company, individual, government, etc.) own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock or other equity rights in this plant?"" Available in 1993 Only."
146~D1~V34~Variable~Export Share~…available in the 1993 SMT is a control for how much of a plant's production was exported to foreign countries.
146~D1~V34~Variable~Export Share~"…""What percent of this plant's total value of shipments are exported for direct sale? Include shipments to foreign subsidiaries."" Available in 1993 Only."
146~D1~V35~Variable~Training Location~…available in the 1993 SMT are controls on the nature and difficulty of worker training.
146~D1~V35~Variable~Training Location~"…one might interpret this control as a proxy for ""friction"" which may affect the adoption of new technology and be correlated with skill shares."
146~D1~V35~Variable~Training Location~"…""Where is most of the forma training for staff of this plant conducted?"" Available in 1993 Only."
146~D1~V36~Variable~Training Personnel~…available in the 1993 SMT are controls on the nature and difficulty of worker training.
146~D1~V36~Variable~Training Personnel~"…one might interpret this control as a proxy for ""friction"" which may affect the adoption of new technology and be correlated with skill shares."
146~D1~V36~Variable~Training Personnel~"…""Who conducts most of the formal training for staff of this plant?"" Available in 1993 Only."
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~"…a continuous mesaure of the use of these technologies is available in the 1993 survey. For a limited number of technologies, the 1993 survey asked plants to report the ""number of dedicated workstations (or items of equipment)."" The technologies covered by this question include computer aided desing, engineering, and manufacturing; numerically controlled machines; materials working lasers; pick and place and other robots; programmable controllers; and computers used for control on the factory floor. These make up more than half of the technologies in use at the average worker's plant in 1993. "
146~D1~DV31~Derived Variable~High Tech Machines Per Employee~"…a continuous mesaure of the use of these technologies is available in the 1993 survey. For a limited number of technologies, the 1993 survey asked plants to report the ""number of dedicated workstations (or items of equipment)."" The technologies covered by this question include computer aided desing, engineering, and manufacturing; numerically controlled machines; materials working lasers; pick and place and other robots; programmable controllers; and computers used for control on the factory floor. These make up more than half of the technologies in use at the average worker's plant in 1993. Using this, the researcher created a measure of technological intensiveness, ""high tech machines per employee,"" equal to, for each plant, the number of machines (summed across these technology categories) divided by plant employment."
146~D1~F10~Findings~Average Worker Plant in 1993 and Average High Tech Machines Per Employee~…the average worker's plant in 1993 used roughly one machine per nine employees. However, many plants used zero machines per employee.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…this method is used to show estimates with the dependent variable equal to high tech machines per employee.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F11~Findings~High Tech Machines as the Dependent Variable and Regression Results~…when high tech machines per employee is set to be the dependent variable in 2SLS regressions, all of the estimates are negative and sizeable, though they are imprecisely estimated. Interestingly, controls for plant size do not reduce the coefficient in this case.
146~D1, D2~DV32~Derived Variable~Share of High School Graduates~…to the end that one might also wish to examine more finely the impact of relative supply of those higher levels of education, the author also runs regressions of the number of technologies on the share of the labor force with only a high school degree.
146~D1, D2~DV32~Derived Variable~Share of High School Graduates~"…this variable predicts quite strongly the share of high-school and some college-educated workers in the metropolitan areas in the sample. However, it can only weakly predict the college graduate share of an area's labor force, rendering inference about the effect of four-year college graduate relative supply from these instruments impossible. A reason for this weak first stage is that the proportion college educated among immigrants and native-born Americans is very similar: there is no relative college gradute ""supply shock"" associated with immigration."
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…in order to determine the how less-skilled labor supply affects the use of capital intensive methods generally, researchers run 2SLS regressions using as the dependent variable the log of the (book) value of machinery per employee, constructed from 1987 and 1992 Census of Manufactures data, but using the same sample of plants.
146~D1, D2~DV33~Derived Variable~Share with Some College~…to the end that one might also wish to examine more finely the impact of relative supply of those higher levels of education, the author also runs regressions of the number of technologies on the share of the labor force with some college but no four-year degree.
146~D1, D3, D6~F12~Findings~Capital Intensity and Relative Less-Skilled Labor Supply~…estimates show that capital intensity is indeed strongly negatively associated with the local less-skilled labor supply, a relationship which the available controls do not eliminate.  
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the last alternative specification of this method controls for the number of technologies in use (entered as dummies).
146~D1~V37~Variable~Hiring Difficulty~…available in the 1993 SMT are controls on the nature and difficulty of worker training.
146~D1~F13~Findings~Number of Technologies and Future Use of Machinery~…when the number of technologies in use is controlled for in 2SLS regressions, the addition reduces the magnitude of the coefficient, though it remains marginally significant. In addition to reducing the use of the particular technologies covered by the SMT, less-skilled labor supply reduces relative use of machinery generally.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…to the end that one might also wish to examine more finely the impact of relative supply of those higher levels of education, the author also runs regressions of the number of technologies on the share of the labor force with only a high school degree, some college but no four-year degree, and a four-year college degree. Again, the author uses the impact of historical immigration patterns to produce arguably exogenous variation in local skill shares. The author constructs immigrants in manner similar to the construction of the share of dropouts with recent predicted immigrants but insted divide recent inflows of immigrants into three education groups. To alleviate the problem that these instruments can only weakly predict the college graduate share of an area's labor force, the author adds to the list of instruments a dummy for whether or not the metropolitan area has a land-grant college.

However, it can only weakly predict the college graduate share of an area's labor force, rendering inference about the effect of four-year college graduate relative supply from these instruments impossible. A reason for this weak first stage is that the proportion college educated among immigrants and native-born Americans is very similar: there is no relative college gradute ""supply shock"" associated with immigration."
146~D1, D2~DV34~Derived Variable~Share with a Four-Year College Degree~…to the end that one might also wish to examine more finely the impact of relative supply of those higher levels of education, the author also runs regressions of the number of technologies on the share of the labor force with a four-year college degree.
146~D1, D2~DV34~Derived Variable~Share with a Four-Year College Degree~"…this variable predicts quite strongly the share of high-school and some college-educated workers in the metropolitan areas in the sample.

146~D1, D2, D3~DV35~Derived Variable~Volume of Recent Immigrant Arrivals of Labor Force Participants with High School Education~…represents the volume of recent immigrant arrivals of (labor force participants with) a high school level of education.
146~D1, D2, D3~DV36~Derived Variable~Volume of Recent Immigrant Arrivals of Labor Force Participants with Some College Education~…represents the volume of recent immigrant arrivals of (labor force participants with) some college education.
146~D1, D2, D3~DV37~Derived Variable~Volume of Recent Immigrant Arrivals of Labor Force Participants with Four-Year College Graduate Education~…represents the volume of recent immigrant arrivals of (labor force participants) with at least a four-year college graduate level of education.
146~D1~DV38~Derived Variable~Product Quality~…in order to clarify the interpretation of the results, the author controlled for a crude measure of product quality within industry.
146~D1~DV39~Derived Variable~Percent of Hours Worked by Occupation Group~…among those working in industries covered by the SMT, figures show the percent of hours worked by members of the group identified (e.g. immigrant high school dropouts) employed in the given occupation.
146~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Factor Prices~…the producer's problemn can be solved by computing the minimum cost of producing a unit of output with each technology, given factor prices. Factor prices are reported for less-skilled labor, skilled labor, and capital.
146~D1~V37~Variable~Hiring Difficulty~"…one might interpret this control as a proxy for ""friction"" which may affect the adoption of new technology and be correlated with skill shares."
146~D1~V37~Variable~Hiring Difficulty~"…""How difficult has it been to hire skilled personnel to work with the technologies used in this plant?"" Available in 1993 Only."
146~D1~V8~Variable~Land-Grant College~…to alleviate the problem that education-level instruments can only weakly predict the college graduate share of an area's labor force, the author adds to the list of 2SLS instruments a dummy for whether or not the metropolitan area has a land-grant college.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…each results column in first stage regression results summarizing the impact of education-level shares among recent immigrants and the presence of land-grant colleges represents a separate regression for a different education share (in 1988 or 1993).
146~D1, D3, D6~F14~Findings~Relative Supply of Education and Land Grants Over the Relevant Period~…the relative supply of a particular education level in an area in 1988 or 1993 is positively associated with 1970 concentrations of immigrants with a high relative supply of that education level. Diagonal elements in the results table are positive, while off-diagonals are generally negative or insignificant. The immigrant instruments, however, have little association with college-educated share. The presence of a land-grant college is associated with a significantly (5 percentage point) higher college-educated share in an area and does not predict the high school or some college shares. Nevertheless, the first stage overall remains somewhat weak for college-educated workers.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…OLS estimates examining more finely the impact of educational attainment represent specifications with different controls. All regressions control for industry effects.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…2SLS estimates examining more finely the impact of educational attainment represent specifications with different controls. All regressions control for industry effects.
146~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Educational Attainment Shares over 2SLS and OLS Specifications~…in 2SLS and OLS estimates of the impact of educational attainment, the coefficients on some college and high school shares are generally large and of similar magnitude, while the coefficient on college graduate shares tends to be small and is frequently not distinguished from zero. As in previous specifications, controls for price categories within industry provide no systematic evidence that this relationship is driven by within-industry product heterogeneity. Size controls absorb a significant part of the relationship, and other plant-level controls have a lesser impact.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~"…shows estimates of the impact of less-skilled relative labor supply on the five subcategories of technology in equivalent ""per technology"" terms. All of the estimates control for industry effects, and for reference, the impact on the average technology's use overall is shown at the top of the table (i.e., it just repeats the relevant estimates from Table 7 but divides by 17)."
146~D1, D3, D6~F16~Findings~Impact of Less-Skilled Labor Supply Across the Five Technology Subcategories~"…when estimates are shown of the impact of less-skilled relative labor supply on the five subcategories of technology in equivalent ""per technology"" terms, the coefficients are not statistically distinguishable from each other."
146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…a nice feature of the SMTs is that some plants were sampled in both years, which allows the researcher to first difference at the plant level using a balanced panel - that is, researchers examine how the same plants change their use of technology when the local skill supply changes.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…an advantage of panel regressions is that they implicity remove any unobserved (fixed) attributes of a plant (or city) which affect its use of technology. By itself, however, this approach could still be biased by plant attributes whos influence is changing over time (say, if there were differential trends in technology adoption across industries). Therefore, it still may be important to control for baseline plant characteristics. A disadvantage is that requiring that plants appear in both datasets reduces the sample size considreably, and may produce a sample which overrepresents large plants. Sample weights will be adjusted to partially addresss this representation issue.

146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~"…the panel approach allows controls for baseline technology use. This control has several interpretations. It captures the ""dynamics"" of technological change: adoption of new technologies often follows and ""S-shared"" pattern over time which can be captured by regressing changes on initial levels. Baseline technology use has another useful interpretation in this case: it can roughly be construed as a lagged change in the use of technology, since adoption of most SMT-technologies occured not long before 1988. Regression specifications which control for technology use in 1988 therefore roughly ask if local influxes of dropout affect plants' trend-adjusted technology adoption."

146~D1~V8~Variable~Land-Grant College~…land-grant colleges came into existence after 1862, when Congress passed the Morrill Act, giving states land that allowed them to fund the creation of university-level agricultural schools. Given this long lag from the founding of these schools until now, and their original purpose of providing support for agriculture, it is not unreasonable to think that the location of these schools is unrelated to unobserved determinants of the skill composition of demand today.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…another available control is plant's initial plans for adding technology in the next five years, asked in the 1988 SMT survey. The dependent variable in the regression is a net change in the number of technologies in use, while the control is only for technologies that firms planned to add.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…another available control is plant's initial plans for adding technology in the next five years, asked in the 1988 SMT survey.

146~D1~D1~Dataset~Surveys of Manufacturing Technology~…another available control is plant's initial plans for adding technology in the next five years, asked in the 1988 survey. Firms were not asked about whether they planned to reduce the use of technology.
146~D1~V4~Variable~Research and Development~…available in the 1993 SMT is a control for whether research and development occurs at the plant.
146~D1~F17~Findings~Initial Plans For Technology Acquirement and Actual Realization in High Tech Machines per Employee~…plants' plans for adding technology considerable overstated how much they ended up adding - on average plants forecasted an increase of three technologies in 1988, but the average plant had only 0.2 more technologies in 1993. nevertheless, plans correlate positively with realized changes in the use of technology: a regression of planned additions on actual has a slope coefficient of roughly 0.25. however, this coefficient alone is not an accurate test of how well firms forecast future technology-use plans.
146~D1~V4~Variable~Research and Development~"…one might interpret this control as a proxy for ""friction"" which may affect the adoption of new technology and be correlated with skill shares."
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~"…OLS regression results for a panel of 1,474 establishments which could be observed in both the 1988 and 1993 surveys are reported. In order to correct for the fact that the dropout share varies only across cities, errors are clustered at the city level. In order to correct for the fact that the panel overrepresents large plants, the weights are adjusted to make the panel dataset representative of 1988 employment in the same two-digit industry by class size by metropolitan area cells used in earlier specifications. Reweighting cannot completely fix the representation issues because many cells are ""lost"" - they have no observations in the panel sample - typically plants in the smallest class size (20-99 employees)."

146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…the first row of OLS panel estimates shows results of regressions with no controls. The second row adds in 17 dummies for plants' 1988 use of technology, which absorbs one-quarter of the variation in technological change across plants and reduces the standard errors considerably. The third specification adds four-digit industry controls. As a safeguard against the probability that the observed effect derives partly form the impact that changes in dropout share have on changes in industry mix, estimates in the fourth row also include controls for four-digit industry in 1993. The fifth specification adds a control for the number of technologies plants reported in 1988 that they planned to add in the next five years. The subsequent rows of the table add in other baseline controls.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…the first row of IV panel estimates shows results of regressions with no controls; the instrumental variable estimates use the share of dropouts among predicted recent immigrants. The second row adds in 17 dummies for plants' 1988 use of technology, which absorbs one-quarter of the variation in technological change across plants and reduces the standard errors considerably. The third specification adds four-digit industry controls.

The subsequent rows of the table add in other baseline controls.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F18~Findings~OLS and 2SLS Estimates Without Controls~…when OLS and IV estimates are reported with no controls, both the OLS and 2SLS estimates are negative and similar to the cross-sectional estimates. Unfortunately, the standard errors are also quite large, a problem of working with such a small sample when you have a noisy dependent variable.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F19~Findings~OLS and 2SLS Estimates With Technology Controls~…adding technology controls raises the panel OLS and 2SLS point estimate a bit, indicating that the less-skilled labor supply grew faster in places which, based on initial levels of technology use, one would have expected to have had a relatively large amount of technology adoption -places that had low technology use initially.
146~D1~F20~Findings~High Tech Machines Per Employee and Technological Growth~…the plants with more technology in 1988 saw slower growth in technology use 1988-93: there was convergence across plants in technology use. If one runs the linear version, the coefficient on the lagged number of technologies is -0.44.
146~D1, D3~F21~Findings~First-Stage Regression Coefficient and Share of Mexicans in 1970~…the first-stage regression coefficient is 0.23, with an F-stat of 25. Share of Mexicans in 1970 does not enter significantly as an instrument here.
146~D1, D3~F22~Findings~Number of Technologies and Dropout Shares~…adding the number of technologies for a plant as a control does not reduce the coefficient on the change in dropout shares. Influxes of less-skilled workers caused firms to scale back from their initial plans for adding technologies.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~OLS~…finally, as a specification check, researchers regress plants' plans to add technology in the next five years on the future change in dropout share. The purpose of this is to test whether the negative relationship between technology use and dropout share found so far is driven by the endogenous differential migration of less-skilled workers to markets where technological change was expected to be slower. These specifications use the 1988 cross-section sample and weights. The dependent variable is now the number of technologies plants reported in 1988 they would add by 1993. The last row adds controls for the number of technologies in use in 1988, which was found above to be an important determinant of technology addditions 1988-1993.

146~D1, D2, D3, D4~F23~Findings~OLS and 2SLS Specification Check Regression Results~"…in the specification check regressions, all OLS estimates are positive, though not statistically signifiant. IV estimates, which use the same instruments as the 1993 cross-section regressions above are also positive, of similar magnitude, and statistically insignicant. This is a reassuring finding, supporting the idea that the direction of causality does indeed run from skill supply to technology use and not the other way round. If anything, dropouts weakly favor future ""high-tech"" markets. It is not clear why this would be the case, but it is consistent with a bias toward zero in the OLS estimates."
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F24~Findings~Overall Relationship between Relative Supply of Less-Skilled Labor and Automation Use ~…in all of the analysis presented in this paper, a higher local relative supply of less-skilled labor was associated with lower use of manufacturing automation technologies at otherwise similar plants. This was true in both cross section and in first differences. The effect was larger when using variation in local skills supplies generated by arguably exogeneous historical patterns of immigration. There are a number of reasons why IV estimates might be larger than OLS estimates. One is that immigrant less-skilled labor supply may have a greater impact on technology use than overall less-skilled labor supply. In addition, because new immigrants tend to follow previous waves of immigrants to the same designation, an increase in the presence of less-skilled migrants tends to raise the less-skilled labor supply not only now, but also in the future.
146~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~2SLS~…any attenuation of the OLS estimates due to measurement error is eliminated in the IV regressions.

147~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…using the Current Population Survey or PUMS to analyze the taxes and benefits received by immigrant individuals or immigrant-headed households in a given year is misleading, because current United States immigrant individuals are disproportionately of working age and pay more in taxes than they cost in benefits, while calculating based on immigrant households is also misleading, because United States born children of immigrants count only while they live with their immigrant parents and once they have matured into the labor force and head their own households, their tax payments are excluded.

147~D1, D4~F1~Findings~Initial Fiscal Impacts of Immigrants~…the initial fiscal impact of immigrants are negative, as the immigrant sends children to school and has low earnings in the years soon after arrival.
147~D1, D4~F2~Findings~Fiscal Impact Break-Even Point for Immigrants~…the fiscal impact of immigrants turns positve after 16 years (although no fiscal adjustment occurs before 2029, and then only for OASDI).

147~D1, D2, D3, D4~F3~Findings~Federal Impact of 100,000 Per Year Immigrant Stream~…when projecting the impact in each future year of increasing the immigrant stream by 100,000 per year from now on, maintaining the composition of the current year stream, the federal impact of immigrants is always positive and rising, but even after 75 years it amounts only to about 0.7% of federal revenues.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~F4~Findings~State/Local Impact of 100,000 Per Year Immigrant Stream~…when projecting the impact in each future year of increasing the immigrant stream by 100,000 per year from now on, maintaining the composition of the current year stream, the state/local impact of immigrants is always negative but never exceeds 0.5% of state/local revenues.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~F5~Findings~Total Impact of 100,000 Per Year Immigrant Stream~…when projecting the impact in each future year of increasing the immigrant stream by 100,000 per year from now on, maintaining the composition of the current year stream, the total impact is initially negative but becomes positive after several decades, and it is always small relative to total taxe revenues.
147~D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Impacts~…summarized by calculating its effect on the actuarial balance, the present value of tax revenues less costs, plus the initial trust-fund balance minus the present value of costs in 2075, all divided by the present value of payroll over the next 75 years.
147~D3, D4~F6~Findings~Current Impact and Potential Improvement~…the impact is currently -2.07%, and we find that 100,000 more net immigrants would improve it by positive 0.06%, similar to the Social Security Trustees' projected positive 0.07% effect, a small difference most likely arising because the Trustees treat immigrants of a given age as identical to natives in earnings and fertility whereas the researchers in this paper give them their actual earnings distribution and fertility.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Single Immigrant Consequences~…the projected consequences for a single immigrant can be summarized by calculating the net present value over various time horizons up to 300 years.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~300 Year Time Horizon Net Present Values in 1998 Dollar Amounts~…when analyzing the net present values for a single immigrant across time horizons up to 300 years, state/local impacts are always negative ranging from -$39,000 for 25 years to -$32,000 for 300 years, whereas federal impacts are always positive with federal impact growing strongly as the horizon lengthens from $27,000 for 25 years to $131,000 for 300 years.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~F8~Findings~Increased Productivity Growth Impact on Net Present Value~…researchers project one scenario in which productivity grows at 2.6% per year, and consequently, the OASDI tax increase is delayed by eight years relative to baseline until 2036, and the general federal tax increase is dealyed by six years until 2054; in this case the net present value of a composite immigrant in 1998 rises from $99,000 to $266,000, suggesting that the higher productivity growth means that immigrants also receive higher wages and pay higher taxes, eventually receiving higher retirement benefits as well.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Single Immigrant Consequences~…although the future is highly uncertain, it is clear that the consequences of immigrant can only be projected over very long time horizon as some United States born children of immigrants arriving today will still be alive 130 years from now.
147~D1, D2, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Tax Impact of 100,000 per Year Immigrant Stream on Nonimmigrants~…researchers find that 100,000 more immigrants per year would initially raise taxes for nonimmigrants, and later reduce them, by amounts less than 1% at the current tax levels, while costs will be much heavier for states and local areas that receive many incremental immigrants, while states with few immigrants should reap the advantages of reduced federal and OASDI taxes without bearing the local costs of education and health care for immigrants.

148~D2~D2~Dataset~State Agencies~…most individual state agencies have released projections within the past two years and, therefore, incorporate more recent population estimates, including for the years spanning the Great Recession. As such, they are likely more reliable than the Census Bureau proejctions.

148~D2~D2~Dataset~State Agencies~…based on state agency projections for nearly every state, the population segment of people older than 65 is expected to increase as a share of each state's total population by more than 5% by 2030 (Maine and North Carolina are projected to see their shares increase by more than 10%.) The projections suggest that states currently having the largest shares of their populations 65 and older will continue to have the largest share through 2030. These states include Florida, Maine, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. by 2030, about one in four residents of these states may be a retiree.

148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…annual population growth in the United States is expected to slow from about 1% in the 1980s and 1990s to a little more than 0.6% from 2011 to 2030. This slowdown will stem primarily from the combination of a decreasing birth rate and an increasing death rate, the latter due to the aging of the population.
148~D2~D2~Dataset~State Agencies~…growth rates are projected to vary across states. For example, populations in Arizona and Colorado are projected to grow 1.5% or more annually from 2011 to 2030, continuing a trend over the last three decades of fast growth due to in-migration. Over the same period, population growth in Maine and Pennsylvania is expected to reamin close to zero, continuing the historical trends in these states of grwoth rates below the national average.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…average income tax revenue from individuals varies across age cohorts, as taxpayers' incomes and rates of labor force participation change with age.
148~D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Wage and Salary Earnings~…average wage and salary income tends to rise over a worker's career. Initially, these sources of income may increase as people early in their working lives move from part-time to full-time jobs that make better use of their skills and education. Once workers move into the full-time labor force, many increase their earnings by gaining experience, earning promotions, or switching to higher-paying jobs at other firms or organizations.
148~D1, D2, D4~V4~Variable~Retirement~…retirement typically takes one of two forms: retiring from full-time to part-time work or completely exiting the labor force.
148~D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Wage and Salary Earnings~…shows the rise and fall of average income across worker's progressive life stages, with average income in 2011 rising from $13,793 (for ages 15 to 24) to $51,169 (for ages 45 to 54), and then declining to $25,417 (for those older than 75).
148~D1, D4~V5~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…labor force participation rates vary dramatically by age. Only 55% of the 16-to-24 population participated in the labor force in 2011, by either being employed or actively looking for a job. Participation rates peaked for those 35 to 44 with almost 83% participating. At retriement, participation rates fell sharply, with only 26.4% of those 65 to 74 and 7.5% of those 75 and older remaining in the labor force.
148~D1, D4~V5~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…labor force participation rates have changed over the years, primarily driven by an increase in participation among women and a decrease among men. However, since the mid-1980s, labor force participation rates have trended upward for people older than 65, who began retiring later or taking part-time jobs as a bridge between full-time employment and full retirement.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…income tax collection generally follow the distribution of wage income across age groups. Income tax collections are lowest for young workers aged 15 to 24, many of whom work part time and earn entry level salaries. Tax collections increase for older workers, peaking among 45- to 55-year-olds then falling as workers begin to retire.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…most states that assess individual income taxes have collections that follow the pattern of rising and then falling across age cohorts. However, different tax structures and distributions of taxpayer earnings produce variation across states. The degree to which different states' tax structure causes some variation. Under more progressive tax structures, higher earners - who tend to be concentrated in middle-aged cohorst - pay a higher share of taxes than lower earners in the younger and older age cohorts. In California, where tax rates range from 1.0% to 13.3%, the highest-earning age cohort - 45 to 54 - on average pays 2.2 times as much as the 25 to 34 cohort. In contrast, in Colorado, which has a flat tax rate, the 45 to 54 cohort pays 1.8 times more in taxes than the 25 to 34 cohort. In addition, many state have tax policies that lower the effective income tax rate for older individuals. For example, 36 states did not tax Social Security income in 2011, and many states do not tax some pension and retirment.
148~D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Wage and Salary Earnings~…the distribution of wage and salary earnings varies across states. For example, in Connecticut young workers 25 to 34 earned on average 59.5% as much as the highest-earning group (45 to 55), while in Mississippi young workers earned 93.6% as much as earners 45 to 55.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…age demographics affect sales tax collections. With the rise and fall of consumer spending across age cohorts, sales tax revenue also falls.
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~...although consumers typically smooth consumption somewhat throughout their lifetimes by borrowing early in life and spending from savings later in life, consumer spending still follows a pattern of rising then falling, similar to that of income. As with income, spending historically has peaked for middle-aged cohorts, while younger and older individuals have spent considerably less. 
148~DV2~L6~Variable Value~Shelter~…average spending on shelter and food represent a comparable share of spending across age cohorts.
148~DV2~L11~Variable Value~Food at Home~…average spending on shelter and food represent a comparable share of spending across age cohorts.
148~DV2~L7~Variable Value~Healthcare~…healthcare costs, in particular, rise as a share of total spending as consumers age.
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…middle-aged people typically have the highest levels of consumer expenditures. In 2011, spending was highest on average among those 45 to 54, propped up by the highest levels of spending on entertainment of all age cohorts. Spending was also highest for education, presumably on college expenses for the cohort's children. Spending was also elevated for those 35 to 44, due to higher average spending on apparel, housing, and transportation.
148~DV2~L8~Variable Value~Insurance and Pensions~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~DV2~L9~Variable Value~Shelter and Food~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~DV2~L10~Variable Value~Cash Contributions~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~DV2~L11~Variable Value~Food at Home~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~DV2~L12~Variable Value~Education~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~DV2~L13~Variable Value~Taxable Expenditures~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~DV2~L13~Variable Value~Taxable Expenditures~…taxable expenditures are defined by the authors to include expenditures commonly taxed across the states, including spending on apparel, transportation, entertainment, personal care products, food away from home, alcohol, tobacco products, reading material, housing costs except shelter and miscellaneous expenditures.
148~DV2~L7~Variable Value~Healthcare~…one of seven taxable expenditure categories of interest in the Census Bureau's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…on average, spending by those younger than 25 and those older than 75 was slightly more than half of that of middle-aged consumers. While those older than 75 have historically spent the least on average, their expenditures in the past several decades have risen. In recent years, spending by the 75-and-older cohort has exceeded average spending for those younger than 25. From 1984 to 2011, average real spending rose 35.8% for those older than 75 compared to 4.5% for all consumers. 
148~DV2~L7~Variable Value~Healthcare~…healthcare spending makes up almost 14% of total spending among people older than 75, a higher share than all other age cohorts. This share of expenditures has remained fairly constant over the past three decades.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…although sales tax collections over the average U.S. taxpayer's life time follow a patterns similar to that of overall spending (rising until middle age and then falling in older age), state revenue trends vary because tax structure differ in the goods and services that states tax.
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…currently, 45 states assess sales taxes on general retail transactions, with rates ranging from 2.9% in Colorado to 7.5% in California. Most of these states assess sales taxes on apparel, transportation, entertainment, personal care products, food away from home, alcohol, tobacco products, reading material, housing costs except shelter, and miscellaneous expenditures.
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…tax exemptions differ across states. Prescription medicines are expempt in nearly all states. Groceries are exempt in 31 states and the District of Columbia, but not in 19 other states. The exemption of services, prescription drugs, food, and services from taxation in many states has important implications for sales tax collections as the population ages. 
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…sales taxes have traditionally been assessed primarily on goods, but some services also are taxed. The number of services taxed varies widely by state with Hawaii, New Mexico, and South Dakota having much broader tax bases by taxing more services.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…as people age and spend less, a greater share of their spending tends to go to services and prescription drugs which are often tax-exempt. Thus sales tax collections from the elderly may fall faster than their total spending.
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…as people age and spend less, a greater share of their spending tends to go to services and prescription drugs which are often tax-exempt. Thus sales tax collections from the elderly may fall faster than their total spending.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…in addition to individual income and sales taxes, state and local governments rely on a variety of other tax sources including property taxes, corporate income taxes, severance taxes, and estate taxes. For most states, these sources make up a much smaller share of total revenue and, with the exception of estate taxes, are less likely to be directly or heavily infuenced by an aging population.
148~V1~L15~Variable Value~Property Tax Revenues~…although local governments rely heavily on property taxes, most states do not collect a significant amount of revenue from this source, which represents just 1.9% of total state tax revenue. Older individuals typically spend less on housing, and many states offer property tax exemptions or credits for lower-income, elderly individuals. These factors may reduce property tax collections for this cohort.
148~DV2~L13~Variable Value~Taxable Expenditures~…older individuals typically spend less on housing.
148~V1~L17~Variable Value~Corporate Tax Revenues~…corporate income taxes are not likely to be directly affected by an aging population and instead are much more closely related to the business cycle.
148~V1~L18~Variable Value~Severance Tax Revenues~…severance income taxes are not likely to be directly affected by an aging population and instead are much more closely related to the business cycle.
148~V1~L19~Variable Value~Estate Tax Revenues~…state collections from estate taxes are likey to increase as the population ages, but these collections are typically assessed only on high-wealth individuals and make up less than 1% of state tax collections.
148~V1~L20~Variable Value~Gift Tax Revenues~…state collections from gift taxes are likely to increase as the population ages, but these collections are typically assessed only on high-wealth individuals and make up less than 1% of state collections.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the analysis in this paper focuses on individual income and sales taxes due to the expected effect of aging on these sources of revenue and the importance of these tax sources for state government revenue.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…the analysis in this paper focuses on individual income and sales taxes due to the expected effect of aging on these sources of revenue and the importance of these tax sources for state government revenue. However, other revenue sources may play a stabilizing role in total tax revenue collections as the U.S. population ages. Also taxes are not the only source of government revenue. Intergovernmental transfer payments, insurance and pension trust funds, and receipts from nontax charges all contribute to state government revenues.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…provides an empirical analysis of the projected effect of an aging population on state's individual income tax collections. State level population projections are applied to current income tax patterns to project how agina lone might affect individual income tax revenue in each state by 2030, holding all other factors constant.
148~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Population Projections~…in the analysis portion of this research, state-level population projections are applied to current income tax patterns to project how aging alone might affect individual income tax revenue in each state by 2030, holding all other factors constant.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~F1~Findings~Demographic Changes and Income Tax Revenue Per Capita~…the analysis suggests that isolating the impact of an aging population and holding all other factors (such as income growth, tax structures, and other variables) constant, demographic change alone from 2011 to 2030 will likely reduce income tax revenue per capita by 2.4% across all the states and the District of Columbia.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the analysis here allows for comparisons across states, accounting for regional differences in demographic and tax structures and identifies a number of considerations for policymakers for interpreting results.
148~D2~D2~Dataset~State Agencies~…state-level data can be used to project the effect of demographic change on individual income tax revenues.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~F2~Findings~Projected Per Capita Income Tax Collections and Projected Total State Income Tax Revenues~…even though per capita income tax collections are projected to fall in most states, total state income tax revenues are projected to increase in more than half of these states due to an increase in the total population.
148~D3~D3~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…this data source allows the computation of average expenditures separated by expenditure category by age cohort for the year 2011.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~T1~Time Period~2011.0~…main observed survey year of interest in the current research paper.
148~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~2030.0~…main predicted survey year of interest in the current research paper.
148~D2, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Projected Percent Change in State Individual Income Tax Revenue~…provides the projected percent change from 2011 to 2030 in state individual income tax revenue per capita for each state obtained by isolating the effect of an aging population on tax revenue and holding all other factors (such as income growth, tax structures and other variables) constant. Shown in Chart 4.
148~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Projected Percent Change in Total State individual Taxes Due to Demographics~…shows the projected percent change in total state individual income taxes due to demographic change alone from 2011 to 2030. Shown in Chart 5.
148~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Population Projections~…provides a summary of projected percent change in population from 2011 to 2030. Shown in Appendix Table A1.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Individual Tax Revenue Projections~…individual income tax revenue projections are provided using both census and state agency projections to examine how differences in populations projections might alter results. Estimates based on census population projections are shown in the gray outline, and estimates based on population projections from state agencies are shown in the blue bars for those states that make projections publicly available.
148~D1, D2, D4~F3~Findings~Population Projections and Income Tax Estimate Differences~…in many cases, there is a significant difference in the two income tax estimates driven by large differences in the population projections. For example, Maine showed the largest difference between Census Bureau and state agency estimates of average per capita tax revenue growth - ranging from -9.1% to -3.7%, holding all else equal.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Individual Tax Revenue Projections~…these projections were derived by comparing estimates of state individual income tax revenues in 2011 to estimates for 2030.
148~DV5~L21~Variable Value~Current State Individual Income Tax~…to obtain estimates of current state individual income tax revenues, the estimated average per capita state income tax liabilities for each age cohort were multiplied by 2011 population levels.
148~DV5~L22~Variable Value~Future State Individual Income Tax~…similarly, the same average per capita state income tax liabilities used to compute current state revenues were multiplied by Census Bureau and state agency population projections for the year 2030 for each state to produce projections of state individual income tax revenues in 2030.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Income Tax Revenue Share~…individual income tax revenue as a share of total tax revenue for 2011.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Income Tax Revenue Change Per Person~…the projected change in per capita state individual income tax revenue from 2011 to 2030 estimated for both the state-level agency data and the aggregate Census Bureau data.

148~V3~L27~Variable Value~Washington~…this state's residents are not subject to individual income tax.
148~V3~L28~Variable Value~Wyoming~…this state's residents are not subject to individual income tax.
148~V3~L29~Variable Value~New Mexico~…New Mexico is not included in tax revenue projections due to a known error in the CPS data for that state.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Individual Tax Revenue Projections~…author's calculations using pooled data from the March 2011 and 2012 ASEC of the Census Bureau's CPS, 2011 Census Bureau population estimates, 2005 interim census population projections, and population projections from state agencies.
148~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…individual income tax revenue projections are computed, in part, from pooled data from the March 2011 and 2012 ASEC of the Census Bureau's CPS.
148~D4~T3~Time Period~2011, 2012~…pooled Current Population Survey data is drawn from the March ASEC from 2011 and 2012.
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…individual income tax revenue projections are computed, in part, from 2011 Census Bureau population estimates and 2005 interim census population projections.
148~D1~T1~Time Period~2011.0~…relevant year from which population estimates are drawn from the Census Bureau.
148~D1~T4~Time Period~2005.0~…survey year from which interim census population projections are drawn from the Census Bureau data.
148~D2~D2~Dataset~State Agencies~…individual income tax revenue projections are computed, in part, from population projections from state agencies.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Income Tax Revenue Share~…across the states, individual income taxes comprised 34.1% of total state tax revenue. However, dependence on this revenue source varies across states.
148~V3~L30~Variable Value~Tennessee~…in Tennessee, income tax is only applied to capital gains from dividends and interest and to inheritance income. In this state, income tax revenue makes up a considerably smaller share of total revenue than in the remaining 41 states (i.e. excluding the seven states that do not tax individual income and New Hampshire) and the District of Columbia with an income tax.
148~V3~L31~Variable Value~New Hampshire~…in New Hampshire, income tax is only applied to capital gains from dividends and interest and to inheritance income. In this state, income tax revenue makes up a considerably smaller share of total revenue than in the remaining 41 states (i.e. excluding the seven states that do not tax individual income and Tennessee) and the District of Columbia with an income tax.
148~V3~L30~Variable Value~Tennessee~…in this state, individual income tax is limited to capital gains and inheritance.
148~V3~L31~Variable Value~New Hampshire~…in this state, individual income tax is limited to capital gains and inheritance.
148~D1, D2, D4, D5~F4~Findings~Tennessee, New Hampshire, and Idaho~…Tennessee and New Hampshire are among the three states with projected growth in revenue per capita, as income from interest earnings, dividends, and capital gains generally rises with age. The remaining state, Idaho is projected to have particularly strong population grwoth for those aged 35 to 54. Growth in these cohorts, which have the largest tax liability on average in Idaho, results in a slight increase in average per capita income tax revenue for the state.
148~D1, D2, D4~F5~Findings~Demographic Change and Virginia's Per Capita Income Tax Revenue~…demographic change alone is projected to reduce Virginia's per capita income tax revenue by 8.4% based on state agency projections. The average income tax liability for those over 65 in Virginia was zero in 2011 and 2012, likely reflecting the state's exemption for Social Security income and deduction of up to $12,000 for seniors.
148~D1, D2, D4~F6~Findings~Projected Tax Collection Growth and Projected Population Growth~…strong overall growth in state income tax collections is projected in states like Arizona and Colorado that expect fast population growth. In contrast, state demographers in Maine and Pennsylvania are expecting populations to remain fairly flat, contributing to the overall projected decline in total income tax revenue for those states.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the results in this analysis rely heavily on the assumption that on average for each age cohort income tax liabilities will remain constant over time. Underlying the latter assumption are the assumption that for each cohort average income and labor force participation will remain constant, and state tax policies will not change - an unlikely scenario given historical precedence. Each of these factors could affect actual state income tax collections and should be considered when interpreting these results.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Income Tax Revenue Change Per Person~…the results in this analysis rely heavily on the assumption that on average for each age cohort income tax liabilities will remain constant over time. Underlying the latter assumption are the assumption that for each cohort average income and labor force participation will remain constant, and state tax policies will not change - an unlikely scenario given historical precedence. Each of these factors could affect actual state income tax collections and should be considered when interpreting these results.
148~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Population Projections~…the predictive capacity of the analysis relies on the accuracy of the population projections.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the predictive capacity of the analysis relies on the accuracy of the population projections. 
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…because Census Bureau projections are somewhat dated, they may be less reliable than more current state-level projections. For example, Census Bureau projections will likely underproject population growth in states such as Wyoming and North Dakota that experienced fairly dramatic population growth in the years following the release of the latest projections.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…comparing results from state agencies to Census Bureau projections demonstrates the sensitivity of the analysis to the projections used.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Projected Labor Force Participation~…future changes in labor force participation rates could affect future income tax revenues. If participation rates continues to decline for men under 65 and women under 25 as they have since 1980, income tax collections will likely be lower than projected. At the same time, if labor force participation rates continue to increase among men 65 and older and among women over 25, income tax collections from these cohorts will likely be higher than projected.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Individual Tax Revenue Projections~…future changes in labor force participation rates could affect future income tax revenues. If participation rates continues to decline for men under 65 and women under 25 as they have since 1980, income tax collections will likely be lower than projected. At the same time, if labor force participation rates continue to increase among men 65 and older and among women over 25, income tax collections from these cohorts will likely be higher than projected.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Projected Labor Force Participation~…one reason that labor force participation rates may continue to increase among older cohorts is an expected increase in life expectancy.
148~D1~V3~Variable~Life Expectancy~…the Census Bureau projects that the life expectancy at birth for non-Hispanic, white men will increase from 76.8 in 2010 to 79.9 in 2030 and to 83.2 by 2060.
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…the Census Bureau projects life expectancy.
148~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Real Average Income~…since 1980, real average income has grown 1.55% per year for workers age 65 and older, 1.23% for workers 55 to 64, and less than 0.9% for all other age cohorts.
148~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Real Average Income~…future changes in income distributions across age cohorts will likely affect income tax revenue to states.
148~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Inflation~…historically, average U.S. incomes have outpaced inflation. For instance, from 1980 to 2011 nominal income increased 4.25% annually on average, while inflation increased 3.3% annually.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the results in this analysis rely on current tax collections to project future tax collections, in effect holding changes in income and income tax liabilities constant. However, if incomes and income tax liabilities inrease at a faster pace than the prices of the goods and services that state governments buy, then real income tax collections may be higher than the results of this analysis suggest.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Income Tax Revenue Share~…the results in this analysis rely on current tax collections to project future tax collections, in effect holding changes in income and income tax liabilities constant. However, if incomes and income tax liabilities inrease at a faster pace than the prices of the goods and services that state governments buy, then real income tax collections may be higher than the results of this analysis suggest.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Income Tax Revenue Share~…a number of factors could influence per capita income tax revenue outside of demographic change and changes in income or labor force dynamics. These include changes to state income tax structures and changes in economic activity that affect income patterns across age cohorts.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Individual Tax Revenue Projections~…as states frequently alter their tax structures and incomes are subject to the business cycle, actual tax collections will likely differ from the projections in this analysis.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…as states frequently alter their tax structures and incomes are subject to the business cycle, actual tax collections will likely differ from the projections in this analysis.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…while many factors could alter the effect that an aging population has on individual income tax revenues, the analysis in this research provides useful insights for policymakers. In particular, an aging population is likely to put downward pressure on individual income tax collections on a per capita basis. Additionally, general population growth plays an important role in the future of tax revenue for states. States that grow the most are likely to experience the highest total revenue growth regardless of demographic change.
148~D1, D2, D3~F7~Findings~Demographic Changes and Sales Tax Revenue Per Capita~…using population projections through 2030 and current expenditure patterns, the analysis in this section projects that demographic change alone - if all other factors are held constant - will reduce sales tax revenue per capita in 49 states and the District of Columbia by 2030. Total revenue from all taxpayers will grow in most states due to population growth, while taxes paid per person will decline. 
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…tax trends result from the fact that most people dramatically reduce their consumption at retirement age (Banks, Blundell, and Tanner; Hurd and Rohwedder). This dramatic decline in consumption with age has important implications for sales tax revenues, which comprise a significant share of state government revenue for most states.
148~D1, D2, D3~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…sales taxes, including general sales and selective sales taxes, comprised 48.4% of total tax revenues across all states in 2011. In the five states that do not impose a general sales tax, selective sales tax collections still comprise from 4.6% to 38.6% of total tax revenue.
148~D1, D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Sales Tax Revenue Share~…of the 45 states with general sales tax, total sales tax dependency ranged from 30.6% in North Dakota to 83.6% in South Dakota.
148~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~Aging Population and Average Taxable Expenditures~…isolating the effect of an aging population, average taxable expenditures are projected to decline on a per capita basis in all but one state from 2011 to 2030, holding all other factors constant. Across all states, average taxable expenditures per capita are expected to fall 0.5% compared with what they would have been absent demographic changes. Despite a projected decline in per capita sales tax revenue, projected increases in population in most states over the next 20 years are estimated to drive total sales tax revenue, resulting in higher total sales tax collections across most states.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Individual Tax Revenue Projections~…tax revenue projections were reached by multiplying Census Bureau and state agency population projections by average estimated taxable consumption expenditures by age cohort using data from the Census Bureau's 2011 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES).
148~DV2~L13~Variable Value~Taxable Expenditures~…because data for actual sales tax liabilities are not available by age cohort, estimated taxable expenditures were used in the analysis. Estimated taxable expenditures are assumed to include expenditures commonly taxed across the states, including spending on apparel, transportation, entertainment, personal care products, food away from home, alcohol, tobacco products, reading material, housing costs other than shelter (such as utilities and furniture), and miscellaneous expenditures.
148~D3~D3~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…source of the average estimated taxable consumption expenditures by age cohort using data from the Census Bureau's 2011 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES).
148~D3~D3~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…because of the small sample size of the CES, state-level estimates of the expenditures by age cohort are unreliable.
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…because of the small sample size of the CES, state-level estimates of the expenditures by age cohort are unreliable.
148~DV2~L13~Variable Value~Taxable Expenditures~…as a result of the unreliability of the CES state-level estimates of the expenditures by age cohort, average nationwide taxable expenditures for each age cohort were multiplied by the 2011 population estimates and 2030 projections for each state.
148~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Sales Tax Revenue Share~…sales tax revenue as a share of total state tax revenue for 2011.
148~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Sales Tax Revenue Change Per Person~…the projected chnges in per capita taxable expenditures from 2011 to 2030.
148~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Sales Tax Revenue Share~…total share of sales tax revenue from state sales taxes to show each state's relative dependence on this revenue source, and a summary of taxable expenditure projections per capita obtained by isolating the effects of an aging population on tax revenue and holding all other factors (such as expenditure patterns, tax structures, and other variables) constant. Shown in Chart 6.
148~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Projected Change in Total Taxable Expenditures~…shows the projected change in total taxable expenditures by state from 2011 to 2030 due to demographic change alone. Shown in Chart 7.
148~D1, D2, D3~F9~Findings~Aging Population and Per Capita Taxable Expenditures~…of the states imposing a sales tax, the impact of an aging population alone on per capita capita taxable expenditures is projected to range from a decline of 3.3% for Hawaii to a 0.2% increase for Idaho, the only state with a projected increase. States with the largest per capita decreases, including Hawaii, Colorado, north Carolina, and Maine, tended to have large cohorts aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 in 2011. In these states, population growth for younger cohorts is not projected to compensate for lower levels of consumption as these large cohorts enter retirment.
148~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Census Bureau vs. State Agency Projections~…results using Census Bureau population projections are within 1% of those using available state agency projections for most states. The largest difference between projections occurs for Tennessee, where results range from a per capita revenue decline of 2.4% using Census Bureau projections to a decline of 0.6% using state agency projections, holding other factors constant. This equates to a $399 difference in estimates of average spending per person, the largest dollar difference of any state.
148~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~Taxable Expenditures vs. Population Growth~…total taxable expenditures are projected to grow at a magnitude similar to population growth. Among the projections from state agencies, Arizona and Colorado are projected to have the strongest total revenue growth from 2011 to 2030 due to population increases greater than 30% in these states. Only Pennsylvania and Maine are expected to see their population fall through 2030, though projected population declines are by less than 1% over this period. These two states and Ohio are projected to see total taxable expenditures fall.
148~DV2~L13~Variable Value~Taxable Expenditures~…results rest on the assumption that average taxable expenditures are consistent across states and will remain constant over time on average for each age cohort.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…results rest on the assumption that average taxable expenditures are consistent across states and will remain constant over time on average for each age cohort.
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…state tax structure and consumption patterns differ and change over time. Also, out-of-state spending and business spending influence revenues. Each of these factors could influence the sensitivity of state sales tax revenue to an aging population.
148~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~Total Taxable Expenditures vs. Per Capita Taxable Expenditures~…comparing results using data from 1991 relative to the 2011 expenditure data used in this analysis shows the importance of taking shifts into account. For example, total taxable expenditures across all states were projected to increase only 10.7% based on 1991 data, instead of 12.1% based on 2011 data. Per capita taxable expenditures were projected to decrease 1.7%, compared to 0.5%.
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…differences in state structures will influence the sensitivity of sales tax revenue to demographic change to the degree a state's tax base relies on expenditures from the retired population. For example 14 stats include food expenditures in their tax base These expenditures make up a larger share of total spending for the retired population than other goods.
148~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~Food at Home and Per Capita and Total Taxable Expenditures~…per capita and total taxable expenditures increase by 0.1 across all states when food at home is included as a taxable expenditure. The increase is as high as 0.3% for Wyoming taxable expenditures per capita and 0.2% for total taxable expenditures using Census Bureau population projections.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…the total effect of an aging population on state tax revenues will depend on its effects on both individual income taxes and sales taxes, and it will also depend on the degree to which a given state relies on each of these two sources of income.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~F14~Findings~Individual Income Tax Revenue and Sales Tax Revenue Share of Total Tax Revenue~…for the nation, individual income tax revenue contributed 34.1% to total tax revenue, and general selective sales tax revenue contributed 48.4% in 2011.
148~D1, D2, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Aging Effect on Total Tax Revenue~…the projections derived earlier regarding expected effects of demographic on income taxes and sales taxes can be used to quantify the effect of aging on total tax revenue.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~F15~Findings~Aging Population and Individual Income Tax Revenue and Sales Tax Revenue~…an aging population alone - holding all other factors constant (such as income growth, expenditure patterns, tax structure and other variables) - is expected to reduce individual income tax revenue by 2.4% per person by 2030. An aging population is expected to have less effect on consumer expenditures and therefore sales tax revenues, falling just 0.5% per person by 2030. Combining these effects, if the U.S. population had the projected age composition of 2030 in 2011, total state tax revenues would have been $8.1 billion, or approximately 1.1%, lower. However, care should be taken when interpreting such estimates due to the many consideratins included in this analysis.
148~D2, D3, D4~F16~Findings~Alaska vs. Hawaii~…the effect of aging populations varies widely across states because of the vast differences among the states in their reliance on income tax revenue and sales tax revenue. In Alaska, individual income taxes and sales taxes combine, contribute only 4.6% to total state tax revenue. By contrast, these two sources make up 94.$% of total tax revenue in Hawaii. Therefore, the negative effects of an aging population on total state tax revenues are likely to be much higher in Hawaii compared with Alaska.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~F17~Findings~Aging Population, Demographics, and Individual Income Tax Revenues vs. Sales Tax Revenues~…an aging population will likely have varying effects on individual income tax revenues and sales tax revenues depending on each state's current age composition, projected population growth, and tax structure. For example, among the states with state agency population projections, per capita individual income tax revenues are projected to increase by 19% due to demographic change alone in Tennessee because only capital gains and interest income are taxed in that state. In every other state, isolating the impact of an aging population on revenue is expected to reduce per capita income tax revenues - ranging from a 0.5% decline in Rhode Island to a 10.5% decline in North Carolina.
148~D2, D4~F18~Findings~Per Capita Sales Tax Revenue Variation Across States~…variations exist across states for per capita sales tax revenues. Among states with state agency population projections, per capita sales tax revenues projections range from a 0.1% decline in Rhode Island to a 2.7% decline in Maine.
148~V1~L15~Variable Value~Income Tax Revenues~…individual income taxes are generally more progressive than sales taxes, meaning that higher income earners pay a larger share of their income in taxes.
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…sales taxes are frequently regressive, meaning that lower-income individuals pay a higher share of their income on taxes.

148~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Population Projections~…Census Bureau state population projections for the year 2030, as published in 2005, were compared to 2011 Census Bureau population data. Notably, the 2030 projections are projected from a 2004 base year. As such, they fail to reflect more recent actual population data.
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…Census Bureau state population projections for the year 2030, as published in 2005, were compared to 2011 Census Bureau population data. Notably, the 2030 projections are projected from a 2004 base year. As such, they fail to reflect more recent actual population data.
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…figures reflecting both general sales tax revenue and selective sales tax revenue, are based on data for fiscal year 2011 from the U.S. Census Bureau.
148~V1~L14~Variable Value~Sales Tax Revenues~…figures reflecting both general sales tax revenue and selective sales tax revenue, are based on data for fiscal year 2011 from the U.S. Census Bureau.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…although individual income and sales tax revenue makes up more than 80% of state tax revenue, states also receive revenue from sources other than taxes. As a percentage of all state government revenue (both tax and nontax revenue), individual income and sales taxes combine account for 28%.
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…the Census Bureau continues to release population projections by age for the nation as a whole, allowing comparisons at the national level of population projections released in 2005 and 2012.
148~D2~D2~Dataset~State Agencies~…at the time of publication, state agency population projections by age for 2030 were only publicly available for 35 states.
148~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Population Projections~…at the time of publication, state agency population projections by age for 2030 were only publicly available for 35 states.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…in a majority of states, most revenue from individual income taxes is based on earnings from salaries and wages. Additional revenue flows from taxes on capital gains and inheritances such as income from interest, dividends, and estates. Unlike wage and salary income, average income from capital gains, taxable interest, and dividends continues to increase after retirement.
148~D5~D5~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…according to 2008 data from the Internal Revenue Service, average federal taxable net capital gains, taxable interest, and dividends increase dramatically from age cohorts younger than 35 to those in the 35-to-44 age cohort and continue to increase for older cohorts. Although these three income sources make up less than 3% of income for tax filers aged 18 and 34, they make up about 35% of income for those who are 65 and older.
148~D1, D4~V5~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…labor force participation rates increased from 59.2% in 1950 to a high of 67.1% in 1997. The increase in participation was primarily due to increased participation among women - almost 34% of women in 1950 compared to 59.8% in 1997. Changes to men's participation were less drastic, but most age groups have experienced a decline in participation over the past 60 years. Notably, the participation of men ages 16 to 24 fell from 68.2% in 1950 to 56.8% in 2010, and participation dropped from 41.6% yo 22.1% for men over 65 (based on data from the Census Bureau).
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…average expenditures by age group were adjusted to 2011 dollars using the U.S. consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U).
148~V3~L23~Variable Value~Alaska~…states without a general sales tax include Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. These states do, however, impose selective sales taxes on items such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.
148~V3~L46~Variable Value~Delaware~…states without a general sales tax include Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. These states do, however, impose selective sales taxes on items such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.
148~V3~L62~Variable Value~Montana~…states without a general sales tax include Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. These states do, however, impose selective sales taxes on items such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.
148~V3~L31~Variable Value~New Hampshire~…states without a general sales tax include Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. These states do, however, impose selective sales taxes on items such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.
148~V3~L70~Variable Value~Oregon~…states without a general sales tax include Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. These states do, however, impose selective sales taxes on items such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.
148~V1~L15~Variable Value~Income Tax Revenues~…to reducing sampling error, individual level income tax data is pooled from the Annual Social and Economic Supplements of both the 2011 and 2012 Current Population Surveys (CPS) conducted by the Census Bureau. For this data the average state income tax liabilities after credits are calculated for each state and for each age cohort.
148~D1~D1~Dataset~Census Bureau~…population estimates for 2011 are the most recent available population data from the Census Bureau.
148~D1, D2~F19~Findings~State Population Projection MAPE~…the state population projections for 2000 with a base year of 1995 had a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.6% when compared to the actual 2000 census population count. This is an imporvement when compared to earlier projections as various studies found a MAPE error of around 3% to 5% for five-year projections made between 1955 through 1980.
148~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Population Projections~…state population projections are affected by errors similar to national population projections such as birth, mortality, and net migration rates as well as an unanticipated shift in socioeconomic trends.
148~D1, D4~V5~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…participation rates increased from 19% in 1980 to 22.1% in 2010 for men age 65 and older, while rates fell for men in every other age cohort. For women, labor force participation rates have increased in all age cohorts over age 25 since 1980 but still remain below rates for men.
148~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tax Revenues~…data are not current available that distinguish business or out-of-state spending from in-state resident spending. As a result, it is difficult to quantify how much tourism or business spending contributes to a given state's tax base and how much this might impact the results of this analayis. 
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…some business and tourism spending is likely included in the exenditure estimates used in this analysis. However, estimates do not take into account the location or reason for expenditures.
148~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Expenditures~…estimates of consumption expenditures used in this analysis are for individuals. As such, they may not adequately reflect dependency relationships, where individuals consume on behalf of another person, such as spouse, dependent child, or elderly adult. changes in dependency patterns over time could influence expenditure patterns and sales tax revenue over time and should be considered when interpreting results.
149~149: Income Redistribution in a Common Labor Market~~~~
149~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…assumes a common labor market in which at least some portion of the work force is able to switch from jobs in one jurisdition to jobs in another jurisdiction within the time frame of the anlysis, and possibly at a nonzero cost.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…with a common labor market, changes in redistributive policy in one jurisdiction have effects throughout the system, as migration flows equilibrate incomes net of taxes and transfers within bounds set by migration costs in all jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…an important feature of the common labor market assumption is the endogenous determination of wages in all jursidictions.
149~D2~V1~Variable~Wages~…wages in a common labor market adjust in response to changes in the labor supply, and these adjustment serve to equilibrate migratory flows.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…this common-labor-market specification is most appropriate when considering migration by middle- and high-income households in response to interjurisdictional tax differentials or migration of poor individuals in temporary spells of poverty, perhaps associated with unemployment resulting from a job layoff or a weak initial attachment to the labor market, if young.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…this assumption of a common labor market is the main feature from which differentiates the present analysis from earlier work.
149~D2~V2~Variable~Governmental Units~…there exist two types of governmental units in the model underlying this research, namely, a central government and a system of lower-level governments.
149~V2~L1~Variable Value~Lower-Level Governments~…in the United States context, the lower-level governments might be the states, whereas in the European context they might be the member states of the EEC.
149~V2~L2~Variable Value~Central Government~…in the United States context, the central government would be the federal government, and, in the European case, it could be the EEC itself.
149~V2~L1~Variable Value~Lower-Level Governments~…lower-level jurisdictions are indexed into households in each and is endowed with a Ricardian technology, giving the output of a numeraire good as a strictly increasing and concave function of the number of poor employeed there.
149~D2~V3~Variable~Households~…the households in each jurisdiction are aggregated into two groups.
149~V3~L3~Variable Value~Immobile~"…the first group consists of of immobile households, corresponding to ""rich"" households in this research."
149~V3~L4~Variable Value~Mobile~"…the second group consists of mobile households, corresponding to ""poor"" households in this research."
149~D2~V4~Variable~Households~…the roles of the rich and poor can be interchanged without substantially affecting the analysis, however because most prior literature focuses on the case in which the poor are mobile and the rich are immobile, the same case is considered explicitly here.
149~V1~L5~Variable Value~Poor Wages~…poor households receive a gross wage equal to their marginal productivity.
149~V1~L6~Variable Value~Rich Wages~…rich households obtain the remaining income generated by the productive activity of the poor, which they capture in the form of rents.
149~V1~L6~Variable Value~Rich Wages~…rents may literally be rents to land or other natural resources but could also include the return to any labor inputs provided by the immobile households.
149~V1~L6~Variable Value~Rich Wages~…as long as this labor is treated as being immobile and inelastically supplied, the equilibrium return to the labor of the rich may be aggregated with the returns to any other fixed factors, and the aggregate return to the rich will be given by the residual.
149~D2~V5~Variable~Total Number of Poor~…the total number of poor in the economy.
149~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Total number of Poor Initially Located in a Specific Jurisdiction~…the total number of poor initially located in a particular jurisdiction.
149~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Jurisdiction Migration~…the amount of individuals migrating into a specific jurisdiction.
149~D2~L4~Variable Value~Mobile~…not all poor households need be assumed mobile; it is only essential that there be some households that are mobile, at the margin, in each jurisdiction.
149~D2~L4~Variable Value~Mobile~…mobile households are assumed to be costlessly mobile.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…denotes the subsidy paid to the poor in a particular jurisdiction, external or internal.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…the reseacher assumes that it is impossible to discriminate between migrants and nonmigrants in the distribution of social benefit, so that all poor households must be treated symmetrically; this is in accordance with the policy of states in the United States, and member states of the EEC are also prohibited from providing social benefits in a way that discriminates against non resident (in practice, of course, there may be may indirect ways to discriminate against migrants).
149~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Net Income of a Poor Household~…equal to the marginal productivity of poor households plus the subsidy paid to the poor in the particular jurisdiction in which the poor household is located.
149~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Net Income of a Poor Household~…the poor are assumed to care only about their consumption of the numeraire commodity and, therefore, to seek to maximize their net incomes.
149~D2~L4~Variable Value~Mobile~…free mobility therefore implies that, inall jurisdictions where the poor locate in equilibrium, their level of consumption must be the same.
149~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Net Income of the Poor~…denotes the equilibrium net income or consumption level of the poor, which is the same for all  jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Income of a Rich Household~…the net income of the rich in a particular jurisdiction is equal to their grow income minus taxes.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…taxes are used to measure the net income for rich households.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…these taxes are used to finance subsidies to the poor and to support expenditures by the central government.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…the central government may subsidize the income-redistribution activities of lower-level jurisdictions through either lump-sum or matching grants.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…to avoid complicartions associated with tax distortions, all taxes are assumed to be lump-sum in nature.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…the net lump-sum tax assessed by the central government on the rich in a particular jurisdiction.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…taxes paid by the poor are suppressed for notational simplicity; however, they are implicitly present in the subsidy term.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…this variable should be interpreted as transfers to the poor net of any taxes that they pay.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…in the European context, this measure would correspond to the national contribution to the EEC net of any pure lump-sum grants received back from it, while in the U.S. context, this measure would correspond to federal income taxes paid by the rich.
149~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Effective Subsidy Rate~…the effective subsidy rate for a particular jurisdiction embodied in any matching grants offered by the central government.
149~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Effective Subsidy Rate~…the share of incremental redistributive expenditures in a particular jurisdiction that is financed by central government grants.
149~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Income of a Rich Household~…the rich are assumed to be altruistic toward the poor and, therefore, to be willing to incur tax liabilities to support redistributive transfers to the poor.
149~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility Function~…denotes the utility function of the rich in a particular jurisdiction with utility always being greater than zero.
149~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility Function~…since equilibrium net income or consumption level of the poor is the same for all porr households due to the free mobility, the utility function does not need to distinguish between the welfare of the poor in a particular jurisdiction itself and the welfare of the poor in some other jurisdiction.
149~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility Function~…it might seem reasonable to consider the case in which the rich have utilitarian preferences with respect to the poor initially located in their own jurisdiction; however, in this case, the utility function would not need to be altered as this is just a special case of the function.
149~D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Central Government Policy Instruments~…must be chosen so as to balance the central-government's budget.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the model in this research does not explicitly allow for nonwage components of real income in the form of locational amenities such as climate, environmental quality, and the like, nor does it allow for noncash public goods and service to influence migration decisions.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the model in this research appears to carry the strong implication that money incomes for all poor households, inclusive of cash transfers, must be completely equalized across jurisdictions; however, some of the observed interjurisdictional variation in money income can be attributed to compensation differentials for quality of life variations.
149~D2~V7~Variable~Output of Numeraire~…the output of numeraire in a particular jurisdiction.
149~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Amenity Value~…the monetized value of to any residnt of environmental amenities such as climate or crime.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…represents both the cash benefits and the monetized value of any quasi-private or congestible local public goods such as transportation, public health care, education and so on.
149~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Net Income of a Poor Household~…when subsidies represent both cash benefits and the monetized value of any local public goods, the real net value of a mobile household reflects the benefits and costs of a wide array of local public goods and services and local amenities or disamenities.
149~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Net Income of a Poor Household~..the assumption that this net income is equalized across jurisdictions, under this more general interpretation of the model, certainly does not require that money wages would be equalized.
149~D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Real Income~…when the output of numeraire in a particular jurisdiction and the monetized value to any resident of environmental amentities, the production function can then be interpreted as the real income of a worker in a particular jurisdiction, gross of taxes and transfers.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the model in this research aggregates all households into two classes.
149~D2~V3~Variable~Households~…although only two classes are specified in this research, more realistically, there could be several categories of both rich and poor, differing by education or skill level, endowmens of nonhuman resources, demographic characteristics, and so on, however expanding the model in this way would complicate the notation but would not change the essentials of the analysis.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…one one determines the benefits and costs to the rich in a particular jursidiction of that jurisdiction's transfer programs, it is easy to describe the levels of these transfers that would be optimal from their viewpoint.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…the assumption that each jurisdiction's policies are chosen to maximize the welfare of the rich, taking central government policies and the level of transfer payments of the other jursidicitions as given, provides a simple positive theory of transfer payments.
149~D2~Dv3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…redistributive transfer payments made in a specific jurisdiction tend to raise the net income of the poor there, attracting additional households from other jurisdictions.
149~D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Poor Household Distribution~…the general-equilibrium response of the distribution of poor households across lower-level jurisdictions to changes in the transfer payments of a particular jursidiction is obtained by differentiating the number of poor households with respect to subsidies.
149~D1, D2~V8~Variable~Transfer Dependent Welfare Households~..there are three groups whose welfare depends on redistributive transfers in a particular jursidiction.
149~V8~L7~Variable Value~Poor Households~…the welfare of poor households depends on redistributive transfers in the jurisdiction of interest.
149~V8~L8~Variable Value~Local Rich Households Financing Transfers~…the welfare of rich households in a particular jurisdiction who finance the transfers depends on redistributive transfers in the jurisdiction of interest.
149~V8~L9~Variable Value~Outside Rich Households Impacted by Transfers~…the welfare of rich households in outside jurisdictions who are indirectly affected by transfers depends on redistributive transfers in the jurisdiction of interest.
149~V8~L8~Variable Vaue~Local Rich Households Financing Transfers~…transfers alter the net incomes of the rich directly and through general-equilibrium effects, and transfers increase the net income of the poor which benefits the rich in all jurisdictions.
149~V8~L9~Variable Value~Outside Rich Households Impacted by Transfers~…transfers alter the net incomes of the rich directly and through general-equilibrium effects, and transfers increase the net income of the poor which benefits the rich in all jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Rent Change Accruals~…shows the change in rents accruing to fixed factors in each jurisdiction that results from a change in the number of workers there.
149~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Rent Change Accruals~…this term is positive in the destination jurisdiction and negative in the source jurisdiction.
149~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Migrational Impact of Transfer Payments~…shows the change in transfer payments made to the poor resulting from migration.
149~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Migrational Impact of Transfer Payments~…this term is negative in the destination jurisdiction and postivie in the source jurisdiction.
149~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Cost of Paying Higher Benefits~…for the destination jurisdiction, there is an added loss of income equal to the cost of paying higher benefits to the existing population of beneficiaries.
149~V9~L10~Variable Value~External Jurisdiction~…the jurisdiction to which migrating individuals are moving to.
149~V9~L11~Variable Value~Internal Jurisdiction~…the jurisdiction to which migrating individuals are moving away from.
149~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Total Effect of Transfers on the Welfare of the Rich~…the total effect of transfers on the welfare of the rich can now be obtained by differentiating the utility function with respect to the subsidy paid to the poor in a particular jurisdiction and dividing by the marginal utility of income in order to express the resulting welfare changes in terms of real income.
149~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Marginal Benefit and effective Marginal Cost Difference~…shows the difference between the marginal benefits and the effective marginal cost to the rich in a particular jursidiction of a unit increase in the subsidy, ignoring any effects associated with migration of the poor.
149~D1, D2~DV17~Derived Variable~Marginal Benefit~…shows the marginal benefits to the rich of a unit increase in the subsidies paid to the poor in a particular jurisdiction.
149~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Marginal Cost~…shows the marginal cost to the rich of a unit increase in the subsidies paid to the poor in a particular jurisdiction.
149~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Welfare Of the Rich and Gross Wage of the Poor~…shows the effect on the welfare of the rich in a particular jurisdiction of an increase in the gross wage of the poor.
149~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Welfare Of the Rich and Gross Wage of the Poor~…holding subsidies constant, an increase in the gross wage raises the net income of the poor, creating a benefit of MRS for the rich, reduces the rents accruing to the fixed factor by the increase in the wage per worker time the number of workers, and finally changes the tax burden on the rich by the cost of the per-worker transfer payment times the change in the number of poor workers.
149~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Indirect Effect On the Welfare of the Rich and Equilibrium Migration Response to Transfer Payment Increases~…shows the indirect effect on the welfare of the rich in a particular jurisdiction taking into account the equilibrium migration response to an increase in transfer payments.
149~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable ~Indirect Effect On the Welfare of the Rich and Equilibrium Migration Response to Transfer Payment Increases~…the welfare of the rich in a particular jurisdiction is affected by the subsidy increase through migration of the poor and through associated changes in the quilibrium wage of mobile workers.
149~D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Welfare Effect on the Rich and Subsidies~…shows the welfare effect on the rich in an external jurisdiction resulting from an increase in the subsidy.
149~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Jurisdiction~…it is assumed that jurisdictions optimize their own level optimize their own level of transfers taking as given the transfer policies of other jurisdictions.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…the precise levels of redistributive transfers chosen in each jurisdiction depend on the subsidy rates offered by the central government.
149~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Uncorrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~..assume initially that the subsidy rates are all zero, a situation that will be referred to as an uncorrected Nash equilibrium in redistributive transfers.
149~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Uncorrected Nash Equilbrium Spiillover~…in this equilibrium with redistributive transfers, the spillover benefit to an external jurisdiction from an increase in redistributive transfers in the source jurisdiction is measured with only two variables for the source jurisdiction, demand elasticity for poor workers and the size of its labor force of poor workers, and only one variable for the external jurisdiction, namely the level of transfer payments per poor households.
149~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Uncorrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~…if the level of transfer payments per household is 0, then the spillover is 0 as well.
149~D1, D2~Dv22~Derived Variable~Uncorrected Nash Equilbrium Spiillover~…the spillover is fiscal in nature: if the rich in an external distribution do not choose to undertake any redistribution, then changes in redistribution in other jurisdictions do not affect them.
149~V9~L11~Variable Value~Internal Jurisdiction~…the jurisdiction of focus in which natives are directly impacted by population increases due to immigration.
149~V9~L10~Variable Value~External Jurisdiction~…the jurisdiction in which natives are indirectly impacted by population increases due to immigration into a separate jurisdiction of interest.
149~D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Matching Grants~…used to internalize the externalities associated with redistributive policies.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…an increase in subsidies creates an externality for the external jursidiction.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…the burden of the central government budget falls onto the taxpayers in each jursidiction.
149~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~Net External Benefit~…dependent on an increase in ransfer payments.
149~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~Net External Benefit~…a system of grants that correctly internalizes the redistributive externality insures that the net external benefit is equal to zero for all internal jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Corrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~…defined as a vector of subsidies and a vector of transfers such that the net external benefit is equal to zero.
149~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Corrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~…in this equilibrium with redistributive transfers, the level of redistributive transfers chosen in each jurisdiction is identical.
149~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Corrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~…note that no symmetry among the jurisdictions themselves has been assumed here; in particular, the rich in different jurisdictions need not have identical preferences for redistribution, however, the level of redistributive support for the poor must be the same in all jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Corrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~…any given degree of redistribution to the poor can be achieved more efficiently by subsidizing redistribution more heavily in jurisdictions with small redistributive transfers and less heavily in jurisdictions with large transfers, so as to bring these transfer levels closer together and thus reduce fiscal distortions of locational choice; however in the absence of  such corrective subsidies, redistribution will be a socially more costly policy than necessary.
149~DV6~L12~Variable Value~Optimal Subsidy Rates~…with optimal corrective policies, the allocation of labor results in equalization of gross wages across all locations; note that the equalization of transfer payments, while necessary is not a sufficient condtion for efficiency, for example in the case when transfer payments equal 0.
149~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Corrected Nash Equilbrium Spillover~…in a corrected Nash equilibrium with redistributive transfers, the uniform level of redistributive transfers satisfies the Samuelson condition.
149~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Effective Subsidy Rate~…in general, subsidy rates must vary across jurisdictions, depending on preferences, incomes, and technology; the rate of subsidy for redistributive transfers in a corrected Nash equilbrium where this variance does not occur should be high when redistribution is extensive and when the allocation of labor is relatively sensitive to the wage rate
149~D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Ad Valorem Transfer Rate~…expressed in ad valorem terms, the transfer  rate is equal to the amount of subsidies divided by the wage.
149~D1, D2~F1~Findings~EEC Effective Subsidy Rate~…if the number of jurisdictions equals 12 (i.e. the number of EEC member states), the ad valorem transfer rate is equal to 0.25, and short run and long run elasticity for labor are equal to -0.1 and -1, respectively, then the effective subsidy rate is equal to 0.000189 in the short run, and 0.186 in the long run.
149~D1, D2~F2~Findings~US Effective Subsidy Rate~…if the number of jurisdictions equals 50 (i.e. the number of U.S. states) while maintaining the ad valorem transfer rate equal to 0.25 and short run and long run elasticities for labor at -0.1 and -1, respectively, then the effective subsidy rate is equal to 0.20 in the long run, however it is of interest to note by way of comparison that, in the United States, the federal government provides open-ended matching subsidies of between 50% and 80% to support the AFDC payments of each state government.
149~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Effective Subsidy Rate~…it would be possible to develop more detailed estimates of the corrective subsidy rates for a given system of governments by solving the system of equations where net external benefit is equal to 0 for all jurisdictions, using detailed information on transfer payment levels and labor market condtions.
149~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Effective Subsidy Rate~…in general, the corrective subsidy rates will differ across jursidictions.
149~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility Function~…the researcher has interpreted the utility functions as the utility functions of altruistic households only; however, they could alternatively be considered as social-welfare functions for each jurisdictions depending on the net income of the rich and the consumption of the poor, which could represent an amalgamation of the preferences of rich households whose utilities depend on net income and possibly, but not necessarily, on the consumption of the poor and the preferences of the poor, whose utilities depend on income and, possibly, but not necessarily, on the incomes of the rich.
149~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Utility Function~…dependent on the number of poor households initially located in the internal jurisdiction, the income of the rich and the income of the poor, parametrized with concave functions; this equation also specifies for the number of jurisdictions present in the system.
149~V3~L4~Variable Value~Mobile~…the assumption that workers are costlessly mobile can be relaxed without changing the basic nature of the results.
149~D1, D2~DV27~Derived Variable~Migration Costs~…the cost of moving from an internal jurisdiction to an external jurisdiction, or of moving from an external jurisdiction to an internal jurisdiction.
149~D1, D2~DV27~Derived Variable~Migration Costs~…if migration costs are strictly positive, then for some specifications of tastes, technologies, and endowments, no households will migrate in equilibrium, nor will there be incipient migration (i.e. households that are just on the verge of moving).
149~D2~DV28~Derived Variable~Poor Household Consumption~…the consumption for individuals from poor households, i.e. mobile, distincted by internal and external jurisdictions.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…if migration occurs in equilibrium, the welfare levels of the poor in different jurisdictions differ only by the magnitude of migration costs.
149~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Subsidy~…while the welfare of the poor will not be equalized in all jurisdictions in the presense of migration costs, migration equilibrium means that policies to improve the welfare of the poor in one jurisdiction will cause identical changes in the real incomes of the poor in other jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~DV27~Derived Variable~Migration Costs~…if migration costs are sufficiently low, relative to wage differentials, so that migration does occur in equilibrium, then the jurisdictions will be actively linked through migration, and the essential nature of the redistributive externalities is no different from the case of zero migration costs.
149~D2~V3~Variable~Households~…it might be argued, in some circumstances that the attempt by the rich to escape heavy taxation,  rather than the attempt by the poor to capture generous redistirbutive transfers, poses the more severe problem for redistributive policy; in this case, one can simply reverse the roles of the rich and poor in the model, supposing that rich taxpayers can migrate freely across jurisdictions and that the poor are immobile.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…when the roles of the rich and the poor are reversed, the rich pay taxes, represented by values of subsidy less than 0 and the poor capture these taxes through government tax/expenditure programs
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the general model is one in which the net income of mobile households enters the utility function of the immobile households; if the altruistic interdependency between the two types of households is sufficiently strong, positive transfers from immobile to mobile households results, but if the interdependency is not so strong, because the mobile households have high incomes relative to the immobile ones, then negative transfers results.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…two crucial features of the model in this reseach are the existence of a common labor market for at least some of the households that are affected by redistributive activities, either as beneficiaries or as contriubtors, and the existence of some degree of altruistic concern among households, the latter of which is important because it rationalizes the existence of redistributive policies in the model, while the former establishes a market linkage through which the effects of redistribution in one jurisdiction are propogated throughout the population of mobile households.
149~D1~D1~Dataset~Decennial Data~…data on regional per capita incomes in the United States from the Decennial spanning the period from 1880 to 1980. 
149~D1~T1~Time Period~1880-1980~…time period from which decennial data is drawn in order to determine regional per capita incomes in the United States.
149~D1~F3~Findings~Regional Per Capita Income Changes in the United States~…according to Decennial data per capita income in the South was about 45% of the United States average in 1900, while incomes in the Pacific and Northeast regions exceeded the national average by more than 60% and 30%, respectively; these rankings did not change during the next 80 years, however, the interregional differentials were substantialsly eroded during this period. By 1980, per capita income in the South had risen to about 90% of the average, while incomes in the Pacific and Northeast regions were only 5% to 10% above average. If these measured income differentials reflect real income differentials, then their persistence over such a long period could be taken as evidence that neither migration of  labor nor any other market-adjustment mechanism leads to equalization of real incomes over time.
149~D1, D2~V10~Variable~System~…the country of interest for which the researcher includes to force variance in the number of jurisdiction.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…includes 12 jurisdictions.
149~V10~L14~Variable Value~United States~…includes 50 jurisdictions.
149~D2~DV29~Derived Variable~Redistributive Policies~…the redistributive policies of lower-level governments are often supported by explicit or implicit grans from higher-level governments.
149~DV29~L15~Variable Value~Education policy~…primary education and secondary education have historically been provided at the local level.
149~DV29~L15~Variable Value~Education policy~…wide variations in the level of education expenditures across school districts are frequently  viewed as inequitables; consequently, local school expenditures are extensively supported by grants from state governments.
149~DV29~L16~Variable Value~AFDC policy~…within broad limits, each state is free to choose the level of benefits to be granted to its AFDC recipients, and there is in fact wide variation in the level of benefits that states provide.
149~DV29~L16~Variable Value~AFDC policy~…each state receives substantial financial support from the federal government for its AFDC and Medicaid benefits, amounting essentially to an open-ended matching subsidy to the states in which the federal government covers 50% or more of the cost of state welfare expenditures.
149~DV29~L17~Variable Value~FIC Deductibility of State and Local Income Taxes policy~…deductibility encourages states and localities to impose taxes with more progressive rate structures.
149~DV29~L17~Variable Value~FIC Deductibility of State and Local Income Taxes policy~…this operates like an open-ended matching grant with a matching rate that varies with the marginal federal tax rate of the individual taxpayers.
149~D2~DV29~Derived Variable~Redistributive Policies~…illustrate the ways in which higher-level governments support redistribution undertaken by lower-level governments in the United States, consistent with the basic objective of internalizing redistributive externalities.
149~DV29~L16~Variable Value~AFDC policy~…it is noteworthy that the federal matching grant rates to states for AFDC and Medicaid do vary inversely with state per capita incomes: for poor states (like Mississippi), up to 80% of the costs of these programs are covered, while the rate is only 50% for high-income states (such as California).
149~DV29~L16~Variable Value~AFDC policy~…since AFDC benefits are highly correlated with income across states, this formula for determining matching grants does exhibit differentiation among jurisdictions.
149~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…a simple regression of matching grants, the AFDC matching rate for a state (or the District of Columbia) in 1990, on the 1989 level of food stamps and AFDC benefits for a family of three as a percentage of poverty income.
149~D2~F4~Findings~Matching Grants Estimate~…a simple regression of matching grants, the AFDC matching rate for a state (or the District of Columbia) in 1990, on the 1989 level of food stamps and AFDC benefits for a family of three as a percentage of poverty income yields matching grants of 93.49 minus 0.518 (SE= 0.091) times the amount of benefits, and an R-squared equal to 0.399, indicating considerably more generous subsidy rates for states with low benefit levels.
149~D2~D2~Dataset~Janice Peskin (1989)~…the data source used for a simple regression of matching grants, the AFDC matching rate for a state (or the district of Columbia) in 1990, and the 1989 level of food stamps and AFDC benefits for a family of three as a perecentage of poverty income.
149~D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Matching Grants~…calculated with a simple OLS regression with explanatory variables including the matching rate for a state and the amount of benefits for a households.
149~D2~V11~Variable~Matching Rate~…the matching rate for an individual state (or the District of Columbia) in 1990.
149~D2~DV30~Derived Variable~Benefits~…measured as the 1989 level of food-stamp and AFDC benefits for a family of three as a percentage of poverty income.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…these countries are ostensibly integrated economic systems characterized by considerable decentralization of the redistribution function.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…these countries are legally committed to a common labor market.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…according to the Treaty of Rome, these ountries may not deprive citizens of other member states of the employment and social rights and benefits that they extend to their own citizens..
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…citizens of any EEC country are legally entitled to work in any other member state and must be treated identically to native citizens with respect to taxation, social security, family allowances, access to education, and all other social benefits.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…as a practical matter, the degree of uniformity of treatment of native residents and immigrants depends considerably on administrative procedures which can effectively obstruct the provision of at least some social benefits to immigrants if desired.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…redistributive policy undertaken at the national level by member states may be viewed as decentralized redistribution within the broader European context.
149~D2~V6~Variable~Taxes~…a number of EEC have reformed their personal tax structures in the past 10 to 15 years in a way that lowers their progressivity.
149~V10~L13~Variable Value~EEC~…the main fiscal function of the EEC itself is to use revenues collected from member states to subsidize redistributive activities.
150~150: Increasing Residual Wage Inequality: Composition Effects, Noisy Data or Rising Demand for Skill~~~~
150~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…data is used on hourly wages from the May and ORG supplements of the Current Population Survey as opposed to the commonly used March supplement of the Current Population Survey because the latter poorly measures the wages of workers paid by the hour.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Residual Wage Inequality~…changes in the residual wage inequality can be interpreted as evidence of changing skill prices only when both the distribution of unobserved skills and the variance of measurement error are constant over time.
150~D1, D2, D4~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…a standard Mincer-type wage equation where the natural logarithm of the hourly wage rate of an individual at a particular time is the outcome and explanatory variables consist of a vector of observed skills, the return to observed skills and a standard regression residual.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Residual Wage Inequality~…changes in the residual wage inequality are determined through a log-linear equation where these changes are interpreted in percentage terms.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Observed Skills~…a vector of observed skills included as an explanatory variable in computing the residual wage inequality changes over time.
150~D1, D2, D4~V1~Variable~Education~…the education level of an individual respondent included in a vector of observed skills used in order to compute changes in the residual wage inequality.
150~D1, D2, D4~V2~Variable~Labor Market Experience~…the labor market experience of an individual respondent included in a vector of observed skills used in order to compute changes in the residual wage inequality.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Return To Skills~…the return, or price, to observed skills.
150~D1, D2, D4~V3~Variable~Residual~…assumed to be made up of a product of some unobserved skills with the return to unobserved skills and a measurement error term.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Residual Wage Inequality~…simply the measured inequality in the residual.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…the main inequality measure used in this paper because, unlike other popular measures like the difference between the ninetieth and the tenth percentile of log wages, it is a decomposable measure of inequality.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…this variable shows that the variance of the residual is evidence of changing skills prices only when both the variance of unobserved skills and the mvariance of measurement error remain constant over time.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Total Variance of Wages~…written as the variance of the standard log-linear wage equation, where the variance in wages is equal to the variance in the product of observed skills and the return to observed skills and the addition of the variance of the error term.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…the residual variance is the fraction of 1 minus R-squared of the overall variance of wages.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Unobserved Skill Price Changes~…computing the contribution of changes in unobserved skill prices to th growth in wage inequality consist of replacing each period residual by a subsequent period residual at the same position in the residual wage distribution a major advantage of which is that this method can be used to decompose measures of inequality other than the variance.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…data is used on hourly wages from the May and ORG supplements of the Current Population Survey as opposed to the commonly used March supplement of the Current Population Survey because the latter poorly measures the wages of workers paid by the hour.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…used in order to create a sample of men from data in the period from 1973 to 2003.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…used in order to create a sample of men from data in the period from 1973 to 2003.
150~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1973-2003~…the relevant survey period in this research paper from which all Current Population Survey data is drawn.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…can be interpreted as reflecting underlying changes in unobserved skill prices.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…this variable dependends both on the price of unobserved skills and on the variance of unobserved skills.
150~D1, D2, D4~V4~Variable~Price of Unobserved Skills~…an important factor in determining residual variance.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Variance of Unobserved Skills~…an important factor in determining residual variance.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Variance of Unobserved Skills~…the unconditional variance of unobserved skills is dependent on the share of workers in specific experience-education group at a particular time, where changes in the shares will result in changes in the unconditional variance even if the conditional variances are constant over time, unless wages are homoskedastic.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…an increase in the residual variance can be interpreted as an increase in skill prices when the skill composition of the work force is held constant.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…in order to hold the skill composition of the work force constant, residual variance must be recomputed at some counterfactual values of the share of workers in specific experience-education group at a particular time, which remain constant over time.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…when the number of skill groups is small relative to sample sizes, the within-group variance can be computed for each skill group, suggesting it is then straigtfoward to estimate the counterfactual variance by replacing the year-specific shares by some average or base year shares.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Experience-Education Cells~… used in order present some basic trends in residual and within-group inequality by dividing data in a limited number of experience-education cells.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Experience-Education Cells~…working with these coarse cells helps illustrate which factors are driving the overall changes in residual inequality.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…can be decomposed into two terms including a weighted average of changes in the within-group variance and composition effects.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Weighted Average of Changes~…when residual variance is expressed as a weighted average of changes in the within-group variance, this represents the change in the counterfactual variance when the counterfactual weights are set at the base period level.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Composition Effects~…when residual variance is expressed as capturing composition effects, these effects result in a spurious growth in the residual variance when changes in the weights are positively correlated with the within-group variances.
150~D1, D2, D4~M2~Methodology~Logit~…to address the problem that dividing the data into a limited number of coarse experience-education cells may be too restrictive, the reseracher addresses this problem by estimating a flexible logit model to reweight the data in a way that keeps the distribution of skills constant over time.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…the residual variance can be computed directly from the individual level data using the estimated wage residual and sample weights for specific workers at specific times.
150~D1, D2, D4~M2~Methodology~Logit~…can be thought of as the weighted sum of the contribution of each worker to the overall variance.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Wage Sample Weight~…defined as the inverse of the number of observations, however in the Current Population Survey this sample weight differs across observations, reflecting the sampling design of the survey.

150~D1, D2, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Reweighting Factor~…used in order to transform the skill distribution in a certain year back to its 1973 level through putting less weight on more experienced workers, since the share of these workers has increased over time.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Reweighting Factor~…computed using the estimates from a logit model for the probability of being in a specific year relative to the base year.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Weights~…the counterfactual weights for 2003 when 1973 is used as the base year are computed by estimating a logit model on data for years 1973 and 2003 pooled together.
150~D1, D2, D4~M2~Methodology~Logit~…in some cases, this method is used to estimate counterfactual weights for 2003 when 1973 is used as a base yeare are computed by estimating a logit model on data for years 1973 and 2003 pooled together; in these cases the dependent variable is a dummy variable for year 2003, while the explanatory variables are the age and education variables.
150~D1, D2, D4~V1~Variable~Education~…included as an explanatory variable in logit models inorder to compute reweight factors and counterfactual weights.
150~D1, D2, D4~V5~Variable~Age~…included as an explanatory variable in logit models inorder to compute reweight factors and counterfactual weights.
150~D1, D2, D4~V6~Variable~Wage~…following most of the literature, the wage measures I use is the hourly wage rate, a measure advantageous in the sense that this measure is that theories of wage determination typically pertain to the hourly wage rate.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…the Dual Jobs Supplement of the May Current Population Survey for 1973 to 1978 asks questions to all wage and salary workers about wages on the main job held during the survey week.
150~D1~T2~Time Period~1973-1978~…time period in which the Dual jobs Supplement is included in the May Current Population Survey asking questions to all wage and salary workers about wages on the main job held during the survey week.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…for workers paid by the hour, the May Current Population Survey asks workers directly about their hourly rate of pay.
150~D1, D2, D4~V6~Variable~Wage~…explicitly indicated from the May Current Population Survey data for about 60% of the work force.
150~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Computed Hourly Wage I~…for the remaining 40% of the work force for which hourly rate is not directly given, an hourly wage rate is computed by dividing usual weekly earnings by usual weekly earnings by usual weekly hours of work.
150~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Computed Hourly Wage I~…used for all of the May supplements and the 1979 to 1993 ORG supplements of the Current Population Survey.

150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…the hourly wage computational procedure is consistent across the May and 1979 to 1993 ORG supplements of the Current Population Survey, however changes in the 1994 to 2003 ORG supplement survey period.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…the hourly wage computational procedure is consistent across the May and 1979 to 1993 ORG supplements of the Current Population Survey, however changes in the 1994 to 2003 ORG supplement survey period.

150~D2~T4~Time Period~1994-2003~…the survey period in which Current Population Survey ORG supplement respondents that are not paid by the hour can choose the periodocity at which they report earnings.
150~D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Computed Hourly Wage II~…in these hourly wage computations, measured only for ORG supplement responses from 1994 to 2003, the researcher computes the hourly wage rate by dividing earnings by hours over the corresponding time period.
150~D3~D3~Dataset~MORG Current Population Survey~…the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group files combine data for all 12 months of the year; this supplement is advantageous in that it is 3 times as large as the May or March supplements of the Current Population Survey.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…in the 1973 to 1979 May Current Population Survey, wages were not allocated for workers who refused to answer the wage questions, so to be consistent, the researcher keeps only workers with nonallocated wages in the 1979 to 2003 ORG supplment and as a consequence, is forced to drop observations for 1994 and the first eight months of 1995 in which the Current Population Survey did not flag workers with missing wages.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…the researcher follows most of the literature by trimming wages less than $1 and more than $100 in 1979 dollars, by adjusting top-coded earnings by a factor of 1.4, and weight wage observations by hours of work, and limiting the sample to keep workers age 16 to 64 with positive potential experience.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…the researcher follows most of the literature by trimming wages less than $1 and more than $100 in 1979 dollars, by adjusting top-coded earnings by a factor of 1.4, and weight wage observations by hours of work, and limiting the sample to keep workers age 16 to 64 with positive potential experience.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Residual Wage Inequality~…all measures of residual wage inequality are computed from the residuals of regression of log wages on an unrestricted set of dummies for age, years of schooling, and interactions between nine schooling dummies and a quartic in age.
150~D1, D2, D4~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…a regression of log wages on an unrestricted set of dummies for age, years of schooling, and interactions between nine schooling dummies and a quartic in age are used to compute all the measures of residual wage inequality.
150~D1, D2, D4~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…separate regressions are estimated for both men and women in each year.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…the May 1973 to 1978 and March supplements are administered to all rotation groups of the Current Population Survey during these months, whereas, by contrast, only one quarter of respondents are asked the questions from the ORG supplement each month.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…the May 1973 to 1978 and March supplements are administered to all rotation groups of the Current Population Survey during these months, whereas, by contrast, only one quarter of respondents are asked the questions from the ORG supplement each month.
150~D1, D2, D4~V1~Variable~Education~…measured in years of schooling.
150~D1, D2, D4~V1~Variable~Education~…one problem with using schooling as a regressor in wage equations is that schooling is not measrued in a consistent fashion over time in the Current Population Survey, but nonetheless, it is possible to construct a relatively consistent variable for years of schooling completed over the whole sample period.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…prior to 1992, the Current Population Survey asked about the highest grade attended, and whether the highest grade was completed, whereas starting in 1992, the Current Population Survey switched to a question about the highest grade or diploma completed.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…prior to 1992, the Current Population Survey asked about the highest grade attended, and whether the highest grade was completed, whereas starting in 1992, the Current Population Survey switched to a question about the highest grade or diploma completed.

150~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Experience-Education Cells~…the researcher divides workers into 20 skill groups based on five education categories and four experience categories.
150~D1, D2, D4~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…to improve the precision of the estimates, the researcher pools years 1973 to 1975 for the base period, and years 2000 to 2002 for the end period.
150~D1, D2~T7~Time Period~1973-1975~…the base period pooled together in some regressions in order to improve the precision of residual wage inequality estimates.
150~D1, D2~T8~Time Period~2000-2002~…the base period pooled together in some regressions in order to improve the precision of residual wage inequality estimates.
150~D1, D2, D4~V9~Variable~Gender~…a binary variable specificied for each gender specified as the focus of two different regressions.
150~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Within-Group Variance By Experience-Education Cells~…for four of the 20 groups including college graduates with 1 to 10 years, 11 to 20 years and 21 to 30 years of experience and college postgraduates with 1 to 10 years of experience the changes in the within group variance are large and positive with coefficients of 0.064, 0.072, 0.091 and 0.099, respectively, and exceed the overall change in the residual variance at 0.041; however, for the other 16 education-experience groups, there is no systematic pattern of increase in the within-group variance.
150~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Variance Extremes by Experience-Education Cells~…in both 1973 to 1975 and 2000 to 2002, high-school dropouts with one to ten years experience have the lowest variance at around 0.10, while college postgraduates with 31 and more experience have the largest variance, suggesting that composition effects may be quite important, since both experience and education increase over time.
150~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Correlation-Coefficient and Composition Effect by Gender~…the correlation coefficient between the within-group variance in 2000 to 2002 and the change in share is 0.55 for men and 0.68 for women, suggesting a large and positive composition effect term in the regression.
150~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Male Residual Variance by Time Period Weight~…when the 1973 to 1975 shares are used to weight the 1973 to 1975 variances, and the 200 to 2002 shares are used to weight the 2000 to 2002 variances, the weighted averages correspond to the unadjusted residual variances estimating a male residual variance increase by 0.041 between these two time period.
150~D1, D2, D4~D1~Derived Variable~Residual Variance~…when the 1973 to 1975 shares are used to weight the 1973 to 1975 variances, and the 2000 to 2002 shares are used to weight the 2000 to 2002 variances, the weighted averages correspond to the unadjusted residual variances for 1973 to 1975 and 2000 to 2002, respectively.
150~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Early Period Weight Residual for Males~…when shares are held at their 1973 to 1975 level, the change in the residual is just 0.012 between 1973 to 1975 and 2000 to 2002, suggesting that only about a quarter of the 0.041 change in the residual variance is due to the increase in the within-group variances, whereas the remaining change in the residual variance, 0.029, is due to composition effects.
150~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Early Period Weight Residual for Females~…when results are estimated for women only, composition effects account for 0.035 of the 0.047 increase in the residual variance, while only a quarter of the total increase (0.012) is due to the changes in within-group variances, holding the shares constant at their 1973 to 1975 level.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Composition Effects~…the composition effect can be decomposed into three subgroups including changes in the distribution holding experience constant, changes in the distribution of experience holding education constant, and the interaction term of education and experience.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Experience-Education Cells~…education accounts for most of the variation in the growth in the within-group variance across the 20 experience-education groups.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Reweighting Factor~…one advantage of the reweighting approach is that it is easily implemented even when the data cannot be divided into fine experience-education cells.
150~D1, D2, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Reweighting Factor~…one advantage of the reweighting approach is that it can be used to compute counterfactual measures of residual wage dispersion other than the variance.
150~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Residual Variance Growth Across Sample Period~…the residual variance grows by about 0.04 over the whole sample period from 1973 to 2003.
150~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Counterfactual Variance Across Sample Period~…the counterfactual variance in the late 1990s and early 2000s is only about 0.01 higher than in the mid-1970s when the distribution of skills is held constant at its 1973 level.
150~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Residual Variance Across Sample Period and Total Variance By Gender~…over the whole 1973 to 2003 sample period, the residual component of the variance accounts for less than half of the growth in the total variance at 43% for men and 46% for women, a finding that is at odds with several previous studies that tend to find that most of the growth in wage inequality is due to the residual component.
150~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Experience and Education Distribution at 1973 Level~…when the distribution of experience and education is held at its 1973 level, the remaining growth in the residual variance accounts for only 14% of the 1973 to 2003 growth in the total variance of wages for men, and 5% for women.
150~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Experience and Education Distribution at 2003 Level~…when the distribution of experience and education is held at its 2003 level, the remaining growth in the residual variance accounts for 23% of the 1973 to 2003 growth in the total variance of wages for men, and 31% for women.
150~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Late Period Weight Residual Variance for Males~…the residual variance for men increases by 0.034 between 1979 and 1989 when the distribution of skills is held at its 2003 level, a change that is larger than the 0.024 change over the whole period, suggesting that for the other sample periods, i.e. 1973 to 1979 and 1989 to 2003, pooled together, the residual variance declined by 0.009.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…a problematic dataset in computing the residual variance and wage inequality as it poorly measures hourly wages.

150~D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Total Annual Hours~…computed for March Current Population Survey respondents by multiplying two variables including weekly hours of work last year and weeks worked last year.
150~D1, D2, D4~V10~Variable~Weekly Hours~…used, in part, for March Current Population Survey respondents to compute the total annual hours worked.
150~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Weeks Worked~…used for March Current Population Survey respondents in order to calculate the total annual hours worked.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…in the pre-1976 March Current Population Survey, respondents were only asked about their full-time/part-time status last year, instead of usual hours of work per year.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…in the pre-1976 March Current Population Survey, weeks worked last year was limited to few intervals including 0, 1 to 13, 14 to 26, 27 to 39, 40 to 47, 48 to 49, and 50 to 52.
150~D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Computed Hourly Wage III~…limited to the subset of the workforce that works full time.
150~D4~T9~Time Period~1975-2002~…for all analysis using the March Current Population Survey, the researcher limits data to the period starting with earnings year 1975, or the March 1976 survey.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…for all analysis using the March Current Population Survey, the researcher limits data to the period starting with earnings year 1975, or the March 1976 survey because there exists almost 30 years of data for which hourly wage rates can be directly computed for all workers and because the other wage measure available only in the May/ORG Current Population Survey from May 1973 on making for better comparison of the two data sources..
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…asks wage questions only to wage and salary workers.

150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…analysis of this data is limited to wage and salary earnings, however to limit the impact of lack of knowledge as to whether workers have both wage and salary and self-employment earnings, the researcher further limits analysis to wage and slary workers with very limited self-employment earnings, i.e. less than 10% of wage and salary earnings.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…only 5% of workers hold more than one job at the same time, limiting issues that may exist due to the fact that this data only asks questions about the respondents main job.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…only 5% of workers hold more than one job at the same time, limiting issues that may exist due to the fact that this data asks questions about all jobs worked by respondents.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…because this data comes from a point-in-time survey, the probability that an individual's wage is collected depneds on the number of weeks worked during a year.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…because this data comes from a point-in-time survey, the probability that an individual's wage is collected depneds on the number of weeks worked during a year.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…in this dataset, a wage rate can calculated irrespective of the amount of weeks worked during the year, provided that this number does not equal zero.

150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~"…in this supplement of the Current Population Survey, a growing faction of workers do not answer questions about wages and earnings, through which the Census Bureau allocates a wage or earnings item for these workers using the ""hot deck"" procedure while also providing flags and related sources of information that can be used to identify workers with allocated wages in all years except in the January 1994 to August ORG Supplements."
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~"…in this supplement of the Current Population Survey, a growing faction of workers do not answer questions about wages and earnings, through which the Census Bureau allocates a wage or earnings item for these workers using the ""hot deck"" procedure while also providing flags and related sources of information that can be used to identify workers with allocated wages in all years."
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…in the 1973 to 1978 survey years of this supplement, wages were not allocated for workers who fsailed to answer wage and earnings questions.
150~D1~T2~Time Period~1973-1978~…time period in which the May Current Population Survey did not allocate wages for workers who failed to answer wage and earnings questions.
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…throughout the sample period, the hourly wage is topcoded remains constant at $99.99 and only a handful of hourly workers have their wage censored at this value, however a substantial number of nonhourly workers in this dataset do have topcoded hourly wages.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…throughout the sample period, the hourly wage is topcoded remains constant at $99.99 and only a handful of hourly workers have their wage censored at this value, however a substantial number of nonhourly workers in this dataset do have topcoded hourly wages.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…throughout the sample period, the hourly wage is topcoded varies, however a problem is consistent for this data in that a substantial number of workers in the March supplement have topcoded wages..
150~D1~D1~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…in the first sample years from 1975 to 1980, the weekly topcode in this supplement was $999.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…in the first sample years from 1975 to 1980, the weekly topcode in this supplement was $999, while in the last sample years from 1998 to 2003, the weekly topcode in this supplement is $2,884, which is identical to the implied weekly topcode for full-year workers in the March Current Population Survey.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…in the first sample years from 1975 to 1980, the computed weekly topcode for full year workers in the March Current Population Survey was $962 for full-year workers ($50,000 annual topcode divided by 52), while in the last sample years from 1998 to 2003, the weekly topcode is $2,884 ($150,000 annual topcode divided by 52).
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…allocation flags are incorrect in the 1989 to 1993 ORG supplement and fail to identify most workers with missing wges.

150~D5~D5~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics~…reports both edited and unedited measures of wages and earnings, information that is valuable to identify workers with allocated wages in the 1989 to 1993 ORG supplement samples.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…prior to March 1996, the earnings variable of workers who are topcoded simply takes the value of the actual topcode, whereas starting in March 1996, however, the value of earnings for topcoded workers is replaced by the mean earnings among all topcoded workers.

150~D1, D2, D4~F13~Findings~Measurement Error in March Current Population Survey vs. May/ORG Supplements~…the extent of measurement error in the March Current Population Survey for workers paid by the hour is both quantitatively and statistically significant, with an average difference in variance for men of 0.064, which represents about a third of the average variance in the May/ORG Current Population Surveys at 0.198, and the difference for women is 0.055, also representing a third of the average variance of wages in the May/ORG Current Population Surveys at 0.167.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…wages are more noisily measured in the March Current Population Survey than the May/ORG Supplements of the Current Population Survey suggesting that residual wage inequality is biased up in the March Current Population Survey because this wage measure poorly captures the hourly wage rate for workers paid by the hour.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…measurement problems do not affect between-group wage dispersion but spuriously inflate residual wage dispersion in the March Current Population Survey, suggesting that residual wage inequality is biased up in the March Current Population Survey because this wage measure poorly captures the hourly wage rate for workers paid by the hour.
150~D1, D2, D4~F14~Findings~Fraction of Hourly Workers Change by Education Group~…for men and women, the fraction of workers paid by the hour has increased by up to 15 to 20 percentage points, depending on the education group, between the mid-1970s and the late 1980s.
150~D1, D2, D4~V6~Variable~Wage~…the fraction of workers that report being paid by the hour declines as a function of experience.
150~D1, D2, D4~F15~Findings~Variance in Wages for Hourly Workers Across Datasets~…for hourly-rated workers, the variance of wages in the March Current Population Survey exceeds the variance in the May/ORG Current Population Survey by 0.05 to 0.07, providing an estimate of the variance componenent due to the fact that wages are moor poorly measured in the March supplement than in the May/ORG Current Population Surveys.
150~D4~F16~Findings~Spurious Growth in March Supplement~…combining the resulting spurious variance component with the 10 to 15 percentage point growth in the fraction of workers paid by the hour yields a spurious growth of up to 0.01 in the variance of March supplement wages.
150~D1, D2, D4~F17~Findings~Measurement Error for Hourly Workers Across Datasets~…measurement error variance for hourly workers represents around 33% of the total variance of wages in the March CPS compared to only about 10% of the total variance of wages in the May/ORG Current Population Survey.
150~D1, D2, D4~F18~Findings~Measurement Error for Nonhourly Workers Across Datsets~…measurement error accounts for about 20% of the variance of wages for nonhourly workers in the March and May/ORG Current Population Surveys.
150~D1, D2, D4~F19~Findings~Variance of Measurement Error by Gender~…for men, the variance of measurement error increased by 0.018 in the March Current Population Survey compared to 0.004 in the May/ORG Current Population Survey, while for women, the corresponding measurement error variances grew by 0.014 and 0.013, respectively.
150~D1, D2, D4~F20~Findings~R-Squared of Results w/ Early Period constraint~…when comparing the residual variance when characteristics are held constant at their 1973 level to the predicted variance from a regression that includes a linear trend and the log real minimum wage as regressors, the R-squared is 0.81 and 0.88 for men and women, respectively.
150~D4~D4~Dataset~March Current Population Survey~…this data does not provide very accurate measures of wages for the majority of workers who are paid by the hour.
150~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…this data provides more accurate measures of hourly wages relative to the March Current Population Survey for a much larger sample of workers.

150~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Weights~…puts much more weight on less educated workers and less weight on more educated workers resulting in large composition effects in the MAY/ORG Current Population Surveys because the within-group variance among highly educated workers is much larger than among less educated workers.
150~D1, D2, D4~F21~Findings~Within-Group Variance by Education Level~…in the early 2000s, between 80% and 90% of high-school dropouts were paid by the hour compared to just more than 10% among college postgraduates, a difference of about 70 percentage points, suggesting that the within-group variance of high-school dropouts in the March Current Population Survey is inflated by about 0.05 relative to college postgraduates representing about a third of the 0.15 to 0.20 difference in the within-group variance between college postgraduates and high-school dropouts during the same period.

151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…a simple example makes clear how the consumption model works. Suppose a worker gets laid off from his job; he does not know immediately whether this is due to specific conditions at his firm or because of the onset of a general recession. If the layoff is due to highly individual factors then it will be easy for the worker to find new employment and the income reduction associated with the employment spell does not call for a major revision in consumption expenditures. Should the unemployment be due to aggregate factors, employment will be depressed at other firms as well and lead to a much longer expected unemployment spell. The necessary revision in consumption will be much larger than in the former case. The worker adjusts consumption in a way that will be correct on average given his overall experience with unemployment.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…looking at aggregate data, an econometrician will find ex post that everybody revised consumption downward too little at the onset of a recession. Subsequently, there will be further revisions once workers learn about the true scope and persistence of the shock. Consumption will appear correlated with lagged income and will appear smoother than predicted by a model where agents know the cause and length of their unemployment spell immediately.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in this paper, the author examines Goodfriend's model with lagged information on aggregate income as well as a version where agents know only their own income processes but never observe the aggregate component in their income. To avoid convoluting information aggregation with other issues, the author uses Flavin's (1981) model with quadratic instantaneous utility as a tool for this analysis. This allows explicit solutions for the consumption process.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…in this paper, the author examines Goodfriend's model with lagged information on aggregate income as well as a version where agents know only their own income processes but never observe the aggregate component in their income.

This allows explicit solutions for the consumption process.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…given the joint behavior of income and consumption it is possible to calculate the regression coefficient of consumption changes on lagged income changes and the ratio of the variability in consumption to the variability in the income innovation. These predictions are easily compared to the sample statistics for aggregate data.

These predictions are easily compared to the sample statistics for aggregate data.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to calibrate the model it is necessary to have information on aggregate and individual income processes. The author uses the 1984 Panel of the Survey of income and Program Participation which contains monthly information on family income to construct the appropriate quarterly micro data. Alternative estimates are presented using the monthly data directly allowing for the adjustment for measurement error using various forms of respondent behavior.

151~D1~T1~Time Period~1984.0~…panel from which Survey of Income and Program Participation data is drawn.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…agents have individual specific income processes that differ from the time series structure of aggregate income. However, each micro agent has full contemporaneous information on aggregate income. At the aggregate level, this model is equivalent to a representative agent model.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…agents have individual specific income processes that differ from the time series structure of aggregate income. However, each micro agent has full contemporaneous information on aggregate income. At the aggregate level, this model is equivalent to a representative agent model.
151~D1, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Utility~…the infinitely lived consumer solves a standard life-cycle maximization problem with intertemporally separable utility. The instantaneous utility function is quadric.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…every period, non-interest income is paid.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…every period, consumption takes place before interest accrues on wealth.
151~D1, D3~V2~Variable~Interest Rate~…consumers can borrow and lend freely at a constant interest rate which is equal to the discount rate.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…if income follows a linear univariate time series process known to the consumer, then the changes in consumption can be expressed in terms of the innovations to the income process.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…let income be a process that is stationary in first differences so that it has a Wold representation.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…the current research considers models where all individuals have identical income processes while each agent faces different realizations of this process.
151~D1, D3~DV11~Variable~Income Process~…consider a simple example where income consists of a random walk with innovations that are common to all individuals and a white noise component with shocks that are uncorrelated across individuals. In first differences this process is equal to the aggregate income innovation plus the individual income shock subtracted by the individual income shock in the previous period. The innovations are assumed to be uncorrelated.
151~D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Income Innovation~…the aggregate income innovation is used in computing first-difference changes in non-interest income.
151~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Individual Income Shock~…the individual income shock is used in computing first-difference changes in non-interest income.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…every period agents observe their own personal level of income.
151~D3~V3~Variable~Aggregate Income~…every period agents observe aggregate income.
151~D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Income Innovation~…because, every period, agents observe their own income as well as aggregate income, and given that they also know the complete history of these variables, they can infer the fundamental shocks to income.
151~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Individual Income Shock~…because, every period, agents observe their own income as well as aggregate income, and given that they also know the complete history of these variables, they can infer the fundamental shocks to income.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…the optimal rule is to adjust consumption fully to the permanent (aggregate) shock and by the annuity value to the transitory (individual) shock.
151~D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Aggregate Income Innovation~…the change in average per capita consumption is found by summing over individuals.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…aggregate consumption is a random walk.
151~D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Income Innovation~…the consumption change is just the aggregate income innovation. Hence this model yields the same predictions as a representative agent model where the representative agent faces the aggregate income process. In particular, consumption changes are uncorrelated with lagged aggregate variables, like lagged consumption or income changes.
151~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Standard Deviations ~…the ratio of the standard deviation of consumption changes to the standard deviation of income innovations.
151~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Standard Deviations ~…this ratio should equal the consumption response predicted by the model, one in this case.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…consider the income process but now assume that individuals can only observe their individual income. If the individual cannot distinguish the aggregate and the individual component, then this process to her looks just like an MA(1) process for the first differences in income. The income process the individual observes can be computed by a random variable containing information on current and lagged aggregate and individual income innovation subtracted by a variance parameter of the aggregate and individual income shocks multiplied on the random variable containing information on current and lagged aggregate and individual income innovation in the previous period.
151~D1, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Innovation Information~…a random variable containing information on current and lagged aggregate and individual income innovations.
151~D1, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Innovation Information~…note that this variable, though not a fundamental driving process of the model, is an innovation sequence with respect to the history of individual income changes.
151~D1, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Theta~…the MA parameter theta, used in calculating the income process individuals observe without distinguishing aggregate and the individual component of the income process, depends on the relative variances of the aggregate and individual income shocks.
151~D1, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Individual Consumption Changes~…individual consumption changes are a martingale with respect to the history of individual consumption and income. The martingale property only holds with respect to variables that are in individual's information sets.
151~D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Income Innovation~…to find the change in average per capita consumption use the change in consumption equality and the first differences in income equation and sum over individuals.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…unlike individual consumption, the per capita series of consumption is not a random walk as the first representative agent model predicts. Consumption, in this case, now follows an AR(1) in first differences. The intution for this is rather simple. Suppose a positive aggregate shock hits the economy. All the individual consumers see their income increasing but they assume that part of the shock is idiosyncratic and therefore transitory. The will raise their consumption but not by as much as the permanence of the shock calls for. Because the shock is persistent, in the following period they will be surprised again that their income is higher than expected. Hence, they will increase their consumption further, and so on.
151~D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Income Innovation~…because individuals do not recognize an aggregate shock to be permanent they will not adjust their consumption by as much as they would if it were the only type of shock to occur. This will lead to more smoothness in aggregate data than predicted by the full information model where the variance of consumption changes equals the variance of aggregate income innovations.
151~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Standard Deviations ~…if idiosyncratic shocks are present and the interest rate is small enough the ratio of the standard deviations of the change in consumption and the aggregate income innovation will always be less than one.
151~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Lagged Income Process~…suppose aggregate data are published with a one period lag. In period t an individual will observe an individual-level income and the aggregate shock. Also assume again that the consumer has access to the infinite history of shocks and can therefore infer the individual income shock in the previous period as well once the aggregate shock is known.
151~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Lagged Income Process~…the lagged income process for the individual is computed by subtracting the previous period individual income innovation from the current period innovation which is contained in current individual income.
151~D1, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Current Period Innovation~...the current period innovation is contained in current individual income. The consumer does not know how the innovation in a particular period is composed of the permanent (aggregate) component and the transitory (individual) component. She will therefore attribute part of the current period innovation to each component given the relative variances. For every particular innovation there will be errors.
151~D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Lagged Aggregate Shock~…the consumer gets information from the lagged aggregate shock. Once this information arrives shewill be able to correct the error made last period in attributing the innovation to its components.
151~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Consumption Response~…the optimal consumption response will have two parts corresponding to the two pieces of information used in computing the lagged income process: a response to the new innovation and a term that corrects for the error made in the previous period.
151~DV14~L1~Variable Value~Response to New Innovation~…the consumption response reaction to the current period innovation.
151~DV14~L2~Variable Value~Response to Error Correction~…a term that corrects for the error made in the previous period.
151~DV14~L1~Variable Value~Response to New Innovation~…the first term is the proportion of the new innovation expected to be permanent; the consumption response to that part is one. The second term is the part expected to be transitory; the response is r/(1+r) where r is the interest rate.
151~D3~DV15~Derived Variable~Relative Variance of the Aggregate Shock~…the relative variance of the aggregate shock as used in computing the consumption response to new innovations.
151~DV14~L2~Variable Value~Response to Error Correction~…the errors in the individual component and in the aggregate component have to sum to zero since the signal extraction problem the individual solved in the previous period yielded unbiased predictors of the two components.
151~DV14~L2~Variable Value~Response to Error Correction~…the response of consumption in period t to errors made in t - 1 is contingent on the correction of the error in the aggregate, and the correction for the error in the individual component. Notice that interest accrued on the portions of the shocks that had not been consumed in the last period.
151~D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Correction of the Aggregate Error~…the first term in the square bracket in computing the consumption response to error correction is the correction of the error in the aggregate component.
151~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Correction of the Individual Error~…the second term in computing the consumption response to error correction is the correction for the error in the individual component.
151~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Consumption Response~…individual consumption changes follow a martingale with respect to the history of individual income and consumption.
151~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Per Capita Consumption Response~…sum the individual consumption responses for a large population to get the per capita consumption response.
151~D1, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Current Period Innovation~…this variable in the lagged information model only contains information on contemporaneous aggregate and individual shocks.
151~D1, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Innovation Information~…in the no information model, this variable contains new information on lagged shock.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…income consists of an aggregate and an individual componenent given by their respective Wold representations.
151~D3~V3~Variable~Aggregate Income~…income consists of an aggregate and an individual componenent given by their respective Wold representations.
151~D1, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Average Per Capita Income~…the average per capita income given within an economy.
151~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Individual Income Shock~…given stationarity, the process for individual income changes has a Wold representation.
151~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Normalized Spectral Density~…the normalized spectral density at a certain frequency for a specific process as used as a sufficient condition for excess smoothness.
151~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Normalized Spectral Density~…the higher is the spectral density at frequency zero of aggregate income compared to the compound process (and thus compared to individual income) the more likely is the model to yield excess smoothness.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…excess volatility of consumption can arise even if aggregate shocks are more permanent if certain spectral densities are not well represented in individual income.
151~D1, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Current Period Innovation~…defined as the contemporaneous innovation.
151~D1, D3~DV21~Derived Variable~Previous Period Error~…since all previous values of the aggregate shocks can be observed and all the previous values of the individual shocks can be inferred, researchers can again think of information consisting of the innovation and the correction for the error made before. The error made last period is defined in attributing parts of the innovation to the aggregate and the individual processes..
151~D1, D2, D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Regression Coefficient of Consumption Changes on Lagged Income Changes~…the regression coefficient of consumption changes on lagged income changes.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…this paper explores whether the data bear out the implications of the incomplete information models studied. The strategy pursued is to estimate simple models for the miro and macro income processes first. Using these estimates, the author calculates the implied values of the excess smoothness ratio and the regression coefficient for the orthogonality test at the aggregate level.

151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…in order to have analogous results for individual income, the author estimated models for monthly and quarterly data that were constructed from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…this panel survey was conducted three times a year from late 1983 to the beginning of 1986 in about 20,000 households and collected monthly income information. In each interview, separate information was collected on each of the past four months. The SIPP uses a rotation group design, where one fourth of the sample is interviewed in every calendar month.
151~D1~T2~Time Period~1983-1986~…the Survey of Income and Program Participation was conducted three times a year from late 1983 to the beginning of 1986.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…two alternative approaches are taken to estimate income processes from the data, using the data in two different ways. The first is to construct a panel of quarterly income from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the first quarter of 1986, the longest span for which information on the entire sample is available. These data are used to estimate parsimonious but otherwise unrestricted income processes. Unfortunately, much of the measured variance and dynamics in these data may be due to measurement error. To account at least for some of the error, the author also estimates a simple structural income process for the monthly data jointly with a model of misreporting behavior. Under certain assumptions, one can identify some of the response error. The implied quarterly income process net of measurement error is then derived by time aggregating the results.
151~D1, D3~DV28~Derived Variable~Income Process~…the first method of estimating income processes is to construct a panel of quarterly income from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the first quarter of 1986, the longest span for which information on the entire sample is available. These data are used to estimate parsimonious but otherwise unrestricted income processes.
151~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Simple Structural Income Process~…to account for at least some of the measurement error, the author estimates a simple structural income process for the monthly data jointly with a model of misreporting behavior. Under certain assumptions, the researcher can identify some of the response error.
151~D1~DV30~Derived Variable~Implied Quarterly Income Process~…to account for at least some of the measurement error, the author estimates a simple structural income process for the monthly data jointly with a model of misreporting behavior. Under certain assumptions, the researcher can identify some of the response error. the implied quarterly income process net of measurement error is then derived by time aggregating the results.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…families were selected that can be followed continuously throughout the sample period and did not change head or spouse. The sample selection will tend to understate the variance of income changes. Furthermore, the sample was limited to households whose head did not go to school in any part of the sample period. Nonfamily households were eliminated as well since the author can not judge whether they make joint or individual consumption decisions. finally, the sample was limited to families with heads between the ages of 16 and 70.
151~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Age~…the sample is limited to families with heads between the ages of 16 and 70 during the survey period.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…variables on total family income and income from capital are provided on the SIPP user tapes; these are aggregated from an array of detailed questions on various income categories for each family member.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…the correct income concept is net family income from all sources excluding capital income.
151~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Years of Schooling~…a characteristic variable of interest used in the analysis portion of this research.
151~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Non-White~…a characteristic variable of interest used in the analysis portion of this research.

151~D1, D2~V11~Variable~1984 (quarterly amounts)~…a characteristic variable of interest used in the analysis portion of this research.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…the author uses the aggregate family level variables, although there are some problems associated with them. First, tax information is only collected annually and cannot be apportioned to single months. Therefore, gross income must be used, which will have ahigher variance and (in a progressive tax system) exhibit more transitory fluctuations than net income. Furthermore, the individual variables that make up family income can have imputations. Since the imputations occur at the disaggregated level it would be rather arbitrary to decide which observations to delete because of the imputation. The author decides to use all the data. Imputations raise the variance of income changes, presumably largely at the cost of the transitory income component. Finally, all disaggregated income items are topcoded at $8,333 per month. It is impossible to decide from the aggregated income items which variables have been topcoded. Therefore, all observations subject to topcoding are kept in the sample at the topcoded amounts. The topcoding should only affect a small portion of the sample and will reduce the estimated income variance.

151~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the author provided some basic characteristics of the sample which also presents results from the March 1985 Current Population Survey (CPS).
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…about 2% of the households in each wave report total income of $8,333 or more. This is an upper bound for the incidence of topcoding since it may result by summing various components that may each be below the cutoff. 
151~D1~M2~Methodology~Monte Carlo~...to gauge the influence of topcoding on the later estimates the author conducted a small Monte Carlo study with a log-normal distribution of the level of initial income and an income process consisting of a random walk plus white noise. The innovations were drawn from a normal distribution with individual specific variances that were distributed chi-square. Variances were chosen to mimic the incidence of top coding in the sample. In all cases examined, the variance of income changes and the first autocovariance were underestimated to the same degree thus reflecting income dynamics correctly. The degree to which estimated variances were too low depended on specific parameter values but was typically moderate.
151~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Measured Quarterly Income~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, the researcher begins by deflating monthly income by the consumer price index for urban consumers (base 1982-84) and aggregating measured family income into calendar quarterly amounts. The estimation of the quarterly income process proceeds in three further stages.
151~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Measured Quarterly Income~…FIRST STAGE: in a first step, the author regressed changes in family income on a constant, changes in total family size, changes in the number of childre, and age of the head to eliminate deterministic components of income dynamics; these regressors are similar to the ones used by Hall and Mishkin (1982). Separate regressions were run for each quarter. Thus the data will be purged of all common seasonal and aggregate components as well.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~...in a first step in computing measured quarterly income, the author regressed changes in family income on a constant, changes in total family size, changes in the number of children, and age of the head to eliminate deterministic components of income dynamics; these regressors are similar to the ones used by Hall and Mishkin (1982). Separate regressions were run for each quarter. Thus the data will be purged of all common seasonal and aggregate components as well. Additional lagged labor market indicators, like number of earners in the household, weeks worked by the head, weekly hours, occupation, and industry as additional regressors, are included.
151~D1, D2~F2~Findings~R-Squares of Measured Quarterly Income Regressions~…none of the initial measured quarterly income regressions explains income changes very well; as is usual in such regressions the R-squares range from only 0.002 to 0.008! Adding lagged labor market indicators, like number of earners in the household, weeks worked by the head, weekly hours, occupation, and industry as additional regressors hardly changes the results.
151~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Individual Income Shock~…individual changes in family income are included as the dependent variable in regressions used to compute measured quarterly income.
151~D1, D2~V12~Variable~Total Family Size Changes~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on changes in total family size to eliminate deterministic components of income dynamics.
151~D1, D2~V13~Variable~Number of Children Changes~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on changes in the number of children to eliminate deterministic components of income dynamics.
151~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Age~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on the age of the head to eliminate deterministic components of income dynamics.
151~D1, D2~V14~Variable~Number of Earners~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on the number of earners in the household as a labor market indicator.
151~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Weeks Worked by Head~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on the weeks worked by the head as a labor market indicator.
151~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Weekly Hours~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on the weekly hours worked by the head as a labor market indicator.
151~D1, D2~V17~Variable~Occupation~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on the occupation of the head as a labor market indicator.
151~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Industry~…in computing measured quarterly net family income, changes in family income are regressed on the industry of the head as a labor market indicator.
151~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Measured Quarterly Income~…SECOND STAGE: the second step was to estimate the unrestricted covariance matrix of residual income changes as displayed in a 9 X 9 matrix.
151~D1~F3~Findings~Standard Deviations of Quarterly Family Incomes~…the standard deviations of quarterly family income changes range from $2,796 to $3,192. The mean level of family income is $6,929. The standard deviations are between 40% and 46% of the income level.
151~D1, D3~DV24~Derived Variable~Residual Income Changes~…a 9 X 9 unrestricted covariance matrix of residual income changes. 
151~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Measured Quarterly Income~…THIRD STATE: the third step presents stationary processes for income changes as minimum distance estimates restricting the diagonals of the covaiance matrix to have constant elements.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~"…the main measurement problem in the SIPP seems to be related to the timing of changes. As a referee pointed out, the family income in the SIPP has the feature that it is constant over a period of time and only changes at infrequent intervals. This constancy of income in the SIPP is mainly a feature of the interview structure. Recall that information is collected retrospectively by asking respondents separately about each of the past four months. This pattern is typically referred to as ""seam bias"" and is observed for most variables in the SIPP."
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…the family income in the SIPP has the feature that it is constant over a period of time and only changes at infrequent intervals. This constancy of income in the SIPP is mainly a feature of the interview structure. Recall that information is collected retrospectively by asking respondents separately about each of the past four months.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…47% of the families in the sample report no change in income from one month to the next if the information was collected in the same interview. Only 9% report constant income in two adjacent months if these reports come from different interviews. A large fraction, 27%, of respondents report constant income within the entire interview.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…there seems to be some consensus that most respondents of the SIPP tend to report roughly correct transitions (into and out of program participation of income recipiency, and of amounts) but fail to identify the exact timing of transitions or changes. Changes durin the four months of an interview seem to be underreported while too many changes are reported at the seams between interviews.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the model will allow for four possible types of respondent behavior and let the data decide which of these is important. In order to do this, the researcher will have to model income processes and respondent behavior directly at the monthly level.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…the model will allow for four possible types of respondent behavior and let the data decide which of these is important.

151~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Household Behavior~…the model will allow for four possible types of respondent behavior and let the data decide which of these is important. In order to do this, the researcher will have to model income processes and respondent behavior directly at the monthly level.
151~D1, D3~DV25~Derived Variable~True Monthly Income~…assume that true monthly income consists of a random walk component plus a white noise component contingent on the interview dat and the month of the interview.
151~D1~V19~Variable~Month of Interview~…if the interview was in May and refers to January through April, then t will be 1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth.
151~D1~V19~Variable~Month of Interview~…in differences, t = 1 will involve an across seam change.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…reported income for every household has a classical, additive measurement error which is constant for the four months of an interview and serially uncorrelated across interviews.
151~D1, D2, D3~DV31~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~…reported income for every household has a classical, additive measurement error which is constant for the four months of an interview and serially uncorrelated across interviews.
151~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Household Behavior~…the author distinguishes between four types of houeshold behavior.
151~DV32~L3~Variable Value~Truthful Reporting of Income~…this household behavior constitutes respondents reporting their income correctly except for the classical measurement error.
151~DV32~L4~Variable Value~Telescoping of All Income~…this household behavior constitutes respondents reporting the income received in the final month for all months of the interview. Notice that this pattern of behavior still lets researchers observe all permanent changes in income while eliminating all information on transitory receipts during the first three months of the interview.
151~DV32~L5~Variable Value~Telescoping of Permanent Income~…respondents report changes in permanent income only at the seam while they still report transitory income in the month it was actually received.
151~DV32~L6~Variable Value~Heaping of Transitory Income~…heaping of transitory income on the last month is the analogue to the telescoping of permanent income pattern. Respondents report all permanent changes correctly but move all transitory income received during the interview to the last month.
151~D1~DV33~Derived Variable~Proportion Telescoping All Income~…a fraction of the sample households behave according to the telescoping of all income pattern.
151~D1~DV34~Derived Variable~Proportion Telescoping Permanent Income~…a fraction of the sample households behave according to the telescoping of permanent income pattern.
151~D1~DV35~Derived Variable~Proportion Heaping Transitory Income~…a fraction of the sample households behave according to the heaping of transitory income pattern.
151~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Household Behavior~…obviously, these behavioral patterns are rather stylized, but they convey the flavor of research findings on response behavior in retrospective panels.
151~DV32~L3~Variable Value~Truthful Reporting of Income~…the possibility of accurate reports is captured in the first pattern. The additive measurement error for this group is not restrictive. If some households do not make this error, then this will be reflected in a nuisance parameter, but will not influence the autocovariance structure. The parameters for the income process will therefore be estimated correctly.
151~DV32~L4~Variable Value~Telescoping of All Income~…the telescoping found by Goudreau, Oberheu, and Vaughan (1984) is reflected in the second pattern of behavior. Since life-cycle households ought to be concerned with distinguishing between permanent and temporary income changes, misreporting may also differ along this dimension.
151~DV32~L5~Variable Value~Telescoping of Permanent Income~…since life-cycle households ought to be concerned with distinguishing between permanent and temporary income changes, misreporting may also differ along the telescoping of all income dimension. This is captured in this pattern of behavior.
151~DV32~L6~Variable Value~Heaping of Transitory Income~…since life-cycle households ought to be concerned with distinguishing between permanent and temporary income changes, misreporting may also differ along the telescoping of all income dimension. This is captured in this pattern of behavior.
151~D1~DV33~Derived Variable~Proportion Telescoping All Income~…in the estimation, the fractions of household behaving according to each pattern are restricted to one. This restriction is useful in making the variance parameters directly interpretable. It does not necessarily imply that it cannot be the same respondents who, for example, telescope permanent income and heap transitory income.
151~D1~DV34~Derived Variable~Proportion Telescoping Permanent Income~…in the estimation, the fractions of household behaving according to each pattern are restricted to one. This restriction is useful in making the variance parameters directly interpretable. It does not necessarily imply that it cannot be the same respondents who, for example, telescope permanent income and heap transitory income.
151~D1~DV35~Derived Variable~Proportion Heaping Transitory Income~…in the estimation, the fractions of household behaving according to each pattern are restricted to one. This restriction is useful in making the variance parameters directly interpretable. It does not necessarily imply that it cannot be the same respondents who, for example, telescope permanent income and heap transitory income.
151~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Household Behavior~…which households are involved in what type of behavior is irrelevant (and not identified from covariances alone) as long as some households behave according to the model.
151~DV32~L5~Variable Value~Telescoping of Permanent Income~…note that the specification implies that telescoping of permanent and heaping of transitory income together is not the same as telescoping of all income.
151~DV32~L6~Variable Value~Heaping of Transitory Income~…note that the specification implies that telescoping of permanent and heaping of transitory income together is not the same as telescoping of all income.
151~DV32~L4~Variable Value~Telescoping of All Income~…note that the specification implies that telescoping of permanent and heaping of transitory income together is not the same as telescoping of all income.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…all four types of behavior together are not identified from the data and the author will therefore only present selected combinations (i.e. set certain values of the proportion of households exhibiting a certain behavior to zero).
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to estimate models of household behavior, the data have to be arranged differently from the estimates for quarterly income dynamics. Since the measurement errors occur in the reported income amounts it is not possible to deflate income or make any prior adjustments for demographics. The latter will make little differene since these first stage regressions had very low R-squares anyway. Secondly, the data have to be arranged according to the timing of SIPP interviews rather than according to calendar time.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…to estimate models of household behavior, the data have to be arranged differently from the estimates for quarterly income dynamics.

151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…in estimating models of household behavior, the data have to be arranged according to the timing of SIPP interviews rather than according to calendar time. Recall that the SIPP has a rotation group design with each rotation group being interviewed in a different calendar month. In pooling the data across rotation groups according to the timing of SIPP interviews, the author ignores calendar time effects (like seasonality). The author uses only waves one to eight in the estimation because only two rotation groups were interviewed for nine waves.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the standard errors were obtained from 500 bootstrap replications.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…the standard errors were obtained from 500 bootstrap replications.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…two sets of estimations are presented. The first set is for monthly income changes. To reduce the size of the estimation problem, the dat is pooled by treating each household-wave as a separate observation. Separate values for the variance and for the first four autocovariances are estimated depending on the interview month t the data come from (since the model implies different values for these moments depending on time in the interview). All higher order autocovariances are zero in these model and are not considered. The data is stacked in such a way that samples of the same size are used in the estimation of all the moments. The corresponding fourth moments are also estimated.

151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…two sets of estimations are presented. The second set of estimates is obtained from income differences four months apart. In this case, the differences will be formed by subtracting income from the same interview month in the last interview. The corresponding behavioral models should yield the same estimates as from the one month differenced data if the models are specified correctly. Thus, these additional results yield an added check on the validity of the models presented. In the case of the four month differences, the data are pooled in a slightly different way. This is necessary because the model involves nonzero covariances up to lag seven for the four months differenced representation.

151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…presents estimates of the underlying variance and share parameters using various combinations of the four types of behavioral response error.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…presents estimates of the underlying variance and share parameters using various combinations of the four types of behavioral response error.
151~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Household Behavior~…these were obtained from the variances and autocovariances by optimal minimum distance.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…standard asymptotic distribution theory does not apply in the case where a parameter is estimated to be on the boundary of the parameter space.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…standard asymptotic distribution theory does not apply in the case where a parameter is estimated to be on the boundary of the parameter space.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the paramters on the boundary were estimated to be zero in all the replications. This probably is a reflection of the large number of observations and might indicate that the models are not specified quite correctly.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…the paramters on the boundary were estimated to be zero in all the replications. This probably is a reflection of the large number of observations and might indicate that the models are not specified quite correctly.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the behavior model estimates are not fully efficient because the stacking of various waves of the panel introduces some serial dependence across observations and this is not taken into account in calculating the weighting matrix. But with the large sample size, estimates are relatively insentive to the particular weighting matrix chosen: unweighted estimates were very similar. Test statistics will be affected by using a nonoptimal weighting matrix, however.

Test statistics will be affected by using a nonoptimal weighting matrix, however.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…resamples of entire income records for a household were drawn from the set of households before stacking various waves since only these individual records are independent. The sampling variances were computed from the resamples.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…resamples of entire income records for a household were drawn from the set of households before stacking various waves since only these individual records are independent. The sampling variances were computed from the resamples.
151~D1~F4~Findings~Telescoping of Permanent Income and Monthly Differences~…telescoping of permanent income is found to be important for the estimates from one month differences, with the proportion of individuals doing so estimated to be equal to 0.64, while this behavior is estimated to be absent for the four month differences.
151~D1~DV30~Derived Variable~Implied Quarterly Income Process~…the implied quarterly income process corresponding to the structural model is an IMA (1,1). The author proceeds by time aggregating income and assuming that consumption decisions are made at the quarterly frequency.
151~D2~T3~Time Period~1985.0~…Current Population Survey data is drawn from the March 1985 segment of the survey.
151~D1~DV37~Derived Variable~Variance for Quarterly Income~…the variance for quarterly income is given by the 19 times the variance of the aggregate economic shock plus 6 times the variance of the individual income shock.
151~D1~DV38~Derived Variable~First Autocovariance of Quarterly Income~…the first autocovariance of quarterly income is given by 4 times the variance of the aggregate economic shock minus 3 times the variance of the individual income shock.
151~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Standard Deviation Adjustment and Monthly Differences~…when adjusting the standard deviations obtained from the structural models by the average of the CPI for urban consumers (base 1982-84) over the sample period (which is 105.3), a monthly difference is estimated to be $2,404 and a fourth month difference to be $1,928.
151~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…in order to replicate the results often cited in the literature, the author makes the same adjustments to the NIPA data as Blinder and Deaton (1985) did. However, since the micro level estimates in the previous sections are for households rather than individuals, all macro series used are also on a per household basis rather than on a per capita basis.
151~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…the sample ranges from the first quarter of 1954 to the fourth quarter of 1990; the data are taken from the 1991 Citibase.
151~D3~T4~Time Period~1954-1950~…the NIPA sample ranges from the first quarter of 1954 to the fourth quarter of 1990.
151~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…all data are in levels, not in logs.
151~D3~V3~Variable~Aggregate Income~…there is a slight conceptual difference to the micro estimates since the aggregate income series excludes taxes. However, whether taxes are exluded or not makes little differences for the aggregate estimates.
151~D3~V20~Variable~Proprietor's Income~…for individual income, the author uses an MA(2) model for the first differences of aggregate income but also presents results for an AR(1).
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…MA coefficients are estimated by conditional least squares.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the AR model is estimated by ordinary least-squares.
151~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…unlike the literature, the author does not adjust income and consumption for nontax payments to state and local governments since the series on Citibase is only available starting in 1958. For the post-1958 sample the difference is completely inconsequential.
151~D2~DV36~Derived Variable~Average Household Size~…since no quarterly series of the number of households is available for the sample period, the author linearly interpolated annual estimates of average household size.
151~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Sample Extension and Autocorrelation of Income~…extending the sample from 1984 to 1990 reduces the autocorrelation in the income changes slightly. Both the AR(1) and the MA(2) fit the data well. The quarterly standard deviation for aggregate per household income changes is only around $50, compared to the $2,000 or more that was found for the individual income component.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…it has been customary in the macro literature to use consumer expenditure on nondurables and services as consumption measures. Like Blinder and Deaton, the author eliminated expenditures on clothing and shoes from the nondurable consumption series. To max units comparable to total income, the author multiplied these expenditures by the sample average of the ratio of total expenditures to expenditures on nondurables and services.
151~D3~DV40~Derived Variable~Ratio of Total Expenditures to Nondurable and Service Expenditures~…in order to make consumption units comparable to total income, the author multiplied them by the sample average of the ratio of total expenditures to expenditures on nondurable and services.
151~D3~F7~Findings~Regression Coefficient of Consumption Changes on Lagged Income Changes and Autocorrelation~…the regression coefficient of consumption changes on lagged income changes is estimated in the order of 0.11 and significant. Consumption changes are positively autocorrelated as measured by an AR(1) or MA(1) parameter. The excess smoothness ratio is equal to 0.6. All these estimates are in line with previous findings in the literature.
151~D1, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Consumption Response~…for the lagged information model, consumption changes are an MA(1).
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…in the case of the no information model, aggregate consumption follows an ARIMA(2,1,2) process.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…the base specification uses the quarterly estimates for the individual income process, unadjusted for measurement error, and the 1954 to 1990 results for aggregate income.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the base specification uses the quarterly estimates for the individual income process, unadjusted for measurement error, and the 1954 to 1990 results for aggregate income.
151~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Standard Deviation of Individual Income and Autocorrelation~…in the base case presenting the quarterly estimates for the individual income process, the standard deviation of individual income changes is $2,755 in this case, the first order autocorrelation is -0.27 and the second order autocorrelation is -0.18. In terms of an MA-process this translates into a standard deviation of the innovation of $2,470, and MA coefficients of -0.44 and -0.23.
151~D3~F9~Findings~Full Information Model and Coefficient of Consumption Changes on Lagged Income Changes~…the full information representative agent model implies a coefficient of zero and a regression coefficient on consumption changes to lagged income shocks of 1.31.
151~D1, D2, D3~DV42~Derived Variable~Utility Loss~…both the no aggreate information and full information models present the utility loss for a household. The loss is expressed in dollars per quarter and household and is calculated for a coefficient relative risk aversion of two.
151~D1, D3~F10~Findings~Utility Loss for the No Aggregate Information Model Relative to the Full-Information Model~…the utility loss amounts to 1.50 dollars or 0.02% of total utility.
151~D1, D2, D3~DV43~Derived Variable~Loss For Higher Risk Aversion~…the loss for higher risk aversion is easily obtained by dividing by two and multiplying the new coefficient. Even for a risk aversion coefficient of 10, the loss would still be minor.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…case 2 uses the aggregate estimates for the 1954 to 1984 period.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…case 2 uses the aggregate estimates for the 1954 to 1984 period.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…case 3 presents calculations using the structual estimates for the micro income process from one month differences. In this model most of the transitory variation is removed from the micro income estimates.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…case 3 presents calculations using the structual estimates for the micro income process from one month differences. In this model most of the transitory variation is removed from the micro income estimates.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…case 4 is a variation on the 3rd case.. The structural model underlying these estimates is able to account for interview specific measurement error as well as for telescoping of income reports. In addition, some of the transitory month to month income fluctuations may also be due to measurement error. Case 4 therefore halves the variance of the transitory monthly income component. This reduces the quarterly innovation variance as well the importance of mean reversion.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…case 4 is a variation on the 3rd case.. The structural model underlying these estimates is able to account for interview specific measurement error as well as for telescoping of income reports. In addition, some of the transitory month to month income fluctuations may also be due to measurement error. Case 4 therefore halves the variance of the transitory monthly income component. This reduces the quarterly innovation variance as well the importance of mean reversion.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…case 5 refers to the structural estimates from four month differences.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…case 5 refers to the structural estimates from four month differences.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…case 6 halves the transitory variances from the four month differenced estimates with little change in predictions.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…case 6 halves the transitory variances from the four month differenced estimates with little change in predictions.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in the empirical model, both the aggregate and the individual income component are described by an MA(2).
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…in the empirical model, both the aggregate and the individual income component are described by an MA(2).
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation was conducted in nine interview waves. The sample consisted of four rotation groups. The households in the first rotation groups were interviewed in October, 1983. The ninth interview for the first rotation group was in June, 1986. Similarly, rotation group two was interviewed nine times from November 1983 to July, 1986. Rotation groups three and four were only interviewed eight times so that their first interviews were in November and December, 1983, and their last interviews were in April and May, 1986. 
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…in each interview, questions were asked about income for each of the previous four months. For example, the October, 1983 interview for rotation group one collected information on each month from June to September, 1983.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…monthly income data for all rotation groups are available from September, 1983 to March, 1986. For the quarterly estimates, the author contructed ten observations for the calendar quarters starting with October, 1983 (for the last quarter of 1983) up to March, 1986 (for the first quarter of 1986). Because the quarterly data refer to calendar time, the three income records for a particular quarter and rotation group may come from one or two different interviews.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…to construct the SIPP sample, the author started by matching household heads fro m the eight or nine interview waves. This resulted in 12,874 matches. The author then restricts the matched sample as described in the text by selecting continuous heads for the period of analysis, that did not change marital status or their level of schooling in any month.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…family income is constructed by subtracting property income from total family income.
151~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Net Family Income~…income is deflated by the monthly CPI for urban consumers (base 1982-84).
151~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Age~…the author corrected reported age of the head so that age increments by one every four quarters. The sample only includes heads that were older than 16 years and younger than 70 years throughout the sample.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…only families with complete records on income are included in the final sample which has 8,174 observations.
151~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…the 8,174 observations were utilized for the estimation of the structural models at the monthly frequency but the data were arranged in a different manner. Only waves 1 to 8 were used. For the estimates based on one month differences, the data were stacked.
151~D1~D1~Datsaet~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…notice that part of the data is not used due to the requirement that the panel be balanced so that an equal number of observations is used in calculating each of the moments.
151~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…notice that part of the data is not used due to the requirement that the panel be balanced so that an equal number of observations is used in calculating each of the moments. Corresponding fourth moments to the estimated sample moments were also obtained. For th bootstrap estimation of standard errors household records were drawn with replacement from the set of 8,174 households.
151~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Conditional Least Squares~…notice that part of the data is not used due to the requirement that the panel be balanced so that an equal number of observations is used in calculating each of the moments. Corresponding fourth moments to the estimated sample moments were also obtained. For th bootstrap estimation of standard errors household records were drawn with replacement from the set of 8,174 households.
151~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…the author created the consumption and income series from the National Income and Product Accounts largely following Blinder and Deaton (1985).
151~D3~V3~Variable~Aggregate Income~…the labor income series consists of labor and transfer income (the Citibase Series GW + GPOL + GPT) less social insurance contributions (GPSIN)
151~D3~V3~Variable~Aggregate Income~…to subtract the portion of taxes on labor income, the author created the ratio of wages salaries and other labor income to income including interest, dividends, and rents. Personal tax payments were multiplied by this ratio and the result subtracted from income. Proprietor's income was multiplied by this ratio before adding it to the income series.
151~D1, D3~DV41~Derived Variable~Tax Ratio~…to subtract the portion of taxes on labor income, the author created the ratio of wages salaries and other labor income to income including interest, dividends, and rents.
151~D1, D3~V21~Variable~Personal Tax Payments~…personal tax payments were multiplied by the tax ratio and the result was subtracted from income.
151~D3~V20~Variable~Proprietor's Income~…proprietor's income was multiplied by the tax ratio before adding it to the income series.
151~D3~V3~Variable~Aggregate Income~…income was adjusted in the second quarter of 1975 by subtracting the tax rebate and social security bonus. The amount of this adjustment is taken from Blinder (1981).
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…the real consumption series is constructed by adding the constant dollar expenditures on nondurable and services and subtracting expenditures on clothing and shoes because these have rather durable characteristics (GCN82 + GCS82 - GCNC82). The consumption deflator obtained by dividing the nominal consumption series by the real series is used to deflate income.
151~D3~DV39~Derived Variable~Consumption Deflator~…the consumption deflator obtained by dividing the nominal consumption series by the real series is used to deflate income.
151~D3~DV39~Derived Variable~Consumption Deflator~…both income and consumption are first divided by the total population (GPOP) and then multiplied by the average number of household members.
151~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population survey~…no quarterly series of average houehold size is available for the sample period so the author uses the figures pertaining to March from the Current Population Reports Series P-20, No. 467 for the first quarter and interpoloated the remaining quarters.
151~D2~DV36~Derived Variable~Average Household Size~…no quarterly series of average houehold size is available for the sample period so the author uses the figures pertaining to March from the Current Population Reports Series P-20, No. 467 for the first quarter and interpoloated the remaining quarters. Since average household size is only changing very slowly, this approximation should be rather good.
151~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…quarterly NIPA series are reported at annual rates. All series are divided by four to obtain quarterly amounts.
151~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Consumption~…to make the scale of the consumption series comparable to the income series it is multiplied by the ratio of total expenditures (GC82) to expenditures on nondurable and services.
152~152: Inequality and Poverty in the United States: the Aftermath of the Great Recession~~~~
152~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this paper covers the impacts of the Great Recession on household income inequality and poverty, primarily using data from the Current Population Survey, while also exploring the degree to which the tax and transfer system mitigate these impacts of the Great Recession, and analyze changes in the composition of income between earnings, capital, and transfers.
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~…the Census Bureau's definition of income, which includes some transfer income but does not net out taxes paid, inequality and poverty both rose substantially for all households combined.
152~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Money Income vs. Market Income Poverty Rate~…between 2007 and 2009, the poverty rate among all people rose 15% under both the official definition, which uses Money Income, and market income.
152~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Inequality Measures Under Money Income vs. Market Income Measures~…the P90/P10 ratio rose 6% using Money Income and 21% using equivalized market income, the Gini coefficient rose 1.1 percentage points using money income and 4 percentage pointsusing equivalized market income, suggesting that the distribution of household income grew more unequal between 2007 and 2009. The distribution of workers' hourly wages also rose sharply, with the P90/P10 ratio and the Gini coefficient hitting record highs in 2009 and 2010.
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~"…including taxes and a broader range of transfers than what is included in ""Money Income"" to create a measure of ""Disposable Household Income"" suggests a different picture for poverty and inequality during the Great Recession."
152~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~Inequality Measures Under Disposable Household Income vs. Market Income During the Great Recession~…after adjusting for taxes, transfers, and household size, the Gini Index and the P90/P10 and P90/P50 ratios each declined modestly between 2007 and 2009. The increase in poverty was also blunted, rising only 3 percentage points (for individuals, using the experimental poverty thresholds and income measures recommended by the National Academy of Sciences), compared to 6 percentage points using market income.
152~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…source of experimental poverty thresholds and income measures as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences
152~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~Inequality Measures Under Disposable Household Income vs. Market Income After the Great Recession~…after 2009, as a slow-growing recovery took hold and the temporary economic stimulus measures began to phase out, the P90/P10 ratio equivalized Disposable Household Income rose 4.5% for all households, and 8.8% for non-elderly households between 2009 and 2011; the Gini coefficient rose 3.0% and 3.7%, respectively.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in this research, the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey is the main source of data for analysis.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Annual Social and Economic Supplement, or March Current Population Survey as it is conducted in March of each year, is a survey of approximately 65,000 households that has been conducted annually in the United States for more than 50 years.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source asks respondents to provide detailed income, family and demographic detail fro the previous calendar year.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the current analysis uses data from the surveys conducted between 1980 and 2012, covering household income for the calendar years between 1979 and 2011.
152~D1~T1~Time Period~1980-2012~…survey period from which data from the Current Population Survey is drawn, representing household income for the calendar years between 1979 and 2011.
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~"…baseline analysis focuses on the Census Bureau's ""Money Income"" definition."
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~…money income is a broad income concept, and includes earnings, social insurance benefits, public assistance transfers, pensions and other retirement income, capital income, and other forms of income.
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~…money income does NOT include capital gains income or reflect personal income taxes, social security taxes, union dues, Medicare deductions, or noncash benefit, such as food stamps, employer subsidized health benefits, rent-free housing, and goods produced and consumed on the farm. Money income also does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which often take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc.
152~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Market Income~"…this measure of income removes public transfer payments from the census ""Money Income"" definition."
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~…this measure of income starts with money income and nets out taxes, adding some transfer payments that are not included in money income.
152~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Taxes~…taxes are estimated using the National Bureau of Economic Research TAXSIM model.
152~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Taxes~…using the household income and demographic data from the March Current Population Survey, TAXSIM produces state and federal income taxes, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, as well as FICA social insurance taxes.
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~"…researchers further supplement the baseline Census ""Money Income"" definition by adding estimated food stamp benefits, now referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program."
152~D1, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Food Stamp Benefits~…this estimate combines the Current Population Survey variables for food stamps receipt status, number of beneficiaries, and months of receipt with average monthly benefit amounts from the USDA.
152~D3~D3~Dataset~USDA~…source of average monthly food stamp benefit amounts.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…when considering long-term trends in any income measure, researchers include adjustments for top-coding in the March Current Population Survey, using the consistent cell mean series made available by Larrimore et al. (2008), and also account for the 1994 (Survey Year) series break by smoothing the relevant series at the break-point, similar to approach used by Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011).
152~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Market Income~…this income measures is divided by a standard equivalence scale to account for household economies of scale (the square root of household size).
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~…this income measures is divided by a standard equivalence scale to account for household economies of scale (the square root of household size).
152~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Gini Index~…one of several measures of inequality used throughout this paper.
152~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~P90/P50~…one of several measures of inequality used throughout this paper.
152~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~P90/P10~…one of several measures of inequality used throughout this paper.
152~D1, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Earnings~…a portion of the composition of income; this measure is analyzed in order to see how it has changed in the Great Recession.
152~D1, D3, D6~V1~Variable~Transfers~…a portion of the composition of income; this measure is analyzed in order to see how it has changed in the Great Recession.
152~D1~V2~Variable~Capital Income~…a portion of the composition of income; this measure is analyzed in order to see how it has changed in the Great Recession.
152~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Poverty Rates~…poverty rates are calculated based on both the official poverty thresholds determined by the United States Census brureau, and also the relative measure of poverty (60% of median household income) used by the Europoean Union.
152~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Poverty Rates~…researchers calculate measures of poverty and inequality for the overall population, and also for different age groups and education attainment levels.
152~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Gini Index~…researchers calculate measures of poverty and inequality for the overall population, and also for different age groups and education attainment levels.

152~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…data used in order to explore the impact of changes to tax and transfer policies on poverty with the experimental poverty data published by the Census Bureau.
152~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…researchers use the NAS-recommended poverty thresholds, which reflect regional cost-of-living differences, median consumer expenditures, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.
152~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~NAS Poverty Thresholds~…NAS-recommended poverty thresholds reflecting regional cost-of-living differences, median consumer expenditures, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.
152~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Poverty Rates~…poverty rates are compared by age group based on maret income with those calculated using the expanded after-tax and transfer income also recommended by the NAS.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…one important limitation of the March Current Population Survey is that it does not adequately capture income received by those at the very top of the distribution. The Current Population Survey income data are not only top-coded, but the survey itself does not include sufficient numbers of high-income households to make reliable estimates of incomes at the very top of the distribution, the top one percent of the top one-tenth of one percent, for example.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers use the Outgoing Rotation Group files of the Current Population Survey, with data covering the period from 1979 to 2011, to examine how the Great Recession and other recent recessions have impacted unemployment, labor force participation, and hourl wages.
152~D1~T2~Time Period~1979-2011~…survey period from the Outgoing Rotation Group files of the Current Population Survey during which data on unemployment, labor froce participation, and hourly wages are drawn to examine the impacts of the Great Recession and other recent recessions.
152~D1, D6~F5~Findings~Post-Recession Overall Unemployment Rate Trends~…among 18 to 64 year olds, unemployment averaged 9.0% in 2009 and 9.3% in 2010. The overall rate of unemployment remained slightly lower than the 9.5% rate from 1983.
152~D1, D6~F6~Findings~College and Advanced Graduate Unemployment Rate Recessionary Trends~…among college graduates, the unemployment rate jumped from 2.4% in 2006 to 5.6% in 2010, and among those with advanced degrees it rose from 1.5% to 3.5% in the same period.
152~D1, D6~F7~Findings~Uneducated Unemployment Rate Recessionary Trends~…unemployment among workers with only a high school degree jumped from 5.3% to 12.2% between 2006 and 2010, and among those lacking a diploma it climbed from 8.6% to 17.4%.
152~D1, D6~F8~Findings~Young Household Unemployment Rate Recessionary Trends~…the youngest workers (aged 18 to 24) saw their unemployment rate quickly shoot up from 9% to 17%, and the unemployment rate for somewhat more experienced workers (those aged 25 to 35) went from 4.3% to 9.7%.
152~D6, D7~V4~Variable~Official Unemployment Rate~…the official unemployment rate excludes discouraged workers who have ceased looking for work.
152~D1, D7~F9~Findings~College and Advanced Graduate Labor Force Participation Recessionary Trends~…in 2011, participation fell by 0.7% among college graduates and 0.2% among those with advanced degrees, but it dropped by roughly 2% for all workers with education below the Bachelor's Degree level. For workers with less than a high school degree, the rate of labor force participation slid from 61.6% in 2007 to just 59.4% in 2010.
152~D1, D7~F10~Findings~Experience and Labor Force Participation Recessionary Trends~…among more experienced workers, including those aged 36 to 45 and 46 to 54, the declines were relatively minor, dipping by 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively, between 2006 and 2009. Among workers from 18 to 24, however, the labor force dropp off has been sizable, falling nearly 4.5% from 69.5% in 2006 to 65% in 2010.
152~D1, D7~F11~Findings~Elderly Houeshold Labor Force Participation Recessionary Trends~…the participation rate in the 55 to 64 year old population climbed from 63.7% to 65.1% between 2006 and 2010, continuing a trend where participation rose in 21 of the last 24 years.
152~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Real Hourly Wages~…in the face of a deep and sustained labor market downturn, real hourly wages can be expected to decline.
152~D1, D7~F12~Findings~Mean Hourly Wage Trends During the Great Recession~…between 2007 and 2009, mean hourly wages rose from $20.59 to $21.04. These gains, however, were not shared across the distribution; wages fell at the 10th percentile, rose modestly at the median, but posted solid gains at the 90th percentile. For these three points in the distribution, the changes in real hourly wages between 2006 to 2007 and 2009 to 2010 was -1.9%, 0.8%, and 4.4% respecitvely.
152~D1, D7~F13~Findings~Mean Hourly Wage Trends for Young and Old College Educated Workers During the Great Recession~…young workers (25 to 34 years old) with a BA saw their wages fall 0.1% per year between 2007 and 2009, while older workers (55 to 64 years old) with a bachelor's degree experienced falling wages of an even greater magnitude. The only workers to experience notable gains during the downturn were prime-age workers with post-graduate degrees and training.
152~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Wage Growth by Age and Education~…since 2009, wage growth has turned negative for each age and education group. The biggest losses have been among the least educated, with 2% declines in real hourly wage in 2010 and 2011 for prime-age workers with only a high school degree, and the young, with 2.5% declines for 25 to 34 year olds with a college degree. Wages have fallen nearly as much, however, among the most-highly paid, with losses of 1.5% and higher for workers with advanced degrees.
152~D1~F15~Findings~Wage Inequality During and After the Recession~…the P90/P10 ratio of real hourly wages rose each year between 2007 and 2010, climbing from 4.4 to 4.8.
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~…inflation adjustments are made using the United States Consumer Price Index.
152~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Market Income~…inflation adjustments are made using the United States Consumer Price Index.
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~…inflation adjustments are made using the United States Consumer Price Index.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…it is important to note that, in ALL cases, years are referred to according to the year in which the income was received, NOT the survey years.
152~D1~F16~Findings~Average Real Household Income~…in 2011, average real household income was 5% lower than it had been in 2007, and remained at the lowest level in fourteen years. Median income for all households fell 7.8% over the same period. While averaging money income fell for all households, and for non-elderly households, it actually rose somewhat for households headed by someone age 65 and older, reflecting a longer term trend in elder incomes.
152~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Money Income and According Inequality Measures During and After the Great Recession~…income inequality measured using the money income definition rose steadily over the period from 2007 to 2011: by 2011, the Gini index and the P90/P10 and P90/P50 ratios were all between 3% and 7% higher than levels seen in 2007.
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~"…the baseline Census ""Money Income"" definition includes some sources of transfer income (unemployment, TANF, and Social Security), but it does not include others (such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and SNAP, and it also excludes taxes."
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~…to reflect the influence of all transfers and taxes, researchers calculate a measure of net income which subtracts taxes (including federal and state income taxes and the employee share of social insurance FICA taxes) and additional transfer payments (including the EITC and SNAP benefits) from money income. To reflect household economies of scale, researchers then divide real net household income by the square root of the household size. The resulting measures, equivalized disposable household income, is a superior measure of household well-being, since an equivalent amount of gross money income results in a lower standard of living if family size is larger or applicable taxes are higher.
152~D1, D2, D3~F18~Findings~Disposable Household Income During and After the Great Recession~"…accounting for taxes, transfers, and household size, average household income declined by only 60% as much as when the simple ""Money Income"" definition was used - falling just 2.9% between 2007 and 2011. Non-elderly households follow the same trend, but elderly households saw their incomes rise over this period."
152~D1, D2, D3~F19~Findings~Disposable Household Income Inequality Measures During and After the Great Recession~…accounting for taxes, transfers, and household size, the P90/P10 ratio is shown to decline, rather than rise, between 2007 and 2009. Trends in the P90/P50 ratio tell a very similar, if somewhat muted story.
152~D1, D2, D3~F20~Findings~Income Distribution and Inequality After the Great Recession~…incomes declined across the distribution between 2009 and 2011, but among the non-elderly, the declines at the bottom of the distribution were larger and the declines at the top of the distribution were smaller. As a result, the 90/10 ratio of disposable household income among non-elderly households increased nearly 9%, while the 90/50 ratio rose 3%, and the Gini index rose nearly 4%.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…top-coded observations are assigned the mean value, for each type of income, of the mean from all top-coded observations.
152~D1, D2, D3~F21~Findings~Market Income vs. Disposable Household Income Inequality Measures~…the Gini coefficient for market income rose 3.9% between 2007 and 2009 for all ages of households, but he disposable household income Gini fell by nearly 1%. The P90/P10 ratio rose nearly 21% using market income, but fell almost 3% in disposable household income. The experience among the non-elderly, though, was different, such that the Gini coefficient for disposable household income rose slightly between 2007 and 2009, and the P90/P10 ratio fell only a fraction of the decline seen by all ages of households.
152~V10~L1~Variable Value~Elderly Households~…elderly individuals depend more on income transfers and investment income and less on the labor market than do the non-elderly. This basic fact of the 'by-sources' income distribution is well known and has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent years.
152~V10~L1~Variable Value~Elderly Households~…older workers take up Social Security benefits at high rates once they pass age 62. The 46% of elders who take up benefits between ages 52 and 65 are subject to an earnings test which discourages work in these age ranges. But those who wait until they reach their normal retirement age, 65 to 67 or more, not only recieve higher benefits than at age 62, but are allowed to receive these social pensions without any penalty for earnings.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from the ASEC supplement is used to breakdown the sources of income for the bottom, middle and top quintiles of elderly and non-elderly households.
152~D1, D2, D3~F22~Findings~Transfers Share of Total Income~..using ASEC supplement data from the Current Population Survey, it is found that transfers make up to 90% of income for the poorest fifth of seniors and nearly half of income for the middle fifth of seniors. For non-elderly households, transfers account for 60% of income in the bottom fifth and just 10% in the middle. Reliance on earnings is different, with the elderly getting very little of their income from earnings, and the non-elderly much more.
152~D1~V2~Variable~Capital Income~…includes interest, rent, dividends, and retirement benefits.
152~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Capital Income Share of Total Income~…high-income elderly households rely on capital income for roughly 33% of their income, but capital income accounts for less than 10% of income in the top fifth of non-elderly households.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data sorce does not capture all sources of capital income.
152~D1, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Earnings~…the earnings share of total gross household income is equal to money income plus SNAP benefits and the refundable portions of federal and state EITC benefits.
152~D1, D2, D3~F24~Findings~Earnings Share of Total Income During the Great Recession~…for most households, the earnings share of total gross household income declined between 2007 and 2009. For the middle quintile group of all households and the bottom quintile group of non-elderly households, the drop was approximately 6 percentage points. In the top fifth, though (for both elderly and non-elderly households) the wage share of total income increased between 2007 and 2009, partially offsetting a declining capital income share experienced by both groups.
152~D1, D3, D6~V1~Variable~Transfers~…transfer income includes Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Survivor's Benefits, Disability Payments, Public Assistance, Workers Compensation, Veteran Payments, Child Support, Alimony, Unemployment Compensation, SNAP benefits and the refundable portions of the federal and state EITC benefits and the child tax credit.
152~D1, D2, D3~F25~Findings~Transfer Share of Total Income During the Great Recession~…the transfer share of income rose 4.7% for non-elderly households in the bottom quintile group and 3.4% of those in the middle quintile group, but less than 1% for those in the top quintile group.
152~D1, D2, D3~F26~Findings~Elderly and Transfers Share of Income~…among elderly households in the bottom quintile group, there was no change in the transfer share of income. The transfer share of elderly households in the middle fifth rose more than 6%, but it also rose more than 3% among elderly households in the top fifth.
152~D1~V2~Variable~Capital Income~…capital income in the Census Bureau's Money Income Definition includes only interest, rental income, dividends, rent, trust, and retirement savings income. This measure does NOT include capital gains income.
152~D1, D2~F27~Findings~Elderly and Capitals Share of Income~…the decline in the capital income share was most notable for the top quintile group, where the capital share fell from 7.1% to 6.2% for non-elderly households and from 38.3% to 32.6% for elderly households.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…because of income top-coding and the presence of relatively few extremely high income households in the sample, it is not possible to use the March Current Population Survey to estimate inequality at the very top of the income distribution.
152~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~P90/P10~…to the extent that the top few percentiles are driving inequality, these ratios calculated with the March Current Population Survey understate the level of inequality at any point in time and possibly the trend toward greater inequality over time.
152~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Gini Index~…to the extent that the top few percentiles are driving inequality, these ratios calculated with the March Current Population Survey understate the level of inequality at any point in time and possibly the trend toward greater inequality over time.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…statistics calculated using this data show rising inequality for market income during the Great Recession.
152~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…income figures based on this data are unable to capture what is going on at the very top distribution due to top-coding.
152~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Market Income~…income figures based on the Current Population Survey are unable to capture what is going on at the very top distribution due to top-coding.
152~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Money Income~…income figures based on the Current Population Survey are unable to capture what is going on at the very top distribution due to top-coding.
152~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Disposable Household Income~…income figures based on the Current Population Survey are unable to capture what is going on at the very top distribution due to top-coding.
152~D5~D5~Dataset~Congressional Budget Office~…source of comprehensive income series calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, available up through 2009.
152~D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Comprehensive Income~…the comprehensive income series calculated by the Congressional Budget Office does include taxes and transfers, and also allows researchers to look at the top of the distribution, but is only available up through 2009.
152~D5~T3~Time Period~1979-2009~…source period of Congressional Budget Office data from which comprehensive income series is available.
152~D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Comprehensive Income~…this measure is much more expansive than Census Money Income, and by statistically matching the Census data to IRS tax return data (i.e. findings in external literature), it includes much more in realized property income. Comprehensive income also includes imputations to reflect the market value of private and public health insurance.
152~D5~F28~Findings~CBO Income Trends~…even with the base expanded to include the relatively equalizing influence of public and private health insurance, the Congressional Budget Office data shows that the income share of the richest households has surge in recent decades. The top 1% share of income more than doubled between 1979 and 2007. Reflecting the highly cyclical nature of some of the capital income sources held by these high-income households, the top 1% plunged dramatically in the early 2000s recession and in the Great Recession. Even in 2009, though, the top 1% share remained nearly 60% higher than levels from 30-years earlier.
152~D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Comprehensive Income~…this income measure is broader than most income concepts, but it excludes a large portion of capital income which accrues largely to the top of the distribution.
152~D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Comprehensive Income~…includes interest, rent, and dividends, and realized capital gains (and losses), but the vast majority of capital income is not realized in a given year, including imputed rent on owner-occupied homes as well as accumulated financial and business wealth.
152~D1, D2~F29~Findings~Share of Households in Poverty~"…according to the official U.S. Government definition of poverty (using the Census ""Money Income"" definition), the share of households in poverty rose to 13.4% in 2009, and has continue to rise since, reaching 14.3% in 2011, reaching the same high levels hit in previous downturns."
152~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Poverty Rates~…researchers show poverty among household units for comparability to the grouping used in the income inequality section, but the Census Bureau prefers to present poverty figures for either individuals or families.
152~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…researchers show poverty among household units for comparability to the grouping used in the income inequality section, but the Census Bureau prefers to present poverty figures for either individuals or families (families do not include single individuals or unrelated groups of people living together).
152~D6~DV15~Derived Variable~EU Poverty Thresholds~…the broader definition of poverty adopted by the European Union - set at 60% of median household income - is considerably higher than the official United States definition and fluctuates less over time.
152~D1, D2, D4~F30~Findings~European Union Poverty Measure~…over most of the last 30 years, the European Union poverty measure hovered at 30% in good and bad economic times. Between 2007 and 2010, this measure of poverty rose from 30.2% to 31%, before falling back to 30.5% in 2011.
152~V10~L19~Variable Value~Young Households~…includes those households headed by individuals under the age of 35.
152~D1~F31~Findings~Young Households and Poverty Rates~…amongst younger households, poverty rates hit 30-year highs in 2010 and 2011. Between 2007 and 2010, the official poverty rate rose from 28.1% to 37.3% for households headed by individuals under age 25. For households with heads between 25 and 34, poverty rose from 14.3% to 18.7% in 2011. 
152~D1~F32~Findings~Elderly Households and Poverty Rates~…consistent with previous literature, poverty among elderly households fell during the Great Recession, from 11.6% in 2007 to 10.3% in 2009, hitting a new 30-year low. In 2010, the poverty rate among the elderly rose back up to 10.6%, before falling back to 10.3% in 2011.
152~D1~F33~Findings~Children Presence and Poverty Rates~…for households with children, the poverty rate rose 3.8 percentage points between 2007 and 2011, returning to previous high-points from the early 1980s and early 1990s. Among households without children, poverty rose by similar levels, but now exceeds high-points from those previous recessions by nearly 40%, and 25% higher than the recession from the early 2000s.
152~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~"…to understand the impact of changes in taxes and transfers on poverty during and after the Great Recession, researchers turn to experimental poverty figures produced directly by the Census Bureau. These experiemtnal figures reflect improvements to the measurement of poverty recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. The NAS recommedations, subsequent Census Bureau refinements of them, alter the resources available to household beyond what is included in ""Money Income"" by adding other transfers income and subtracting taxes. These measures go further still by adding in the value of subsidized housing and school lunhes, and energy assistance, and subtracting work-related expenses including child care."
152~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~NAS Income~…experimental income benchmarks used in order to produce experiemental poverty figures reflecting improvements to the measurement of poverty recommended by the National Academy of Sciences.
152~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~NAS income~"…NAS recommendations alter the resources availabel to household beyond what is included in ""Money Inccome"" by adding other transfers income and subtracting taxes (similar in spirit to the disposable household income calculations used earlier in this research for measuring inequality). The NAS measures go further still, however, by also adding in the value of subsidized housing and school lunches, and energy assistance, and subtracting work-related expenses including child care."
152~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~NAS Poverty Thresholds~…compared to the official poverty definitions, the NAS also adjusts poverty thresholds over time not by changes in the CPI, but by changes in median expenditures on necessities and adjusts for cost-of-living differences across areas (using HUD fair market rents) as well as for out-of-pocket medical expenses.
152~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…researchers use Census figures to show the impacts of taxes and transfers, by comparing poverty rates using market income and the expanded version of income recommended by the NAS.
152~D1, D2~F34~Findings~NAS Poverty Measure~…overall, the experimental NAS measure results in a slightly higher poverty rate in most years; the 2011 poverty rate (for individuals) was 14.9% using the official definition and 16.9% using NAS-recommended income and thresholds.
152~D1, D2~F35~Findings~NAS Poverty vs. Market Income Poverty~…the most dramatic difference between the NAS measure and the market income measure is in the age composition of poverty; by taking medical expenditures into account, the NAS measure results in higher poverty among older individuals and lower poverty among younger ones when compared to the official measures.
152~D1, D2~F36~Findings~Post-Tax and Transfer Poverty Rates~…the post-tax and transfer poverty rate in the 45 to 64 age range was 10.1% in 2006, 13.1% in 2009, and 13.4% in 2011. By contrast, among elderly, poverty either rose very little or actually fell, depending on whether rate are compared from 2006 or 2007. Between 2006 and 2009, poverty amng the elderly rose just 1.4 points, or 10%, using NAS definitions, far smaller increases than any other age groups.
152~D1, D2~F37~Findings~NAS Income vs. Market Income Poverty Distribution~…when contrasting poverty rates based on market income and the after-tax and transfer NAS income for different age groups, showing the trends relative to 2007, for all individuals, poverty rose 20% between 2007 and 2009 using market income, but just 9% using NAS income.
152~D1, D2~F38~Findings~NAS Income vs. Market income Post-Tax and Transfer Poverty Rates and NAS Poverty Rates~…when contrasting poverty rates based on market income and the after-tax and transfer NAS income for different age groups, showing the trends relative to 2007, post tax and transfer poverty rose 15% for working-age sub groups, but fell by 5% among the elderly. Since 2009, NAS-measure poverty has continued to decline sharply among the elderly, fallen slightly among those aged 25 to 44, and risen somewhat among those 45 to 64.

153~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data used in this research paper are from the Current Population Survey.
153~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…raced between the 25th and 75th centiles relative to the median wage.
153~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the population refers to men, aged 25 to 54, who are not self-employed and work full-time for at least 14 weeks.
153~D1~T1~Time Period~1963-1990~…over this period, wages above the median increased relative to the median; wages below the median fell relative to the median. Note that growth in dispersion has been more or less constant.
153~D1~T2~Time Period~1966-1969~…time period through which there appears to have been compression of extremely low wages between 1967 and 1969. In the period, the way that wages were reported moved steadily toward less bunching up in recorded values of earnings.
153~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…annual earnings divided by the product of weeks worked and an instrument for usual hours per week.
153~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Usual Hours Per Week~…the instrument is computed with the 1976 to 1991 surveys using observations relating age, race, schooling, hours worked in the week preceding the survey, and weeks worked to usual hours.
153~D1~T4~Time Period~1963-1975~…weeks within reported intervals are imputed for years before 1975 using the auxiliary relations observed subsequently.
153~D1~T3~Time Period~1976-1991~…time period from which observations from the Current Population Survey are drawn relating to age, race, schooling, hours worked in the week preceding the survey, and weeks worked to usual hours.

153~D1~F1~Findings~Logarithmic Spread Increase at 75th and 90th Centile~…from 1963 to 1990, the logarithmic spread between the median and the 75th centile increased by 0.117, while the spread to the 90th centile grew by 0.168. These increases range between one-third and one-half of the 1963 spreads.
153~D1~F2~Findings~Logarithmic Spread Increase at 10th and 25th Centile~…at the lower extreme, measured from 1969 forward, the increase in spread at the 10th centile is 0.197, and for the 25th centile it is 0.120.
153~D1~F3~Findings~Logarithmic Spread Implications~...if the logarithmic spread between the median and the 75th and 25th centiles each increase by 0.12 then the wage at the 75th centile will have increased 27.1% relative to the 25th centile wage; an increased logarithmic spread of 0.17 in either direction implies a relative wage change of 40.5%.
153~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~College to High-School Graduate Ratio~…the ratio of college to high-school graduate wages.
153~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Late Career to Early Career Ratio~…the ratio of earnings 26 to 35 years out of school relative to earnings of new job-market entrants.

153~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~College to High-School Graduate Ratio~…the education story is perhaps the best known: the college wage premium drifted downward during the 1970's before reversing trend and moving to levels in the 1980's that are higher than any seen before.
153~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Late Career to Early Career Ratio~…the experience differential declined throughout the 1980's for college graduates and it has declined since 1985 for high-school graduates, but the recent decline has not reversed the longer trend of increasing the value of work experience.
153~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~College to High-School Graduate Ratio~…the calculations of wage ratios begin with observations of hourly earnings distinguished by potential work experinece (age - years of schooling - 6), education, gender, and race.
153~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Late Career to Early Career Ratio~…the calculations of wage ratios begin with observations of hourly earnings distinguished by potential work experinece (age - years of schooling - 6), education, gender, and race.
153~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Men to Women Wage Ratio~…the calculations of wage ratios begin with observations of hourly earnings distinguished by potential work experinece (age - years of schooling - 6), education, gender, and race.

153~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Average Wages~…refers to trimmed means within gender, race, education, and five-year experience intervals.
153~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~College to High-School Graduate Ratio~…education components of changing wage patterns are consistent with the simple observation that values of intellectual or cognitive skills are increasing relative to physical skills.
153~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Late Career to Early Career Ratio~…experience components of changing wage patterns are consistent with the simple observation that values of intellectual or cognitive skills are increasing relative to physical skills.
153~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Men to Women Wage Ratio~…gender components of changing wage patterns are consistent with the simple observation that values of intellectual or cognitive skills are increasing relative to physical skills.
153~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~White to Black Wage Ratio~…the story of race convergence in wages is not consistent with the simple observation that values of intellectual or cognitive skills are increasing relative to physical skills in the sense that part of it is skill convergence. When the racial convergence is partitioned into convergence within levels of schooling and convergence in school completion, per se, it is found that almost all of the within-schooling convergence is between cohorts.
153~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…researchers begin analysis with a synthetic wage distribution where all men, aged 25 to 54, are assigned a wage. The wage has two parts, a fitted value and a residual.
153~DV1~L7~Variable Value~Fitted Value~…the fitted value of wage is based on age, schooling, race, and weeks worked.
153~DV1~L7~Variable Value~Fitted Value~…the fitted value is from a regression on wages of men.

153~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Percent College Graduates~…the percent of men aged 25 to 54 who are college graduates, separated by hourly wage quartile.
153~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Percent Black~…the percent of men aged 25 to 54 who are black, separated by hourly wage quartile.
153~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Percent FTE Employed~…the percent of men aged 25 to 54 who are full-time employed (or equivalent), separated by hourly wage quartile.
153~D1~F4~Findings~Fourth Quartile Age Distribution~…since wages are higher for older men, the percentage is greater in the fourth quartile of the wage distribution of men aged 25-54 who are at least 35 year olds than at lower quartiles.
153~D1~F5~Findings~Quartile Graduate Distribution~"…by the late 1980's, almost half of the men in the top quarter of the wage distribution were college graduates; only ~20% of those in the second quartile and only ~10% in the lowest quartile were college graduates."
153~V1~L9~Variable Value~Black~…on average, black men earn less than whites.
153~D1~F6~Findings~Quartile Race Distribution~…because black men earn less than whites, the percentages of black men in the higher quartiles is lower; however, the representation of black men has increased steadily in the upper two quartiles over the relevant time period. The representation of blacks among men who are in the second wage quartile has been roughly constant and has fallen sharply in the lowest quartile.
153~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~FTE Employment~…these calculations measure the proportion of weeks worked full-time plus one-half the proportion of weeks worked part-time.
153~D1~F7~Findings~Wage and Time Worked Alignment~…from 1967 forward, wages and time worked are increasingly aligned. The evolution of this covariance points to more rapid growth in the dispersion of annual income than is found for hourly wages.
153~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Percent Married~…traces the percentages of men 25 to 54 who are married, separated by hourly wage quartile.
153~D1~F8~Findings~Quartile Marital Rates and Earnings for Single and Married Men~…overall, marital rates have dropped, and they have done so within each quartile. On average, single men earn less than married men, and the percentage who are married is lower in the lower quartiles. The percentage of married men in the lowest quarter of the wage distribution dropped from 81% to 53% between 1966 and 1990; in the top quarter, it fell from 94.3% to 82.5%.
153~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Percent Wives College Graduates~…traces the percentages of wives who are college graduates.

153~D1~V7~Variable~Annual Earnings of Wives~…shows the annual earnings of working wives.
153~D1~F9~Findings~Education Levels of Couples~…the education levels of husbands and their wives are positively correlated.
153~D1~F10~Findings~College Wage Premium and Top Quartile College Graduate Representation~…as the college wage premium was increased for men, it has increased the representation of college graduates among the highest-paid men, and it has increased the representation of college graduates among the wives of the highest-paid men.
153~D1~F11~Findings~Quartile Wage Distribution for Women Over the Relevant Period~…in 1963, the working wives of men in the top quarter of the wage distribution earned about 93% as much annually as the wives of men whose wages placed them in the lowest quarter of the distribution. By 1990, the wives of top quartile men averaged 30% more than the wives of men in the first quartile of the distribution.
153~D1~F12~Findings~Female Propensity to Work Over Time~…at the beginning of the data, the chance that a wife would work was inversely related to her husband's wage, but as participation has increased generally, the correspondence between husband's wage and wife's annual participation has vanished.
156~156: Inference on Regressions with Interval Data on a Regressor or Outcome~~~~
156~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…interval data on wealth.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…under the questionnaire protocol of this data, a respondent is asked to report their welath, and if they do not comply, the respondent is then asked to report if wealth falls within a sequence of brackets.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…this data yields a wealth interval for each respondent; an interval which is degenerate when a respondent provides a point value of wealth, is an informative interval of positive width when the respondent answers the subsequent bracket questions, and is the uninformative interval from negative infinity to positive infinity otherwise.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…a wealth interval is generated for each respondent of the Health and Retirement Study.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…this interval is degenerate when a respondent provides a point value of wealth, is an informative interval of positive width when the respondent answers the subsequent bracket questions and is the uninformative interval from negative infinity to postive infinity otherwise.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…represents a generalization of the familiar problem of variable censoring, wherein wealth is sometimes measured precisely and otherwise is not observed at all.
156~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Expected Value ~…the expected value of an outcome dependent on an explanatory variable and wage.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…interval measurement implies that the data alone do not identify the expected value of the outcome, but there is much scope for inference by combining the data with various assumptions on the distribution of the population.
156~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Binary Outcome~…the outcome being estimated in this case is a binary outcome whose value is determined by a common threshold-crossing condition with unobservable variation across the population.
156~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Tractable Estimator~…modifies the maximum score method to cope with interval data.
156~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Tractable Estimator~…researchers compute this estimator in three steps, first by presenting a lemma showing that the elements of the set are the solutions to a certain maximization problem, then by proposing a sample analog of this maximization problem as an estimator for the set, and then by slightly weakening the estimator to encompass approximate solutions of the sample maximization problem.
156~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Tractable Estimator~…extends the maximum score method to settings with interval data on wealth.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…if wealth was always measured precisely, wealth would be equal to both ends of the interval.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…researchers use linear and binary response models to generate outcome data.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…researchers use linear and binary response models to generate outcome data.
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…researchers use linear and binary response models to generate outcome data.
156~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Parameter Vector~…researchers specify a value for the parameter vector that includes three separate outcome components.
156~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Random Vector~…researchers specify a distribution for the random vector that includes wealth, an explanatory variable, and the error term.
156~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Parameter Vector~…experiments reported in this research paper set the parameter vector to (1, 1, -1).
156~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Random Vector~…experiments reported in this research paper make the random vector statistically independent.
156~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Error Term~…set to the standard distribution for the purposes of simulated estimations.
156~D1~DV7~Variable~Wealth~"…divided into two alternative distributions where one experiment group has wealth~N(0,2) and the other has wealth~U(-2,3)."
156~D1~V2~Variable~Explanatory Variable~"…divided into two alternative distributions where one experient group has x~N(1,4) and the other has x~U(0,5)."
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…experimenters generate interval data on wealth by rounding the wealth down and up to the nearest integer, a procedure that is common practice suggesting relevancy to the topic of interest.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…the intervals yielded by integer rounding all have width one, leading to 1/root2 of the standard deviation of wealth under the normal design and 1/5 of the width of the support of wealth under the uniform design.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…in baseline estimates, researchers limited to sample sizes of 200 and 800, where in each case researchers draw 100 independent pseudo-samples and report various features of the empirical distributions of the estimates.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…in baseline estimates, researchers draw a single sample of size 20,000 and report the estimates obtained.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…in baseline estimates, researchers limited to sample sizes of 200 and 800, where in each case researchers draw 100 independent pseudo-samples and report various features of the empirical distributions of the estimates.

156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~...extends the minimum distance method to settings with interval data on wealth.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…the rate of convergence of the MMD estimator's main coefficient of interest depends on the taail behavior of the distribution of the main explanatory variable in this case.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…the MMD estimates are obtained using the method of simulated annealing.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…the MMS estimates are obtained using a modified version of the MSCORE program described in Manski and Thompson, where a scale normalization is needed for each estimation.
156~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Baseline MMD Interval Estimates~…the MMD estimates are extremely narrow intervals containing the true value -1; the intervals are (-.99, -1.00) for the linear model and (-1.01, -.99) for the binary response model.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…the rounding process for generating the wealth interval does not satisfy the sufficient conditions for point identifcation.
156~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Normal Design Intervals~…under the normal design, every interval is narrow, the widest being (.94, 1.08) in the case of the MMS estimator.
156~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Uniform Design Intervals~…under the uniform design, the narrowest interval is (-1.09, -.84) for the MMD estimator , and the widest is (.56, 1.47) for the MMS estimator.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…data used in order to estimate regressions of smoking behavior on wealth and other covariates.
156~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in order to estimate regressions of home ownership on income and other covariates.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…some of this wealth data are point values and some are intervals of varying widths.
156~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all of this data are intervals of fixed widths.
156~D1~V3~Variable~Nonsmoker~…a binary indicator variable that equals 1 if a person reports that he or she is a nonsmoker and equals 0 if he or she is a smoker.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…the data concern 6898 respondents to the 1994 wave of the Health and Retirement Study.
156~D1~T1~Time Period~1994.0~…survey year in which all Health and Retirement Study data was drawn.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…respondents to this data were asked to provide point values for their debt and for their holdings of various assets incluing housing vehicles, farm/business equity, IRAs, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, and certificate of deposits.
156~D1~V4~Variable~Debt~…a point value of an individual respondent's debt in order to calculate wealth.

156~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Wealth~…the sum of debt and assets constitutes wealth.
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…respondents who did not know or who otherwise refused to report a point value for some component of wealth were asked whether its value lies within a certain sequence of brackets
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…point measurements of wealth were obtained from 4,216 respondents, informative interval measurements from 2,041, and uninformative intervals from the remaining 641.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…when the data obtained from a respondent did not reveal a lower or upper bound on wealth, researchers set bounds at -10^9 or 10^9 dollars respectively.
156~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Wealth Interval~…included as an explanatory in all regressions using Health and Retirement Study data.
156~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Age~…included as an explanatory in all regressions using Health and Retirement Study data.

156~D1~V8~Variable~Body Mass~…included as an explanatory in all regressions using Health and Retirement Study data.
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…when presenting point and interval regression estimates on wealth and smoking, two maximum likelihood point estimates of a logit binary response model, accompanied by delat-method confidence regions.
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…one estimate uses all 6898 observations and applies the HRS-provided wealth imputations when point wealth data are not available; this estimates is only consistent if the logit model is correct and the Health and Retirement Study's imputations somehow succeed in measuring wealth without error.
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…one estimate uses only the 4216 observations where point measurements of wealth were obtained; this method is consistent only if the logit model is correct and assumption MI holds.
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…this method positions the nonsmoker as the dependent variable and wealth, age, education and body mass as explanatory variables.
156~D1~F4~Findings~Wealth Interval Estimates w/ and w/o Imputations~…the wealth estimate is 1.47 with confidence region (1.05, 1.89) when imputations are not used, but shrinks to 0.0452 with confidence region (0.179, 0.0726) when the imputations are used, a finding that should serve as a warning against casual use of the Health and Retirement Study's wealth imputations.
156~D1~F5~Findings~Overall Relation Between Nonsmoker and Explanatory Variables~…both of the estimates using the logit model with the Health and Retirement Study data indicate that the probability of being a nonsmoker increases with wealth, age, schooling, and body mass with coefficients
156~D1~D1~Dataset~Health and Retirement Study~…this data does not formally meet the unbounded support conditions for point convergence of MMS estimates.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…to achieve the scale normalization required in this estimation model, researchers set the coefficient on the constant equal to -4, a value that falls within the corresponding MMD interval estimate facilitating comparison between the two models.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…the success of this estimator is dependent on the correctness of the Logit model and that the IMMU assumptions hold.
156~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Bootstrap Confidence Regions~…researchers treat the sample data as if they were the population and carry out a Monte Carlo simulation in which the data are sampled randomly N times with replacement.
156~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Similarity of Nonsmoker Estimates Across Models~…the estimates of the wealth, age, body mass, and constant parameters vary across the three methods, MMD, MMS, and logit ML, only in their second significant digits.
156~D2~V9~Variable~Rent Status~…a binary indicator variable that equals 1 if a person rents his residence, and equals 0 if he owns his home.
156~D2~V10~Variable~Family Income~…takes the place of the interval-measured covariate wealth in all Current Population Survey analysis.
156~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Education~…a covariate specifying for years of schooling included in Current Population Survey analysis on family income and homeownership.
156~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Age~…a covariate included in Current Population Survey analysis on family income and homeownership.

156~D2~T2~Time Period~1995.0~…survey year in which all Current Population Survey data was collected.
156~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…respondents were asked to report their total family income for 1994 within 40 intervals of width 2500 dolars each.
156~D2~V10~Variable~Family Income~…total family income for the year 1994 was reported through 40 intervals of width 2500 dollars each.
156~V10~L1~Variable Value~(0, 2499)~…the initial family income value of the 40 interval options of width 2500 dollars each.
156~V10~L2~Variable Value~(97500, 99999)~…the final family income value of the 40 interval options of width 2500 dollars each.
156~V10~L3~Variable Value~Residual Interval~…the residual interval was (100000, infinity).
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…when using Current Population Survey data, these regressions provide estimates of home ownership on income.
156~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Logit ML~…to compute the ML estimates, researchers restricted attention to persons with income below $100,000 and used the midpoint of the reported income interval as a point imputation of income; the intervals have width $2,500, so the maximum measurement error in these imputations is $1250.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…when using Current Population Survey data, these regressions provide estimates of home ownership on income.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…when using Current Population Survey data, these regressions provide estimates of home ownership on income.
156~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit MMD~…in Current Population Survey data analysis, these estimates presume that the probability of renting one's residence decreases weakly with income.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…in Current Population Survey data analysis, these estimates presume that the probability of renting one's residence decreases weakly with income.
156~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~MMS~…in all Current Population Survey data analysis, to normalize the scale of the MMS estimates, researchers set the coefficient on the constant equal to 3, a value that falls within the corresponding MMD interval estimate, which is (2.97, 3.11).
156~D2~F7~Findings~Overall Relation Between Rent Status and Explanatory Variables. ~…the probability of renting a home decreases with family income, age, and years of schooling with coefficients of -0.0286, -0.0482, and -0.0739 respectively.
156~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Warning of Imputation Use ~…the point estimates obtained by maximum likelihood using interval midpoint imputations are systematically arger in magnitude than the MMD and MMS estimates, suggesting, as in the HRS application, use of imputations to cope with interval data yields a different empirical perspective than one obtains when imputations are not used.
157~157: Information Heterogeneity and Intended  College Enrollment~~~~
157~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
157~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Education Level~…a binary variable specifying for college- and non-college households.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…in order to examine people's information sets and decisions, researchers added a novel set of questions to the August 2013 Survey of Consumer Expectations, a nationally representative survey of United States household heads run by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…researchers surveyed 1,020 household heads about their perceived college costs and rewards as well as their own (past) college enrollment decisions and their intended college enrollment decisions regarding their pre-college age children.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…importantly, researchers make a distinction between perceptions of college returns for the United States population on average, and for the individual themselves. In this paper, researchers refer to income differentials by education levels as returns to education; however, this term is not meant to imply causal returns to schooling.
157~V2~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…the perception of college returns for the entire United States population on average; pertain to perceptions of college benefits for the population as a whole.
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~…the perception of college returns for the individual respondent themselves; pertain to perceptions of college benefits for the individual's own selves or their child.
157~V2~L3~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (Cost)~…the perception of college costs for the entire United States population on average; pertain to perceptions of college expenses for the population as a whole.
157~DV1~L4~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (Cost)~…the perception of college costs for the individual respondent themselves; pertain to perceptions of college expenses for the individual's own selves or their child.
157~D1~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…the distinction between population beliefs and self beliefs is important because population measure an individual's stock of knowledge at a given point in time and can be directly validated, while self beliefs form the basis of the individual's own decision-making.
157~D1, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Self Beliefs~…the distinction between population beliefs and self beliefs is important because population measure an individual's stock of knowledge at a given point in time and can be directly validated, while self beliefs form the basis of the individual's own decision-making.
157~D1, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Self Beliefs~…a comparison of self beliefs with actual statistics is ill-advised, because the two may not correspond for several reasons; for example, individuals may have private information about themselves (such as abilitiy and interests) that may justify having self beliefs that differ from actual statistics.
157~D1~F1~Findings~RCE by Education Level~…the ratio of average annual earnings by college-educated and non-college educated respondents to the Current Population Survey has remained largely stable, fluctuating between 1.78 and 1.83 from 2002 to 2012.
157~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…contains information on the average annual earnings of college- and non-college-educated respondents over time.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…the respondents to this data correctly perceive positive returns to a college education for the average individual, while the respondents incorrectly perceive actual college costs.
157~V2~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…the respondents to this data correctly perceive positive returns to a college education for the average individual.
157~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Perceived vs. Actual Population Beliefs (RCE) ~…on average, respondents to the Survey of Consumer Expectations believe that current 40 year old college-graduate workers earn 1.7 time more than non-college workers, while the true population relative college earnings is 1.83; that is, respondents on average underestimate college benefits by 0.13. In fact, it is found that nearly 75% of the respondents of the Survey of Consumer Expectations underestimate the population relative college earnings.
157~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Perceived vs. Actual Population Beliefs (Cost)~…on average, respondents to the Survey of Consumer Expectations believe that the average annual total cost (tuition, room, and board) of a 4-year bachelor's degree at a public (private) university is $29,100 ($40,000). These perceptions do not compare very favorably with objective statistics: according to the College Board, in 2012, average annual net (sticker) costs at 4-year public universities were $12,400 ($18,170), while at private universities were $22,590 ($40,220). Thus respondents' perceptionson average exceed actual college costs, with their responses being closer to sticker rather than net costs. 
157~V2~L3~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (Cost)~…respondents' perceptions on average exceed actual college costs, with their responses being closer to sticker than net costs.
157~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Average Absolute Error~…the average absolute gap between perceived and actual college costs.
157~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Perceived vs. Actual Population Absolute~…the average absolute error between perceived and actual college costs is quite large, varying between $13,600 and $18,900.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…while there is substantial heterogeneity in perceptions, the distribution of perceptions is skewed to the right of the objective numbers: researchers find that the perceived public university cost of 77%  (86%) of the respondents are above the actual sticker (net) public costs.
157~V2~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…household heads without a college degree and those residing in areas with a lower proportion of college educated adults, on average, report lower population relative college earnings.
157~V2~L3~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (Cost)~…college-educated, higher-income, higher-numeracy respondents as well as those with a child who has attended college all have relatively more accurate perceptions regarding college costs (with households with lower-income or without a college degree reporting higher costs).
157~D1~F5~Findings~Observable Characteristics Explanation of Population Beliefs~…observable characteristics explain less than 10% of the variation in population beliefs.
157~D1~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…while geographic variation in college returns and costs un surprisingly explains some of the cross-sectional heterogeneity in perceptions regarding population college benefits and costs, the demogarphic heterogeneity in accuracy of population beleifs that researchers unearth persists even using local measures of actual college returns and costs.
157~D1~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…United States households, on average, seem to underestimate the benefits of a college degree and overestimate the costs, and these systematic biases seem to be larger for more disadvantaged households.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…researchers asked respondents about their current earnings as well as their earnings in the counterfactual state (for example, for a college-educated respondent, their earnings had they not obtained a college degree).
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~"…using responses in the Survey of Consumer Expectations about an individual respondent's current earnings as well as their earnings in the counterfactual state, researchers derive the respondent's ""self RCE""."
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~…respondents recognize the positive returns to a college education, with the average self relative college earnings in the sample of nearly 2.
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~…consistent with experiences affecting beliefs, researchers see that college-educated respondents who themselves receive lower returns (as proxied by their income) report a lower self perception of relative college earnings.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~..the main object of interest measured from this data is the respondent's reported likelihood of their (pre-college age, defined as ages 6 to 17) child attending college in the future, and their beliefs regarding their child's future earnings with and without a college degree (which allow researchers to derive the perceived child's relative college earnings). These questions are asked of respondents who have a child in this age range; these individuals comprise about a quarter of the relevant sample.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…the main object of interest is the respondents' reported likelihood of their (pre-college age, defined as ages 6-17) child attending college in the future.
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…the perceived future earnings of an individual respondent's child with and without a college degree used to derive the perceived child's relative college earnings.
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…the perceived child's relative college earnings derived from Survey of Consumer Expectations responses regarding a parent's beliefs about their child's future earnings with  and without a college degree.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…the advantage of eliciting intended behavior about an action that is yet to be undertaken is that it can be investigated as to how it is affected by respondent's current stock of knowledge (as measured by their population beliefs).
157~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Gap in College Attendance Likelihood by Income Level~…researchers find a statistically and economically significant gap of nearly 20 points in the intended likelihood of the child's college attendance by parents' income or education status: for example, the mean likelihood for higher-income households is 85%, versus 66% for their lower-income counterparts.
157~D2~V3~Variable~Household income~…the level of income for households in the Current Population Survey.
157~V3~L6~Variable Value~High-Income~…defined as households with income above the United States median of $50,000.
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…the child's expected earnings with a college degree relative to no college degree.
157~D1, D3~F8~Findings~Mean Child's RCE~…the mean child's relative perceived college earnings in the sample is 2.2 and quite heterogeneous.
157~D1, D2, D3~F9~Findings~Child's RCE and Future Attendance~…it is found that a respondent's child's RCE is: a significant predictor of the child's intended future college attendance - i.e. a 0.2 increase in the child's RCE (at the average RCE) increases the intended likelihood by about 2 percentage points - and is positive and signficantly related to the perceived population RCE; the coefficient implies that an underestimation of the population RCE by 0.2 points is related with a 0.1 point decline in the child's RCE.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…given that the respondents to the Survey of Consumer Expenditures, on average, underestimate the population relative college earnings, this on average biases downward the intended likelihood of the child attending college (with the bias larger for groups, such as non-college household heads, that have a larger average underestimation of the population RCE).
157~D1, D2, D3~F10~Findings~Information Interventions and Likelihood of College Attendance~…given model specifications, researchers see that information interventions would increase the average perceived likelihood college attendance in the relative sample from 78% to 83%. Furthermore, the increases are, on average, larger for groups with greater underestimations of the popualation RCE; for example, the mean intended likelihood of non-college respondents' children attending college jumps from 71% to 78%, whereas that of college-educated households' rises from 80% to 92%.
157~V1~L7~Variable Value~Non-College~…throughout the paper, the term non-college respondent is used to refer to individuals in the relevant sample who do not have a 4-year bachelor's degree.
157~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~Information Interventions and Gap by Income~…as a result of information intervention simulations, the gap by income declines from 19 percentage points to 10 percentage points.
157~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~Information Interventions and Likelihood of Attendance~…as a result of information intervention simulations, the increase in respondents' intended likelihood is 0.19 standard deviations of the baseline likelihood.
157~D1, D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Future Attendance~…while perceived college costs do not seem to directly impact the intended likelihood of child's college attendance, researchers present suggestive evidence that respondents' elasticity of college attendance with respect to college costs is not zero, and varies between -0.5 and -2.1, depending on the group.
157~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~Current Low-Income Elasticity~…the current elasticity estimate of 1.80 for low-income households is very similar in magnitude to that presented by Dynarski (2003), who estimates an elasticity of college attendance of -1.5 among low-income households; the fact that the current estimate, deduced from perceptions, is very close to Dynarski's, which is arrived at using realized outcomes, is encouraging and further underscores the usefulness of employing subjective data to understand decision-making.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…the data used in this research is from a special module added to the Survey of Consumer Expectations, an original monthly survey fielded by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…this data source is a nationally representative, internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,200 household heads; respondents participate in the panel for up to twelve months, with a roughly equal number rotating in and out of the panel each month.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…this monthly survey is conducted over the internet by the Demand Institute, a non-profit organization jointly operated by The Conference Board and Nielsen.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…the sampling frame for the Survey of Consumer Expectations is based on that used for the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Survey. Respondents to the Consumer Confidence Survey, itself based on a representative national sample drawn from mailing addresses, are invited to join the Survey of Consumer Expenditures internet panel. Each survey typically takes about fifteen minutes to complete. The response rate for first-time invitees hovers around 55%.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…in August 2013, repeat panelists (that is, those who had participated in the survey in the prior eleven months) were invited to participate in the special module. Out of a total sample of 1,289 household heads invited to participate in the survey, 1,029 did so, implying a response rate of 78.8%. The survey was fielded during August 1 through 31, 2013. Respondents received $15 for completing the survey.
157~D1~T1~Time Period~2013.0~…survey year in which the relevant Survey of Consumer Expectations survey was fielded during August 1 through 31.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…survey respondents were asked about the average earnings of current 40 year olds working full-time, with and without a degree (population earnings beliefs), the average annual total cost (including room, board, and tuition) of a 4-year public as well as private univeristy (population cost beliefs), their current earnings and their beliefs about current earnings in the counterfactual state of education (self earnings beliefs), the net cost of college attendance for themselves (or, for those without a college degree, their expected cost had they attended college), also asking college (non-college) respondents for their likelihood of attending college had net costs been higher (lower) than their perceived costs (self cost beliefs), the likelihood of their child attending college, and beliefs about the child's earnings at age 30 in the case of their child earning or nont earning a colleg degree.
157~L1~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…survey respondents were asked about the average earnings of current 40 year olds working full-time, with and without a college degree. These reports are refered to as population earnings beliefs.
157~L3~L3~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (Cost)~…survey respondents were asked about the average annual total cost (including room, board, and tuition) of a 4-year public as well as a private university. These reports are refered to as population costs beliefs.
157~L2~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~…survey respondents were asked about their current earnings and their beliefs about current earnings in the counterfactual state of education. These reports are refered to as self-earnings beliefs.
157~L4~L4~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (Cost)~"…survey respondents were asked about the net cost of college attendance for themselves (or, for those without a college degree, their expected cost had they attended college). Researchers also asked college (non-college) respondents for their likelihood of attending college had net costs been higher (lower) than their perceived costs. Researchers refer to these as ""self-cost"" beliefs."
157~L5~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…survey respondents with children in the age range 6 to 24 in their household were asked about the likelihood of their child attending college, and beliefs about the child's earnings at age 30 in the case of their child earning or not earnings a college degree.
157~D1, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Self Beliefs~…researchers make a distinction between self (child's) beliefs and population beliefs throughout the paper. It is self beliefs that affect individuals' decisions, but it is hard to assess the accuracy of self beliefs since, by definition, the counterfactual states are not observed for the individual (researchers do not, for example, observe earnings of college graduates were they not to obtain college degrees). Furthermore, individuals may have private information about themselves which may, for instance, justify self beliefs about their own earnings that are very different from population averages.
157~D1~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…researchers make a distinction between self (child's) beliefs and population beliefs throughout the paper. It is self beliefs that affect individuals' decisions, but it is hard to assess the accuracy of self beliefs since, by definition, the counterfactual states are not observed for the individual (researchers do not, for example, observe earnings of college graduates were they not to obtain college degrees).
157~D1~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…the advantage of eliciting population beliefs is that they reflect the individuals' present stock or knowledge, and researchers can directly assess their accuracy. Therefore, if individuals have biased population beliefs, population and self beliefs are casually linked, and decision-making is contingent on one's self beliefs, then information campaigns providing accurate information about population earnings and costs can affect self beliefs and (thus) decisions.
157~L5~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…in the first relationship example between perceived public information and self beliefs, the household head believes that earnings are the product of an individual's level of skill and the skill price per unit of skill. The household head is certain about her child's level of skill but uncertain about the skill prices. She uses the (perceived) average population earnings of college graduates (relative to non-college workers) to infer skill prices. If this individual underestimates true population college earnings (and, hence, underestimates skill prices), her beliefs about her child's relative college earnings would also be biased downward. In this example, self earnings beliefs and population earnings beliefs are positively linked, and had the individual been provided with accurate information about population earnings (which are higher than her ex ante beliefs), she would revise her beliefs about her child's college earnings upward.
157~L5~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…in the second relationship example between perceived public information and self beliefs, thehousehold head believes that earnings are based on an individual's level of skill relative to the population average skill. The household head is certain about the level of the child's skill but uncertain about the population average level of skill. She uses the (perceived) average population earnings of colleg graduates to infer the average level of skill of college graduates. If she underestimates true population college earnings ( and, hence, underestimates the average population skill level), she is overestimating her child's relative position int he population skill distribution. in this case, where earnings are based on the individual's relative skills, underestimation of population college earnings would lead the individual to overestimate beliefs about her child's college earnings (that is, the two are negatively linked). Providing accurate information about population beliefs in this case would lead the individual to revise her beliefs about her child's college earnings downwards.

This may partly reflect differential internet access and computer literacy across various demographics.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…to make the relevant sample representative of the population, researchers use rim target weighting to match the targets for income, education, age, and region in the population.

157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…population beliefs of non-college worker earnings were elicited as follows: ""Consider all non-college graduate individuals (that is, individuals without a Bachelor's degree) currently aged 40 who are working full time right now. What do you believe is the average amount that these workers currently earn per year, before taxes and other deductions?"" Population beliefs for college workers were elicited similarly."
157~L1~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~"…population beliefs of non-college worker earnings were elicited as follows: ""Consider all non-college graduate individuals (that is, individuals without a Bachelor's degree) currently aged 40 who are working full time right now. What do you believe is the average amount that these workers currently earn per year, before taxes and other deductions?"" Population beliefs for college workers were elicited similarly."
157~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Population RCE by Education and Income~…the average population college earnings belief in the relevant sample is $57,800. Researchers also see that college-educated and higher-income respondents report significantly higher beliefs than their counterparts.
157~D1~F15~Findings~Average Population Non-College Earnings Beliefs~…the average population non-college earnings belief in the relevant sample, reported in the second row, is $36,600. Higher-income respondents report significantly higher beliefs than their counterparts.
157~L1~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…defined as the ratio of the average population college earnings belief to the average population non-college earnings belief in the relevant Survey of Consumer Expectations sample.
157~D1~F16~Findings~Average Population Relative College Earnings Beliefs~…the mean population belief relative college earnings in the sample is 1.70; that is, on average, respondents believe that current 40 year old college-graduate workers earn 1.7 time more than non-college workers. The average population relative cost earnings is significantly higher for college-educated respondents than for non-college respondents (1.83 versus 1.63). There is no statistical difference in the population relative coollege earnings conditional on respondents' household income.
157~V2~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…one of the purposes of eliciting respondents' population beliefs is to gauge their accuracy compared to the true values.
157~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to gauge the accuracy of population earnings beliefs against true values, researchers use earnings information of 38 to 42 year old full-time workers from the 2012 Current Population Survey, pooling across the months. The data reveal that, in 2012, average earnings of full-time college-graduate workers were $75,353, while those of non-college workers were $41,210.
157~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Actual Earnings and Population Belief Earnings Accuracy~"…comparing actual earnings figures with population belief earnings figures, it is found that, on average, respondents underestimate earnings of college-graduate workers by about $17,000 (~23%), and those of non-college workers by about $4,500(~11%). Notably, every sub-group that is considered underestimates earnings of both college and non-college workers (the only exception being beliefs of higher-income respondents about non-college workers' earnings). Moreover, the gaps (between the true statistics and subjective beliefs) are generally larger for college-graduate workers' earnings."
157~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the actual population relative college earnings, based on the 2012 Current Popultion Survey data, is 1.83; in fact, the relative college earnings has been between 1.76 and 1.83 since 2000, suggesting little change in relative earnings of colleg workers over the last decade or so.
157~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Error in RCE~…this measure is calculated by subtracting the true population relative college earnings from the perceived population relative college earnings.
157~D1, D2~F18~Findings~Relative Underestimation of RCE~…on average, respondents underestimate the relative college earnings by 0.13 points, with larger average errors for non-college and higher-income respondents.
157~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Error in RCE~…since errors can be both positive and negative, a mean error close to zero may not indicate a homogeneous low level of error and, therefore, researchers report the absolute value of the error.
157~D1, D2~F19~Findings~Mean Absolute Error~…the large mean absolute error of 0.50 indicates that non-trivial numbers of respondents make both positive and negative errors. Furthermore, even though the average error was smaller for college-educated respondents, their absolute error is of the same magnitude as that of non-college respondents.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…regresses the population relative college earnings onto a set of demographic variables, such as age, gender, education, literacy, race, and presence of student loans and children in the household of the age range 6 to 17 and 18 to 24; the regressions also nclude three terms allowing for an interaction between income and education, regional demographic variables including the proportion of adults who are college-educated, the median income, and the presence of a flagship or elite university in the respondent's location.
157~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Income, Education~…three interaction terms allowing for the interaction between income and education with the excleded group being higher-income college-educated respondents.
157~D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Fraction of PUMA Graduates~…the rationale for including this covariate is that individuals' perceptions are likely to be based on their own experiences as well as on local information.
157~D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Average PUMA Income~…the rationale for including this covariate is that individuals' perceptions are likely to be based on their own experiences as well as on local information.
157~D4~V4~Variable~Flagship University County~…the rationale for including this covariate is that individuals' perceptions are likely to be based on their own experiences as well as on local information.
157~D4~V5~Variable~Elite University County~…the rationale for including this covariate is that individuals' perceptions are likely to be based on their own experiences as well as on local information.
157~D1, D2, D5~F20~Findings~High-Income, Non-College, PUMA and RCE~…on average, higher-income non-college respondents report a population relative college earnings that is 0.12 point lower than that of higher-income college respondents. Respondents who live in areas with higher proportion of college-educated adults also report a higher population RCE, all else equal.
157~D1, D2~F21~Findings~Income, Numeracy and Absolute Errors in Perceived Population RCE~…higher-income college-educated individuals and those with high-numeracy have smaller absolute errors, on average. Lower-income college-educated respondents have an average error in their perceived population RCE that is 0.43 points larger than that of higher-income college-educated individuals. This suggests that individuals' own experiences do cloud their perceptions: college-graduates who themselves receive lower returns (as proxied by their income) have less accurate perceptions of the average population RCE.
157~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Demographic Variable Explanation of Population RCE Results~…demographic variables in ordinary least-square regressions on the population relative college earnings can explain about 5% of the variation in cross-sectional heterogeneity in beliefs. 
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in later specifications of this model, researchers regress the absolute error in each of the components of the RCE (earnings for non-college workers and earnings for college workers) onto the same set of demographic variables.
157~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Income, Numeracy, and Population RCE~…higher-income college educated respondents as well as high-numeracy respondents, on average, have smaller absolute errors in their population earnings beliefs of both non-college and college workers. On the other hand, lower-income college-educated respondents, on average, have larger absolute errors, averageing $5,350 higher absolute error in non-college workers' earnings and $8,920 higher absolute error in college-educated workers' earnings (compared to higher-income non-college respondents). It is also clear that lower-income non-college respondents have significantly larger absolute errors in their perceptions of college workers' earnings.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…when eliciting responses for the respondent's beliefs about college costs for public and private universities, the survey question asked: ""What is your best guess of the current annual total cost (including tuition, room, and board) of a 4-year Bachelor's degree at a [public/private] university?"""
157~D1~F24~Findings~Average Perceived Population College Cost~…on average, respondents beliefs that the average annual total cost (including room, board, and tuition) of a 4-year Bachelor's degree at a public university is $29,100, while at a private university is $40,000. The average beliefs across the different sub-groups are similar, and do not significantly differ by either respondents' income or education level; however, the large standard errors indicate substantial heterogeneity in beliefs in the sample (and within each sub-group).
157~D3~D3~Dataset~Annual Survey of Colleges~…according to analysis by the College Board, the average annual net cost (including tuition, fees, room, and board) at a 4-year public university was $12,400 for the 2012-2013 school year, while the average annual sticker price was $18,170. Similarly, the average annual net cost at a 4-year private university was $22,590 for the 2012-2013 school year and the average annual sticker price was $40,220.
157~D1~F25~Findings~Average Perceived Public College Cost~...the average belief in the sample is significantly higher than either the average net or sticker public cost: the average error in costs (defined as perceived minust true costs) of public schools, assuming respondents report sticker (net) costs, is $10,900 (16,700); this corresponds to an overestimation of public college costs by 60% (135%).
157~D1~F26~Findings~Average Perceived Private College cost~…the average private school cost reported by the relevant sample is quite close to the 4-year private university annual sticker price, but significantly higher than the net price. The absolute average error is substantial, varying between $13,600 and $18,900, depending on the measure one looks at. Notably, it is found that college-educated and higher-income respondents make smaller absolute errors than their counterparts (the differences are statistically significant at conventional levels in six of the eight pairwise comparisons).
157~D3, D4~V8~Variable~Net Cost~…the total perceived cost of attending college with the deduction of scholarships, financial aid, etc.
157~D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Sticker Costs~…sticker costs are the published and publicized total costs of attending a university.
157~D3, D4~V8~Variable~Net Cost~…due to fvarious financial aid programs, based on need and merit, may students net costs are below their respective university's sticker cost.
157~D3, D4~V8~Variable~Net Cost~…the net cost depends on several factors, such as the household income distribution of incoming students.
157~D1, D3, D4~F27~Findings~Point Forecast and Sticker Public University Cost~…the point forecast of 77% (86%) of respondents is above the sticker (net) public university cost.
157~V2~L3~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (Cost)~…when individuals are asked about college costs, many tend to gravitate toward sticker costs rather than net costs.
157~D1, D3, D4~F28~Findings~Public University Cost Overestimation~…12.5% of respondents report public university annual costs exceeding $40,000, when in fact only one public institution in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series sample has a sticker price in that range.
157~D1, D3, D4~F29~Findings~Private University Cost Overestimation~…in the case of private universities, most of the responses are above the net private university cost, with 38% (86%) of responses above the sticker (net) private university cost.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F30~Findings~Propensity to Overestimate by Income and Education Subgroup~…there is little difference across the sub-groups in their propensity to overestimate costs (the exception being higher-income and college-educated respondents whose responses regarding averaging public university costs are more likely to exceed actual average net prices).
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to investigate how the heterogeneity in accuracy of perceived college costs correlates with individual characteristics, researchers regress the absolute error in net and sticker public and then private university costs onto a set of demographic variables. For this exercise, researchers use the statistics on actual average 2012-2013 college costs from the College Board.
157~D1, D3, D4~F31~Findings~Child Has Attended and Information~…respondents with a child who has attended college - perhaps as a result of their recent experiences with the United States higher educational system - have significantly smaller errors with their absolute error using public net costs is, on average, $12,400 smaller than their counterparts with a child aged 18 to 24 years who has not attended college.
157~D1, D3, D4~F32~Findings~Flagship University County and Information~…respondents who live in counties containing flagship public universities, on average, make smaller errors in public school costs (which are not precisely estimated), while respondents who live in counties containing 'elite' universities make signfiicantly smaller errors in private school costs.
157~D4~V5~Variable~Elite University County~…73% of these universities are private.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F33~Findings~Lower Income Households and Information ~…researchers find that lower-income non-college respondents - arguably household heads that are most disadvantaged - tend to make larger absolute errors; for example, their average absolute error using net costs for private universities is $21,400, compared to $17,300 for their counterparts (difference statistically significant; p-value=0.026). Lower-income no-college respondents also have a higher average absolute error in public net college costs, $19,300 versus $16,500 (p-value=0.072).
157~V2~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…benchmarked against actual population RCE in the respondent's PUMA, using data from the 2012 American Community Survey.
157~D6~D6~Dataset~American Community Survey~…source of data on actual population RCE in each relevant Public Use Microeconomic Area.
157~V2~L3~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (Cost)~…benchmarked against a weighted average of 2012 sticker college costs in the respondent's state of residence, obtained from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.
157~D1, D2~F34~Findings~Average Local Absolute Error in the Population RCE~…the average local absolute error in the population RCE is 0.49 points (compared to an average population RCE using the national statistics of 0.50.
157~D1, D3, D4~F35~Findings~Average Local Absolute Error in Public University Sticker Costs~...the average local absolute error in public university sticker costs is $12,300 (compared to $13,900) and for private university sticker costs is $14,800 (comared to $13,600).
157~D1~F36~Findings~Accuracy of Estimation of Local and National RCE~…only 54% of respondents underestimate the local RCE, compared to 74% underestimating the national RCE, and 50% (38%) of respondents overestimate local public (private) university sticker costs (versus 77% (38%) for national public (private) unversity sticker costs), suggesting that geographic variation in these measures is one factor that explains the cross-sectional heterogeneity in population beliefs.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…researchers asked survey respondents about their current earnings, as well as their counterfactual earnings; for example, for individuals with less than a Bachelor's degree, researchers asked them about what they belief their earnings would have been in the counterfactual case where they had a Bachelor's degree: ""Roughly speaking, what do you think your annual earnings would be, before taxes and other deduction, IF you had a Bachelor's Degree?"" For those with a Bachelor's, researchers elicit the counterfactual earnings as follows: ""Roughly speaking, what do you think your annual earnings would be, before taxes and other deductions, IF you only had a high school diploma?"""
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~"…researchers asked survey respondents about their current earnings, as well as their counterfactual earnings; for example, for individuals with less than a Bachelor's degree, researchers asked them about what they belief their earnings would have been in the counterfactual case where they had a Bachelor's degree: ""Roughly speaking, what do you think your annual earnings would be, before taxes and other deduction, IF you had a Bachelor's Degree?"" For those with a Bachelor's, researchers elicit the counterfactual earnings as follows: ""Roughly speaking, what do you think your annual earnings would be, before taxes and other deductions, IF you only had a high school diploma?"""
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~…for each respondent, using their actual earnings andf those in the counterfactual state, researchers construct their self RCE.
157~D1~F37~Findings~Average Self RCE~…the average self RCE in the sample is 1.95, that is, individuals believe that earnings with (at least) a Bachelor's degree would be almost twice as high as without one.
157~D1, D2~F38~Findings~Average Self RCE by Education Level~…the average self RCE is lower for non-college respondents (1.9 versus 2.1 for college-educated respondents), but higher for lower-income respondents (2.1 versus 1.8 for higher-income respondents), though the differences are not statistically significant.
157~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Self Beliefs (RCE)~…this measure is, on average, substantially lower for lower-income college-graduates respondents (relative to higher-income college-graduate respondents).
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"….college-educated survey respondents were asked for their annual net college costs (total net cost, including room, board, and tuition); the question was ""What were your annual total net costs when you attended college (total net costs means total college costs including tution, room, and board, MINUS any grants and scholarships you think you could have obtained)?"""
157~D3, D4~V9~Variable~Actual College Costs~…the actual cost of college for college-educated respondents of the Survey of Consumer Expectations.
157~D3, D4~V8~Variable~Net Cost~…includes tuition, room, and board, minus any grants and scholarships obtained by the respondent.
157~D1, D3, D4~F39~Findings~Average Annual Net Cost Among Survey of Consumer Expectations Respondents~…for the 582 Survey of Consumer Expectations respondents who have a college degree, their average annual net cost was $14,900, though the standard deviation is high ($14,800).
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…non-college respondents were asked how much they believed college would have cost (total net cost), had they chosen to attend college; the question was: ""You chose not to pursue a 4-year Bachelor's degree. If you had chosen to pursue a Bachelor's degree what do you believe annual total net costs of the degree would have been (total net costs means total college costs including tuition, room, and board, MINUS any grants and scholarships you think you could have obtained)?"""
157~D1~V10~Variable~Perceived College Costs~…the perceived cost of college for non-college respondents of the Survey of Consumer Expectations.
157~D1~F40~Findings~Mean Expected Personal Cost of College~…the mean expected personal cost of college is $28,400, which is almost double the cost that college-educated respondents actually paid for their degree. Note that researchers do not interpret this as evidence for a causal relationship between self costs and college attendance; one possible explanation for this systematic pattern of non-college respondents reporting higher average college costs is that they are providing answers that rationalize their past actions. For example, a non-college respondent may attempt to rationalize her decision of not getting a college degree by reporting that the college costs for her would have been relatively high.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers use this estimation method to regress the self costs (pooling the actual and perceived costs) onto 
157~D1~F41~Findings~Bias for College Respondents of the Survey of Consumer Expectations~…college-educated respondents report significantly lower costs, reflecting the upward-biased perceptions of non-college respondents about college costs (that persist even after including a rich set of demographic controls).
157~D1, D2~F42~Findings~Linear Age Term~…the linear age term has a negative coefficient and the quadratic age term has a positive coefficient, suggesting increasingly rising (perceived) college costs (consistent with constant long-term inflation in college costs).
157~D1~F43~Findings~Self Cost Beliefs and Population Cost Beliefs~…respondent's reported self cost beliefs are positively correlated with their population cost beliefs. The coefficient on population public costs, indicates a correlation of 0.30 between the two beliefs.
157~D1~V2~Variable~Population Beliefs~…population beliefs, the way they are elicited in this research, should be reasonable proxies of the current stock of knowledge of respondents (furthermore, they are elicited before respondents are asked about self beliefs).
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…survey respondents were asked about the likelihood of their child attending college, as well as the child's earnings at age 30 if the child had a Bachelor's degree, and if the child had a high school diploma only. These questions were asked as follows: ""Look ahead to when this child will be 30 years old, and working full time. What do you think he/she will be earnings annually, before taxes and other deductions, if he/she had a Bachelor's Degree? And, what do you think he/she will be earning annually, before taxes and other deductions, if he/she had a high school diploma only."
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~"…survey respondents were asked about the likelihood of their child attending college, as well as the child's earnings at age 30 if the child had a Bachelor's degree, and if the child had a high school diploma only. These questions were asked as follows: ""Look ahead to when this child will be 30 years old, and working full time. What do you think he/she will be earnings annually, before taxes and other deductions, if he/she had a Bachelor's Degree? And, what do you think he/she will be earning annually, before taxes and other deductions, if he/she had a high school diploma only. In the relevant sample, 238 respondents reported beliefs for a pre-college age child."
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…these beliefs were elicted for the oldest child in the household in the 6 to 17 age range (that is, pre-college age child). In the relevant sample, 238 respondents reported belief for a pre-college age child.
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…respondents were also asked about their beliefs for their oldest child in the age range 18 to 24 as well. A total of 142 respondents reported a child in this age range, and provided belief data for the child. However, the eventual goal is to see how respondents' current stock of knowledge affects their intended future actions for their pre-college age child. Since the decision of enrolling in college has already been made for these older childre, researchers exclude them from the analysis. As in the case of self own beliefs, self beliefs for these older children could be biased if respondents wanted to rationalize the course of action taken for their child- for example, an individual whose child (in the 18-24 age range) chooses not to enroll in college may report lower relative college returns for their child in order to rationalize the decision of not attending college. Therefore, excluding them seems the appropriate course of action.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…respondents were also asked about their beliefs for their oldest child in the age range 18 to 24 as well. A total of 142 respondents reported a child in this age range, and provided belief data for the child. However, the eventual goal is to see how respondents' current stock of knowledge affects their intended future actions for their pre-college age child.

Therefore, excluding them seems the appropriate course of action.
157~D1~F8~Findings~Mean Probability of College Attendance~…the mean probability that the child will attend college is 77.8%, with substantial heterogeneity in the belief (a standard deviation of 28 points).
157~D1, D2~F44~Findings~Parental Education Level, Income, and Likelihood of College Attendance~…notably, researchers find that pre-college age children of college-educated respondents have a significantly higher average likelihood of attending college (90% versus 71% for non-colllege respondents). Likewise, higher-income respondents report a significantly higher mean likelihood of their child attending college (85% versus 66% for their lower-income counterparts). These differences are statistically significant at the 1% level.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…researchers claim only that intended actions and expectations be causallly relevant for future actions, rather than a mirror of actual future actions.
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…from respondents' responses about their child's future earnings at age 30, with and without a college degree, researchers can construct the child's relative college earnings.
157~D1, D2~F45~Findings~Mean Child's RCE vs. Average Perceived Population RCE~…the mean child RCE is 2.2 in the sample, higher than respondents' average perceived population RCE (1.7), which suggests that the relevant survey respondentsts either expect the relative returns to a college degree to increase over time or expect their child's relative earnings to be higher than those for an average individual in the population.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…when asking respondents about the likelihood of their child attending college, the question asks: ""Consider the oldest child in your household with an age between 6 to 17. What is the percent change that this child will attend college?"""
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~"…when asking respondents about the likelihood of their child attending college, the question asks: ""Consider the oldest child in your household with an age between 6 to 17. What is the percent change that this child will attend college?"""
157~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Information Set~…the individual's information set may contain both self (private) information, such as the individual's perceived ability of their child, and population information, such as the individual's perception of average relative earnings for workers with a college education.
157~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Information Set~…note that researchers allow for the possibility that respondents' perceptions about the population distribution could be different from the actual measures. Hence, the information set about the population distribution of earnings could vary over time and across individuals.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers first estimate a function mapping the individual's demographic characteristics and information set to self beliefs as a linear function of the respondent's characteristics, using the same set of variables used to explain heterogeneity in population and self own beliefs above.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F46~Findings~Demographic Variable Explanation of Child's RCE Results~…demographic variables can explain about 29% of the variation in the child's RCE.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in order to test if individual's expectations of their child's RCE depends in some way on their perceived population RCE by regressing the child's RCE onto a set of demographic controls, as well as onto the perceived population RCE.
157~D1~F47~Findings~Population RCE and Child's RCE~…the estimate on the population RCE indicates that perceived population RCE is economically and statistically significant related to beliefs about the child's RCE. A 0.2 increase in beliefs about the population RCE (that is, the average amount by which the relevant sample underestimates the population RCE) increases beliefs about child's RCE by 0.1 points. This suggests that the perceived population RCE for an individual is an element of the individual's information set, which is used to form expectations about the child's RCE.
157~D1~F48~Findings~R-Squared in Child's RCE Regression~…the R-Squared on regression of the child's RCE onto demographic controls and the perceived population RCE indicates that now almost 40% of the variation in child's RCE can be explained by the perceived population RCE and demogarphic characteristics. This suggests that individuals' beliefs of their child's future relative college earnings do, in part, depend on their perceptions of current relative returns to a college degree for the general population.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…a respondent's reported likelihood at a certain time of their child's college attendance is a function of the repsondent's information set and a vector of demographic characteristics. As before, the information set may contain private information about the child, such as the expected returns to a college education for the child (that is, the child's RCE), as well as population information, such as the perceived costs of a college education.
157~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Information Set~…may contain private information about the child, such as the expected returns to a college education for the child (that is, the child's RCE), as well as population information, such as the perceived costs of a college education.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methdology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…estimates a linear function of the correlates of the child's college attendance likelihood. The first specification includes only demographic variables, the second including the addition of a quadratic of the child's perceived RCE, and the perceived public university cost (in $1,000s) interacted with lower income, the third including the addition of the perceived population RCE as an additional covariate, and the fourth including responses of household heads for their 18 to 24 year old children in the analysis. The dependent variable is the intended college likelihood for the pre-college age (6 to 17 years old) children appended to the actual college enrollment decision - coded as zero for non-enrollees and 100 for enrollees - for the older children.
157~D1~F49~Findings~College Attendance and Child's RCE~…the estimates imply that college attendance increases as respondents' expected child's relative college earnings increase up to about 2.75 (the 85th percentile) and decreases as the RCE increases further. This model confirms the hypothesis that parents with higher expected college returns for their children are substantially more likely to intend to send their children to college: increasing the child's RCE from 1.7 to 1.83 (that is, from the average perceived population RCE to the actual present population RCE) increases the intended likelihood of the child attending college by almost 2.5 percentage points.
157~D1, D3, D4~F50~Findings~Marginal Impact of Costs~…the impact of costs is, surprisingly, marginally positive but small in economic terms: a $1,000 increase in average perceived college costs increases the intended likelihood of the child from a higher- (lower-) income household attending college by 0.29 (0.09) percentage points.
157~D1~F51~Findings~Population RCE and Likelihood of College Attendance~…the estimate on the population RCE is positive but not statistically different from zero, suggesting that the perceived population RCE is not directly related to the intended liklihood of the child attending college.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F52~Findings~Demographics, Child's RCE, College Cost, and Likelihood of College Attendance~…overall findings from regressions on the likelihood of future attendance include that the child's expected RCE is a significant predictor of the intended likelihood of the child's college attendance, costs are not significant predictors of the intended likelihood, and demographic differences in college attendance (by education of the parents) generally persists even after controlling for the perceived benefits and costs of college attendance.
157~D1, D3, D4~F53~Findings~Interaction Term of College Costs and Lower-Income Households Estimate~…while other estimates are qualitatively similar, it is clear that the interaction term of college costs with lower-income houesholds continues to be negative, but is larger in magnitude and significant at the 10% level. The estimate is still economically small, however: a $1,000 increase in perceived population costs decreases the likelihood of the child's college attendance by 0.3 points. Nevertheless, this stronger relationship between college attendance and college costs - for lower-income households - is consistent with lower-income household heads discounting future costs at a higher rate than they discount future payoffs when reporting their intended plans.
157~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Quadratic of Perceived RCE~…a quadratic of the child's perceived RCE as included in linear regressions on the likelihood of college attendance.
157~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Perceived Public University Cost, Lower Income~…the perceived public university cost (in $1,000s) interacted with lower-income as included in linear regressions on the likelihood of college attendance.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…researchers believe it is reasonable to assume that one's perceived child's RCE is plausibly exogenous to the perceived likelihood of their child's attending college, and that the current stock of knowledge is casually affecting the intended likelihood of future actions; however, it cannot be ruled out that parents decide whether their child is going to attend college or not at very young ages. If this were the case, then reverse causality would be an issue. That is, parents may then report their child's RCE to justify the decision. For precisely this reason, researchers exclude responses for children aged 18-24 from the main analysis, since the decision for them has been made and is, to a large extent, irreversible.
157~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Child Beliefs (RCE)~…researchers believe it is reasonable to assume that one's perceived child's RCE is plausibly exogenous to the perceived likelihood of their child's attending college, and that the current stock of knowledge is casually affecting the intended likelihood of future actions; however, it cannot be ruled out that parents decide whether their child is going to attend college or not at very young ages. If this were the case, then reverse causality would be an issue. That is, parents may then report their child's RCE to justify the decision. For precisely this reason, researchers exclude responses for children aged 18-24 from the main analysis, since the decision for them has been made and is, to a large extent, irreversible.
157~D1~F54~Findings~Perceived Population RCE, Self RCE and Child's RCE~…individuals who underestimate the population RCE by, say, 0.1 points report a child's RCE that is 0.05 points lower. That is, the systematic underestimation of the population RCE - which is more prevalent among lower-income and non-college respondents - leads to lower perceived relative returns to a college degree for the child.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…information intervention that successfully provides accurate information to individuals about the earnings of college and non-collefge workers would have a causal impact on individuals' intended choices, tending on average to increase the likelihood of children's college attendance.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Revised Likelihood of Future Attendance~…this measure of likelihood of future attendance simulates a scenario in which individuals are given correct information about the population earnings of college and non-college workers. The respondents' perceived child's RCE post-information is obtained using an estimated linear function on demographics and actual population RCE. This provides an estimate of each respondent's perceived child's RCE were they to have accurate population beliefs. A linear estimation is estimated replacing the child's RCE with a first-stage estimate of the child's RCE. Given the model specifications, this yields the revised likelihood of the respondent's child's college attendance, were they to be provided with accurate information about population earnings.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…used to estimate the likelihood of attending college under an accurate information simulation scenarios. To account for the sequential nature of the simulation, in which researchers first estimate perceived child's RCE and then the intended college attendance likelihood, researchers report bootstrapped standard errors for the revised likelihood estimates.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F55~Findings~Revised Likelihood of Future Attendance Estimates~…when linear regressions of the likelihood of attending college under an accurate information simulation, the average likelihood of the child attending college increases from 78% to 83%, a statistically significant difference.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F56~Findings~Revised Likelihood of Future Attendance and Mean Intended Likelihood~…when linear regressions of the likelihood of attending college under an accurate information simulation, increases in the mean likelihood occur for each group, with larger and statistically significant increases for non-college and lower-income household heads (this is partly because these groups are more likely to underestimate the population RCE). For example, the mean intended likelihood of lower-income individuals' children attending college jums from 66% to 76% (the impact is statistically different from zero at the 5% level).
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F57~Findings~Revised Likelihood of Future Attendance, Education, Income and College Attendance Gap~…when linear regressions of the likelihood of attending college under an accurate information simulation, another notable features is that the gap in intended college attendance by parents' education or income persists but decreases substantially. For example, the college-attendance gap by income decreases from 18.5 percentage points to 11 points. Overall, this suggests that simple information campaigns that provide true information about the returns to a college degree can have substantial impacts on intended college attendance, and can also reduce the gaps across groups.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…for the first check to validate the robustness of results, researchers estimate the models for each of the 4 sub-groups (non-college; college; lower-income; higher-income), separately. This allows for the possibility that the function mapping the individual's covariates onto his perceived child's RCE, as well as the function that maps the individual's covariates onto the intended likelihood of the child attending college, may differ for each of these sub-groups.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Revised Likelihood of Future Attendance~…reseachers estimate functions mapping the individual's covariates, as well as the function that maps the individual's covariates onto the intended likelihood of the child attending college, with the assumption of accurate information to derive the revised likelihood of the respondents' children's college attendance, were they to be provided with accurate information about population earnings.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~…for the second check, researchers estimate the model with instrumentation for the respondent's perceived child's RCE by the respondent's perceived population RCE. The identifying assumption here is that the population RCE belief only affects the intended likelihood of the child's college attendance through the perceived child's RCE. The imprecises estimate on the population RCE belief when it is included in the college likelihood model gives credence to this assumption. Researchers estimate the model on likelihood of college attendance ommiting the squared child's RCE, since there is only one instrument for the child's RCE.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~…this second-check model is estimated using two-stage least squares with a strong first stage given the relationship that is documented between perceptions of the child's RCE and population RCE.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~…this estimation method is used to simulate the scenario of providing respondents with accurate information about population earnings.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~…for the purpose of this experience, researchers truncate the sample at a perceived child's RCE of 3, in order to capture the positively-related portion of the quadratic relationship between perceived child's RCE and perceived likelihood of college attendance. This excludes 13% of the relevant sample.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~"…researchers asked non-college respondents for the likelihood that they would not have attended college had the cost been 80% or 50% as high as they expected it to be, and asked college-educated respondents for the likelihood that they would have attended college had it cost 120% or 140% of the cost they actuall incurred. The question was asked as follows: ""Consider the case where annual total net costs of a 4-year Bachelor's were $[(0.8) * expected cost of college, where expectedcost of college is what the respondent reports the annual net cost of college for them actually was, or would have been]. What is the percent change that you would have attended college to obtain a 4-year Bachelor's degree."
157~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Past Attendance~"…researchers asked non-college respondents for the likelihood that they would not have attended college had the cost been 80% or 50% as high as they expected it to be, and asked college-educated respondents for the likelihood that they would have attended college had it cost 120% or 140% of the cost they actuall incurred. The question was asked as follows: ""Consider the case where annual total net costs of a 4-year Bachelor's were $[(0.8) * expected cost of college, where expectedcost of college is what the respondent reports the annual net cost of college for them actually was, or would have been]. What is the percent change that you would have attended college to obtain a 4-year Bachelor's degree."
157~D1~F58~Findings~Elasticity of Past Attendance for Non-College Respondents~…the mean likelihood of non-college respondents having attended college is 22% had net college costs been 80% of their expected cost, and 37% had college cost only half as much as they expected it to. The large standard deviations in the likelihood of college attendance (27% and 35%, respectively) indicate substantial heterogeneity in sensitivity to college costs.
157~D1~F59~Findings~Inelasticity of Past Attendance for Non-College Respondents~…several respondents' decision of not enrolling is not sensitive to the change in perceived tuition: 34.3% (23.6%) of non-college respondents would still have certainly not enrolled in college had net costs been only 80% (50%) as high.
157~D1~F60~Findings~Elasticity of Past Attendance for College Respondents~…the average likelihood of college-educated respondents attending college would have been 87% had costs been 1.2 times as high, and 82% had college costs been 1.4 times as high. Again, the response is quite heterogeneous, with 58.8% (48.7%) of college-educated respondents reporting that they would have attended college with certainty had college costs been 20% (40%) higher.
157~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Past Attendance~…using the responses to hypothetical cost scenarios, resaerchers can calculate respondents' elasticity of college attendance, which measures the responsiveness of the probability that an individual attends college to changes in net costs.
157~DV21~L12~Variable Value~Non-College College Attendance Elasticity~…the elasticity of college attendance for non-college respondents is calculated as the ratio of the percent change in the probability of attending college in the two cases to the percent change in the net cost of college.
157~D1~F61~Findings~Mean Elasticity for Non-College Respondents~…the mean elasticity for non-college respondents -1.9. This is a fairly elastic response, implying a 19% increase in the likelihood of college attendance for a 10% decrease in college costs. As one may expect, lower-income household heads are more responsive to college costs (an average elasticity of -2.1 versus -1.8 for their higher-income counterparts), though the difference is not statistically significant.
157~DV21~L12~Variable Value~Non-College College Attendance Elasticity~...it is found that the intended college likelihood of 198 of the 417 non-college respondents is zero, that is, it is insensitive to changes in college costs; in addition, researchers are unable to estimate elasticities for 57 respondents.
157~DV21~DV21~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Past Attendance~…researchers calculate the elasticitiy using only the counterfactual responses becauses they do not observe the likelihood that a college-educated respondent would have attended college at the price at which they actually attended college (or, for no-college respondents, at their expected college cost), instead only observing whether or not they attended college at the (actual or perceived) cost.
157~DV21~DV21~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Past Attendance~…there are three circumstances in which respondents' elasticity cannot be calculated. First, 13 respondents chose to not respond to one of the counterfactual cost questions. Second, 44 no-college respondents claimed a 0% chance of college attendance at 80% of their expected cost but a positive chance of college attendance at 50% of their attendance cost, which implies an infinite elasticity. Third, 16 respondents claimed that their prosepective or actual college cost was 0 dollars, which prevented the formulation of counterfactual scenarios.
157~D1~F62~Findings~Mean Elasticity for College Respondents~…for college-educated respondents, the average elasticity of college attendance is -0.6. While the response is inelastic, it still indicates modest sensitivity to changes in (perceived) college costs.
157~D1~L10~Variable Value~College Grad College Attendance Elasticity~…nearly half, 288 of the 568, of respondents are insensitive to college costs in their likelihood of attending college.
157~D1~F63~Findings~Average Elasticity to College Costs for Lower Income Households~…researchers find a greater sensitivity to college costs for lower-income households: their average elasticity is -0.8 versus -0.5 for their counterparts (difference not statistically significant).
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F64~Findings~Underestimation of Net Benefits of a College Diploma Among Respondents~…household heads, on average, underestimate the returns to a college degree for an average person in the population and report college costs that exceed even average sticker costs. That is, households, on average, underestimate net benefits and overestimate net costs of a college degree. Since it is found that individuals' perceived returns of a college education for their (pre-college age) child are positively related with their perceived average population returns to a college degree, and individuals' perceived college returns for their child are a strong predictor of the intended likelihood of the child attending college, these biases in perceived college costs and benefits adversely impact the child's intended college attendance.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Future Attendance~…it is important to note that this measure is determined by the head of household and not the child of interest.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F65~Findings~Intended Likelihood of Attendance~…researchers find that the intended likelihood of the child's college attedance rises in the sample; the magitude of the increases is as large as a 0.2 standard deviation increase in the baseline college attendance probability.
157~D1~F66~Findings~Information Gaps Among Disadvantaged households~…importantly, researchers find that information gaps are larger for more disadvantaged households, but that disadvantaged households gain more from simulated information interventions; as a result, the socioeconomic gradient in child's intended college attendance shrinks substantially.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the simulations in this research are based on the model specifications adopted for the purposes of analysis, and assume a homogenous and rational form of updating. The actual response to information could be quite heterogenous, either because individuals use individual-specific updating rules, or because of various behavioral factors that may impact information-processing. 
157~D1~L12~Variable Value~Non-College College Attendance Elasticity~…because researchers are asking respondents for their prospective college costs many years after they made their own college attendance decisions (of not to attend college), it is likely that their responses systematically differ from the beliefs that they held prior to making their decision, say, due to ex post rationalization. For example, individuals who decided not to attend college may overestimate their prospective costs in order to justify their decision. Moreover, the actual cost of college these individuals would have faced had they chose to attend college is not know.
157~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Expectations~…this data proxies individual's overestimation of their own college cost with their current overestimation of the population average public.
157~D1, D3, D4~DV22~Derived Variable~Overestimation~…proxies individuals' overestimation of their own college cost with their current overestimation of the population average public sticker cost. This implicitly assumes that the current error in respondents' perceived college costs is a good proxy for their stock of knowledge regarding college costs at the time of the respondent's decision of not attending college.
157~D1, D2, D3, D4~F67~Findings~Elasticities in the Likelihood of College Attendance by Income Level~…it is found that calculated elasticities imply an average increase in the likelihood of college attendance of 34.5%, although the standard deviation is very high, suggesting substantial heterogeneity. The likelihood of college attendance rises more for higher-income individuals than lower-income individuals, though the difference is not statistically significant, and even lower-income individuals' likelihood of college attendance rises by about 30%.
157~V3~L11~Variable Value~Low Income~…households with an annual income of less than or equal to $50,000.
157~V1~L7~Variable Value~Non-College~…refers to households where the household head does not have a four-year college degree.
157~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Absolute Error in Earnings~…absolute error in average earnings defined as the absolute value of reported earnings minus actual earnings.
157~V2~L1~Variable Value~Population Beliefs (RCE)~…the absolute difference between the respondent's reported Population RCE and the actual population RCE in the respondent's Public Use Microeconomic Area.
157~DV10~L13~Variable Value~Public Uni. Sticker Cost~…the absolute difference between the respondent's reported sticker colege cost and the actual weighted average college cost in the respondent's state, in '000 s of dollars.
158~158: Internal Migration in the United States~~~~
158~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…although the Current Population Survey and ACS are based on similar sample designs and the same survey equestion, certain methodological differences between the CPS and ACS could potentially contribute to the disparity. For example, while both sampling frames are drawn from the 2000 Census, the ACS uses postal addresses to update the sampling frame whereas the CPS uses building permits. Another methodological difference is that the ACS revisits vacant housing units for up to three months in order to collect data, whereas the CPS records a housing unit as vacant after the first visit.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…because researchers are unable to explain the divergence in migration rates between the Current Population Survey and other data sources, it is difficult to determine which source presents a more accurate picture of migration in the past five years. Researchers lean towards the IRS and ACS estimates, partly because they are based on larger samples, and partly because other datasets that have been examined, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Survey of Income and Program Participation.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…in 1990 and 2000 Census publicly available microdata, researchers can identify migration across PUMAs
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…in the Census and ACS, an individual's current and previous MSA can only be identified if both are large enough to satisfy confidentiality restrictions. Because of these limitations, state and county lines are often used to approximate local labor markets.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…in the decennial Census, researchers can also construct an approximation of lifetime migration going back to 1850 by comparing current state of residence to an individual's birth state.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…lifetime and 5-year migration rates are from the decennial Census 1900-2000 and from the ACS for 2009.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the American Community Survey data in all figures and analyses are based on microdata rather than published tables, in order to exclude individuals in group quarters or with imputed migration data. The group quarters exclusion matters for the ACS because prior to 2006 the ACS did not cover individuals in group quarters, who have a higher propensity to migrate than other individuals.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the American Community Survey data suggests that migration has fallen, but the magnitude ofthis decline is much more modest.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the American Community Survey started in 2000 and reports similar data to the decennial Census for an annual frequency, but it only covers all of the United States for the period since 2005.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the estimated levels of migration in the IRS and ACS are similar to one another (which is somewhat surprising because the sources and methodology on which they are based  are quite different) and were more than 50% higher than the Current Population Survey estimates in 2008, the latest year for which all three datsets are available.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…the U.S. Census one of three main sources for constructing United States migration rates which has produced decennial data since 1970 and recently began producing annual data in the form of the American Community Survey (ACS).
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…this data source provides the greatest flexibility in defining migrants. For most years and samples since 1940, researchers can observe whether an individual is currently residing in a different state or county than five years ago, as well as the exact state of residence in those two periods. Beginning in 1980, researchers can also observe the current metropolitan area and the metropolitan area of residence 5 years ago for individuals living in cities in both periods.
158~D1~D1~Dataset~Census~…using publicly available Census microdata, in 1980 commuting zones can be determined by county of residence, and in 1990 and 2000, commuting zones can be determined by PUMA.
158~D10~D10~Dataset~Statistics Canada~…in Canada, interprovincial mobility was mostly flat from 2000 to 2008 and stepped up in 2008, and it remained substantially below United States inter-state migration throughout the 2000s.
158~D10~D10~Dataset~Statistics Canada~…researchers have examined Canadian cross-province mobility provided by statistics Canada.
158~D11~D11~Dataset~British Office for National Statistics~…in the U.K. data, the populations of the nine regions range from 2.5 to 8 million: for comparison, the population of the median state in the 2000 US census was 4 million.
158~D11~D11~Dataset~British Office for National Statistics~…researchers have examined mobility between nine regions in England from the British Office for National Statistics.
158~D12~D12~Dataset~National Association of Realtors~…source of house sales data.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all demographic and economic characteristic calculations are from Current Population Survey microdata, excluding residents of group quarters and imputed migration values.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all regression control variables are calculated from the Current Population Survey.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…although the Current Population Survey and ACS are based on similar sample designs and the same survey equestion, certain methodological differences between the CPS and ACS could potentially contribute to the disparity. For example, while both sampling frames are drawn from the 2000 Census, the ACS uses postal addresses to update the sampling frame whereas the CPS uses building permits. Another methodological difference is that the ACS revisits vacant housing units for up to three months in order to collect data, whereas the CPS records a housing unit as vacant after the first visit.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…although the population of tax filers is not necessarily representative of non-filers, according to the Current Population Survey, 87% of household heads filed tax returns between 1992 and 2009 (the years for which this information is available) and the fraction of filers did not change during this period.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…annual migration rates are calculated from Current Population Survey microdata
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…because researchers are unable to explain the divergence in migration rates between the Current Population Survey and other data sources, it is difficult to determine which source presents a more accurate picture of migration in the past five years. Researchers lean towards the IRS and ACS estimates, partly because they are based on larger samples, and partly because other datasets that have been examined, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Survey of Income and Program Participation.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from this source is used for analysis on the cross-state migration rates across demographic and socioeconomic groups.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data on nativity is only available in this source from 1994 onwards.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…it should be noted that employment status and home ownership are only recorded in the Current Population Survey for the current year.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…migration rates based on the Current Population Survey microdata go back to 1965 and can be extended back to 1948 using published tables.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…one way to assess the various reasons underlying the recent decline in migration is to examine the question ""Why did you move?"" that is asked of migrants in the Current Population Survey. Although the responses to this question are fairly coarse and highly variable from year to year, some patterns emerge."
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…source of United States data when comparing migration rates across countries.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (March CPS) as one of three main sources for constructing United States migration rates.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey data in all figures and analyses are based on microdata rather than published tables, in order to exclude individuals in group quarters or with imputed migration data. The imputation exclusion matters for the Current Population Survey because their imputation methodology biased migration estimates upward from 1999 to 2005.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey sample excludes 1985 and 1995 because the one-year migration variable is unavailable for those years, and 1981 is excluded from the out-migration regressions because data on previous state is unavailable; due to missing information regarding negative equity shares, 49 states are represented in the Current Population Survey sample.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the estimated levels of migration in the IRS and ACS are similar to one another and were more than 50% higher than the Current Population Survey estimates in 2008, the latest year for which all three datsets are available.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data is a much smaller sample than the other data sources (about 33% of the ACS and 1% of the decennial Census), so analysis of finer geographic areas is problematic with this source.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data reports a sharp decline since 2005 in annual migration rates. Indeed, the precipitous drop in the Current Population Survey migration estimates brought mobility by that measure to its lowest recorded level since the survey began in the late 1940s. This dramatic decline coincided with a severe housing market downturn.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data shows that tax filers tend to migrate more frequently than nonfilers, but these differences also have not changed much over time.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source allows researchers to construct annual time series on migration over long time periods.
158~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source is similar to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey in that it asks individuals whether their residence in the previous year was in the same state or county as their current residenc; also, like the American Community Survey, it provides the previous state of residence but not the county.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…although the lack of data on nonfilers should raise the estimated level of migration rates in the IRS data relative to the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey, it should not affect the trends.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…based on the universe of tax filers, this source computes the number of returns and the number of exemptions calimed that flow between pairs of locations.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…because researchers are unable to explain the divergence in migration rates between the Current Population Survey and other data sources, it is difficult to determine which source presents a more accurate picture of migration in the past five years. Researchers lean towards the IRS and ACS estimates, partly because they are based on larger samples, and partly because other datasets that have been examined, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Survey of Income and Program Participation.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…due to missing information from IRS data, 46 states are represented in the IRS sample.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…flows between pairs of counties are only reported for values greater than a certain level. However, the IRS also reports gross inflows and outflows from each county to all other countries, so the data still can be aggregated to measure national flows across country boundaries.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…Internal Revenue Service (IRS) migration data as one of three main sources for constructing United States migration rates.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…the estimated levels of migration in the IRS and ACS are similar to one another (which is somewhat surprising because the sources and methodology on which they are based are quite different) and were more than 50% higher than the Current Population Survey estimates in 2008, the latest year for which all three datsets are available.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data source has calculated inter-state migration rates since 1975 and inter-county migration rates since the early 1980s. These data provide the best detail on migration flows between pairs of states and counties.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data source reports flows in both directions between each pair of locations, so both gross flows and net flows can be calculated.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data source reports the total number of non-migrants, which is useful for calculating migration rates.
158~D3~D3~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data suggests that migration has fallen, but the magnitude of this decline is much more modest and, in the case of the IRS, the decrease merely seems to continue the downward trend since the 1980s.
158~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…data drawn in order to analyze wider trends in migration against employment status and home ownership status.
158~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…this data does not show large declines in migration since 2005.
158~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…this data does not show large declines in migration since 2005.
158~D6~D6~Dataset~CoreLogic~…loan-level data used to compute the share of mortgages with negative equity.
158~D6~D6~Dataset~CoreLogic~…source of house price data.
158~D7~D7~Dataset~LPS Applied Analytics~…loan-level data used to compute the share of mortgages with negative equity.
158~D8~D8~Dataset~Eurobarometer~…Eurobarometer data is derived from a survey administered in September and October of 2005, and the responses refer to mobility since the start of the year.
158~D8~D8~Dataset~Eurobarometer~…source of European data, distributed as ICPSR #4641.
158~D8~D8~Dataset~Eurobarometer~…the Eurobarometer is a survey across the European Union on a variety of topics, with a sample size of around 1,000 per country - which in 2005 included questions on mobility, allowing the calculation of one-year migration rates.
158~D8~D8~Dataset~Eurobarometer~"…the most recent Eurobarameter wave that asked questions on change of residence was 64.1, which was collected in September and October 2005. Tabulation of this data is derived fro question A4 in the survey, which asks the respondent ""And could you tell me what year you moved in [to your current residence]?"" Hence, these mobility rates should be interpreted as a move of any sort (across country, within country, and so on)."
158~D8~D8~Dataset~Eurobarometer~…to covert into an estimate of 12 month mobility, European rates in the table have been multiplied by 4/3. Rates are for individuals 16 years and older.
158~D8~D8~Dataset~Eurobarometer~…using this data source, researchers compare one-year mobility rates in 2005 for 26 European countries to the one-year mobility rate in 2005 for the United States (note that this mobility rate measure is computed as a move of any sort).
158~D9~D9~Dataset~European Labor Force Survey~…migration between European countries where data are available has increased in the 2000s, a trend potentially related to rising economic integration across the European Union.
158~D9~D9~Dataset~European Labor Force Survey~…researchers have used publically available summary statistics on within-country, inter-NUTS2 mobility to compare internal mobility in 15 European countries to inter-state mobility in the United States.
158~D9~D9~Dataset~European Labor Force Survey~…this data source asks respondents about their mobility over the previous year.
158~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~5-year Migration Rate~…5-year migration rates are estimated from microdata on the fraction of households with a 4- or 5-year old residing outside of their birth state.
158~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~5-year Migration Rate~…estimates for 1980 to 2000 are from Decennial Census microdata; estimates for 2009 are from American community Survey microdata.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~1-year Migration Rate~…migration can typically be observed over an individual's lifetime or over a recent period, usually the last twelve months or five years. Often, only the end points of these time periods are observed. For example, a person who resided in the same metropolitan area five years ago and at the time of the survey would be classified as a non-migrant, even if that person lived in a different metropolitan area for some of the intervening years. Moreover, individuals who have moved many times will be indistinguishable from individuals who have only moved once. This type of measurement error is most severe when considering lifetime migration, since some migrants will have returned to their birth state after having spent perhaps considerable time elsewhere.
158~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~5-year Migration Rate~…migration can typically be observed over an individual's lifetime or over a recent period, usually the last twelve months or five years.

158~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~5-year Migration Rate~…the fraction of people who live in a different location after five years.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~1-year Migration Rate~…the fraction of people who live in a different location after one year.
158~D6, D7~DV10~Derived Variable~Future Household Value~…one house price mechanism that declines concerns about the future value of housing, reducing the incentive for rents to become homeowners and for current homeowners to trade up into higher-quality units.
158~D6, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~House-Lock~…house-lock should prevent borrowers from moving out of their home.
158~D6, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~House-Lock~…if house-lock were reducing migration, researchers would also expect the migration rate of homeowners to have fallen more than that of renters in high negative equity states compared to other states.
158~D6, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~House-Lock~…it is possible that house-lock may become a larger factor in impeding the labor market recovery if homeowners are unable to move as the demand for labor expands.
158~D6, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~House-Lock~…one house price mechanism that occurs when house prices drop considerable so that homeowners owe more than their mortgage than their property is worth.
158~D6, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~House-Lock~…when calculating the share of mortgages with negative equity using loan-level data from LPS Applied Analytics and CoreLogic (neither of which includes second liens), the state rankings of the fraction of mortgages with negative equity is very stable between 2007 and 2010.
158~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Life-Cycle Migration~…it is possible that life-cycle migration patterns differ across socioeconomic and demographic groups, but without detailed longitudinal data, it is difficult to gauge the severity of these issues.
158~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Life-Cycle Migration~…migration can typically be observed over an individual's lifetime or over a recent period, usually the last twelve months or five years. Often, only the end points of these time periods are observed. For example, a person who resided in the same metropolitan area five years ago and at the time of the survey would be classified as a non-migrant, even if that person lived in a different metropolitan area for some of the intervening years. Moreover, individuals who have moved many times will be indistinguishable from individuals who have only moved once. This type of measurement error is most severe when considering lifetime migration, since some migrants will have returned to their birth state after having spent perhaps considerable time elsewhere.

Often, only the end points of these time periods are observed. For example, a person who resided in the same metropolitan area five years ago and at the time of the survey would be classified as a non-migrant, even if that person lived in a different metropolitan area for some of the intervening years.

This type of measurement error is most severe when considering lifetime migration, since some migrants will have returned to their birth state after having spent perhaps considerable time elsewhere.
158~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Life-Cycle Migration~…one issue with lifetime migration is that some individuals will have moved when they were still a member of their parents' household, and in the data, such people may be indistinguishable from individuals who move frequently during their adult lives.
158~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Life-Cycle Migration~…a consequence of the data limitations described in the previous section is that lifetime migration rates do not necessarily reflect recent migration decisions; in turn, they will typically reflect location decisions that are relatively dated.
158~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Life-Cycle Migration~…the fraction of people who live in a different location than where they were born.
158~D1, D2, D8, D9, D11~DV14~Derived Variable~Mobility Rates~…computed as the fraction of households that went through any sort of move in an annual period.
158~D1, D2, D8, D9, D12~DV14~Derived Variable~Mobility Rates~…computed for mobility between nine regions in England from the British Office for National Statistics.
158~D1, D2, D8, D9, D13~DV14~Derived Variable~Mobility Rates~…mobility is often pro-cyclical, so economic contractions would be expected to reduce mobility; however, it is believed that the decrease in mobility is best-understood as a longer-term trend, and that the economic contraction and the housing market bust appear to have contributed relatively little in addition to the longer-run factors.
158~D1, D2, D8, D9, D14~DV14~Derived Variable~Mobility Rates~…to convert into an estimate of 12 month mobility, European rates in the table have been multiplied by 4/3.
158~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Out-Migration~…when determining whether underwater mortgages caused the decline in migration rates, as house-lock should prevent borrowers from moving out of their home, the measure of migration researchers look at is out-migration from a state added to migration between counties within the same state.
158~D1, D6, D7~DV16~Derived Variable~Recession, House-Lock~…an interaction between the recessionary indicator and the share of mortgages with negative equity in 2009:Q3 (regressions using IRS data end in 2008 instead of 2010).
158~D1, D6, D7~DV17~Derived Variable~Recession, Share of Negative Equity State Households, Home Ownership~…pooled linear-log regressions include a triple interaction of the post-2006 dummy, the share of households in a state with negative equity, and a dummy of whether the migration rate is for renters.
158~D6, D7~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Negative Equity State Households~…the percent of mortgages with negative equity is from CoreLogic data.
158~D6, D7~DV18~Derived Variable~Share of Negative Equity State Households~…the share of households in a state with negative equity.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~State-Specific Time Trends~…linear-log regressions on migration rates control for state-specific time trends.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~State-Specific Time Trends~…researchers include state-specific time trends in linear-log regressions on migration rates because an F-test of their joint significance strongly rejects that the trends are the same in all states. When excluding state-specific time trends, the probability of having moved over any distance fell more in high negative equity states than other states.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Age Distribution~…linear-log regressions on migration rates control for the age distribution.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Average Mobility Rate~…the dependent variable in alternate specifications of the linear log model is the average mobility rate for each state-year-renter status group.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Migration Rate~…drivers of changes in the aggregate migration rate can be divided into three main mechanisms. First the distribution of individuals characteristics that are correlated with the net benefits of migration - for example, demographic factors - can change; second, migration choises for particular groups of individuals can change; and third, changing fundamental economic factors may influence the net benefits to migration for a broad range of individuals.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Migration Rate~…migration scholars today generally make two decision to define migrants: 1) they choose geographic units to definte potential origin and destination locations; and 2) they define the time period in which individuals must move between origins and edestinations.
158~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Migration Rate~…population flows between regions, states, or cities within a single country.
158~D6, D7~DV4~Derived Variable~Average House Prices~…house prices are repeat-sales indexes computed by CoreLogic.
158~D6, D7~DV4~Derived Variable~Average House Prices~…researchers use annual averages of home sales and prices to smooth out noise in the data and restrict the peak to between 2004 and 2006 and the trough to be between 2007 and 2009.
158~D12~DV5~Derived Variable~Average House Sales~…home sales are sales of existing homes from the National Association of Realtors.
158~D12~DV5~Derived Variable~Average House Sales~…researchers use annual averages of home sales and prices to smooth out noise in the data and restrict the peak to between 2004 and 2006 and the trough to be between 2007 and 2009.
158~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Out-Migration~…the sum of out-migration from a state and inter-county migration within the state.
158~D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Average Household Income~…linear-log regressions on migration rates control for the average household income.
158~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Costs of Migration~…migration costs depend on the origin, destination, and individual demographic characteristics, but they can also change over time due to a variety of factors including the cost of searching for a new job or home, the cost of terminating a current job or selling a home, or the cost of relocating one's household.
158~D10~DV8~Derived Variable~Cross-Province Mobility~…cross-province mobility in Canada only.
158~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Fraction of Respondents Reporting Various Reasons~…reports the fraction of respondents reporting various reasons for moving during the 2003 to 2006 period, when aggregate migration was rising or flat, and during the 2007 to 2010 period, when aggregate migration was falling.
158~D1~F1~Findings~Cross-State and Cross-Region Migration Over the Relevant Period~…roughly 1.5% of the population moves between two of the four Census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) annually, and about the same number of individuals (roughly 1.3% of the population) move to a different state within the same region. In addition, roughly 3% move across counties within the same state. All together, in each year between 5% and 6% of the population moves across a county boundary, which is often a long-enough distance to make a meaningful difference in their local housing and labor market environment.
158~D1, D2, D3~F10~Findings~Migration, the Business Cycle and the Great Recession~…the magnitude of the drop in migration that coincided with the economic recession (from 2007 to 2010) is somewhat smaller than that of previous recessions, even though the current episode was much worse along many dimensions of the labor market. Thus, the business cycle seems unlikely to be the main explanation of the recent decrease in migration.
158~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Inter-County Migration and Ten- and Twenty-Year Trend Hypotheticals~…actual inter-county migration fell by 0.36 percentage point in the CPS, and by 0.72 percentage point in the ACS from 2007 to 2009. Extrapolating the downward trend from the previous ten years (1996-2006), migration would have fallen 0.23 percentage point from 2007 to 2009 had it followed trend. Based on the previous 20 years (1986-2006), migration would have fallen by 0.25 percentage point from 2007 to 2009. Therefore, after accounting for existing downward trend in migration, there is seemingly little additional decline for the cycle to explain.
158~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Inter-State and Inter-County Migration and Homeowner Status~…in both the CPS and the ACS, neither inter-state nor inter-county migration rates fell more for homeowners than they did for renters in percentage point terms. It is true that homeowners have much lower migration rates, so the percentage decline in migration was larger for homeowners than for renters. But overall, recent changes in migration rates of both homeowners and renters have been similar to their longer-run downward trends, suggesting that the housing cycle has not appreciably affected the migration patterns of these groups.
158~D1, D2, D6, D7~F13~Findings~Migration Rates and Underwater Mortgages~…researchers find no evidence that migration rates were lower in the recent period in states with a larger share of underwater mortgages. The drop in in-migration is clearly not due to house-lock and, although the drop in within-county migration might be due to house-lock, within-county migration is too short to affect labor market participation. In addition, researchers find no evidence that migration out of state fell more in high negative equity states when excluding state-specific time trends.
158~D1, D2, D6, D7~F14~Findings~Linear Log Regressions and Underwater Mortgages~…although the coefficient on the triple interaction variable is positive when the dependent variable is out-migration - potentially consistent with house lock - it is small in magnitude and not statistically significant. A relatively large increase in the fraction of underwater mortgages of 0.1 is assocciate with a 0.25 percentage point increase in the migration rate of renters relative to homeowners in the post-2006 period. this difference is less than one tenth of the typical gap between renter and homeowner migration rates.
158~D1, D6, D7, D12~F15~Findings~Migration, House Sales, and House Prices~…researchers find no evidence that migration fell more in recent period in states with larger declines in housing market activity as measured by sales or prices.
158~D2~F16~Findings~Reasons for Moving and Type of Migration~"…among inter-state migrants, the reasons for moving that fell the most between the two periods are ""attend/leave college,"" ""change in marital status,"" ""other family reason,"" and ""natural disaster."" Decreases in job-related and housing-related reasons are small. By contrast the fraction of inter-county, within state migrants that moved ""to own home, not rent,"" for ""new or better housing,"" for a ""better neighborhood"" or for ""other housing reasons"" decreased markedly. Thus, the housing market might have exerted some downward pressure on within-state migration, although not for longer-distance migration. An important caveat to this analysis that people may move for a variety of factors and asking them to choose a single reason may be misleading."
158~D1~F17~Findings~Mobility Rate in the United States and Europe~…the United States mobility rate is significantly higher than the mobility rate for most European countries: more specifically, United States mobility by this measure is about twice as large as mobility in most European countries outside of Northern Europe. Mobility rates tend to be higher in Scandinavian countries and in Great Britain than in other European countries, and mobility in some of these countries, like Denmark and Finland, slightly exceeds the United States mobility rate.
158~D9~F18~Findings~Mobility Rate Trends in the European Labor Force Survey~…mobility rates for 15 European countries in the European Labor Force Survey were either flat or slightly increasing during the first half of the 2000s, but still generally remain below inter-state migration estimates for the United States. The only exceptions are thatcross-NUTS2, within-country migration rates for Denmark and Hungary are slightly higher by 2007 than the United States inter-state mobility rate. 
158~D11~F19~Findings~Mobility Rate Trends in the United Kingdom~…the level and trend in inter-region mobility in the United Kingdom was similar to the IRS measure of United States interstate migration; inter-region United Kingdom migration decreased from 2.3% in 1999 to 2.0% in 2008.
158~D1, D2, D3~F2~Findings~5-Year vs. 1-Year Rates and Lifetime vs. 5-Year Rates~…because some people move frequently while others move rarely, the fraction of the population that has moved within the past five years is only about 4 times the annual migration rates. Lifetime migration rates are roughly 3.5 times higher than 5-year migration rates. In total, slighly less than 33% of the population lives in a different state than they were born, while slightly less than 20% live in a different Census region. Thus a substantial fraction of the population has moved a relatively long distance at some point during their lifetimes.
158~D1, D2~F3~Findings~5-Year Cross-State Moves for Young Respondents~…among those who live in a different state than their birth state, roughly 35% of the 18-34 year olds have moved across state lines in the past five years (averaging across the 1980, 1990 and 2000 Censuses). Thus, nearly 67% had moved more than 5 years previously, even at that relatively young age.
158~D1~F4~Findings~Lifetime Migrants and 5-Year Rates by Age~…15% of 35 to 64 year-old lifetime migrants had moved within the last five years, while only 8% of lifetime migrants older than 64 had moved within the past five years.
158~D1, D2, D3~F5~Findings~MSAs and Past Location of Residence~…among individuals whose current MSA of residence is reported, about 15% moved either from another identified MSA or across state lines in the last five years.
158~D1~F6~Findings~5-Year and 1-Year Migration Rates and Metropolitan Areas~…according to the five-year migration statistics from the Census and one-year migration statistics from the ACS, virtually all (97%) of cross-state migrants also changed metropolitan areas, while only 60% to 70% of migrants across metropolitan areas also changed states. Thus, inter-state migration underestimates the number of people that move across local labor and housing market boundaries. By contrast, inter-county migration overstates metropolitan area migration, as only three quarters of cross-county migrants changed metropolitan areas.
158~D1, D2, D3~F7~Findings~Fraction of Middle Age and Inter-State Migration~…the fraction of the population age 45 to 64 expanded from 20% in 1981 to 25% in 2010 (the fraction older than 64 did not change much). Based on the average differential between migration rates of this group and the rest of the population, the rise in the 45 to 64 population share would only have reduced aggregate inter-state migration by 0.1 percentage point, less than one tenth of the aggregate decrease in inter-state migration.
158~D1~F8~Findings~Fraction of those Working from Home Over the Relevant Period~…the fraction of workers who reported working from home rose from 2.1% in the 1980 Census to 4.1% in the 2009 American Community Survey suggesting that technological advances have allowed for an expansion of telecommuting and flexible work schedules, reducing the need for workers to move for a job; however, this increase seems to be too small to account for the substantial decrease in migration over the relevant time period.
158~D2, D3~F9~Findings~Inter-State and Inter-County Migration~…in both the Current Population Survey and the IRS data, the current decrease in inter-state migration is about the same magnitude as the 1990 to 1991 and 2001 recessions, and the decrease in inter-county migration is larger than in these two recessions; however, the current recession did not begin until the end of 2007, and migration began to fall one to two years earlier.
158~V17~L1~Variable Value~Attend/Leave College~…one of eighteen possible reasons for moving in the Current Population Survey.
158~V17~L1~Variable Value~Attend/Leave College~"…the decrease in the ""attend/leave college"" category disappears when researchers restrict the sample to respondents over 35, although it is still appreciable among respondents between age 25 and 35."

158~DV1~L6~Variable Value~5-Year Cross Region~…describes population flows between groups of states, is unlikely to suffer from misclassification even though some between-county movers remain within the same local labor market, while between-metropolitan migrants will not be counted in inter-state migration statistics. 
158~DV1~L7~Variable Value~5-Year Cross-Commuting Zone~…cross-commuting zone migrants are defined as having moved to a new commuting zone.
158~DV1~L7~Variable Value~5-Year Cross-Commuting Zone~…this measure does not suffer from under- or overestimation since the commuting zone concept encompasses the entire United States.
158~DV1~L7~Variable Value~5-Year Cross-Commuting Zone~…this measure may be the most relevant concept in determining migration across local labor markets since they are based on commuting patterns; however, this measure introduces its own measurement complications and migration across commuting-zones cannot be precisely measured.
158~DV1~L7~Variable Value~5-Year Cross-Commuting Zone~…using a cross-walk between counties and commuting zones, and PUMAs and commuting zones (for 1990 and 2000), researchers can roughly identify migration across commuting zones.
158~DV1~L8~Variable Value~5-Year Cross-County~…cross-county migrants are defined as moving across any state boundary.
158~DV1~L8~Variable Value~5-Year Cross-County~…this measure overstates metropolitan area migration, as only 75% of cross-county migrants changed metropolitan areas.

158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…all covariates are calculated from the Current Populaiton Survey. Standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. Regressions are weighted by the state population in the CPS sample, and by the sum of mover and stayer exemptions in the IRS data.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…alternate specification regressions are state-year-renter status regressions of migration rates on year and state fixed effects and state time trends, and covariates listed above. Dependent variable is the average mobility rate for each state-year-renter status group. The sample period is 1981 to 2010; 1985 and 1995 are excluded because the one-year migration variable is unavailabe for those years, and 1981 is excluded from the out-migration regressions because data on previous state is unavailable.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…for baseline specifications of the model, researchers use all three relevant sources (i.e. the ACS, IRS, and CPS) to examine the changes in migration since 2006, a period when migration rates decreased in all three sources.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…in a simple, one-period version of the standard model, individuals choose consumption and location to maximize utility given the prevailing wage and price level in each location. If researchers assume an initial distribution of individuals across locations, migration arises as individuals move from local labor markets where the return on their individual skills is relatively low to markets were this return is relatively high. Migration thus becomes a form of human capital investment: a project that individuals can undertake to raise the returns to their labor.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…models of migration recognize that a change in residential location is costy.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…one can expand the standard model to include roles for factors that vary across individuals and across time for a given location, such as an individual's age or changes in relative prices and wages across locations.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…regressions are state-year regressions of migration rates on years and state fixed effects and state time trends and covariates listed above.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…researchers test the conjcture that house-lock would lead the migration rate of homeowners to have fallen more than that of renters in high negative equity state compared to other states by calculating mobility rates separately for homeowners and renters and running pooled regression including a triple interaction of the post-2006 dummy, the share of households in a state with negative equity, and a dummy for whether the migration rate is for renters.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…the regressions control for state and year fixed effects, the unemployment rate, the logarithm of average household income, the age distribution of the population, and state-specific linear time trends.
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…to explore the effect of underwater mortgages on migration rates, researchers regress state migration rates from 1981 to 2010 on an indicator for the 2007 to 2010 period and an interaction between this indicator and the share of mortgages with negative equity in 2009:Q3 (regressions using IRS data end in 2008 insted of 2010).
158~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…to see if other aspects of the housing market contraction - such as diminished desire to invest in housing - may have suppressed migration, researchesr estimate similar regressions but interact the post-2006 indicator with the peak-to-trough decline in existing home sales or the peak-to-trough decline in house prices.
158~D1~T1~Time Period~1940-2000~…survey period of the U.S. Census from which researchers can observe whether an individual is currently residing in a different state or county than five years ago, as well as the exact state of residence in those two periods.
158~D2~T11~Time Period~1981-2010~…the relevant sample period for linear log regressions of migration rates on year and state fixed effects for the Current Population Survey sample. This period excludes 1985 and 1995 because the one-year migration variable is unavailable for those years, and 1981 is excluded from the out-migration regressions because data on previous state is unavailable.
158~D3~T10~Time Period~1977-2008~…the relevant sample period for linear log regressions of migration rates on year and state fixed effects for the IRS sample.
158~D1~T2~Time Period~1980-2000~…survey period of the U.S. Census from which researchers can observe the current metropolitan area and the metropolitan area of residence five years ago for individuals living both periods.
158~D1~T3~Time Period~2000-2009~…survey period through which annual Census data through the American Community Survey is available.
158~D1~T4~Time Period~2005-2009~…survey period through which annual Census data through the American Community Survey is available for the entire United States.
158~D1~T5~Time Period~1850-2000~…survey period from which researchers can construct an approximation of lifetime migration by comparing current state of residence to an individual's birth state using Census data.
158~D2~T6~Time Period~1965-2010~…survey period from which Current Population Survey microdata is drawn in order to calculate migration rates.
158~D2~T7~Time Period~1948-2010~…extended survey period from which Current Population Survey data is drawn with the help of additional published tables.
158~D3~T8~Time Period~1975-2008~…relevant survey period from which IRS data on inter-state migration rates and inter-county migration rates are drawn.
158~D2, D3~T9~Time Period~1992-2009~…survey period for which information on tax return filing is available from the IRS and the Current Population Survey.
158~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Age~…a demographic characteristic variable indicating the respondent's age for which migration trends are compared against.
158~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Age~…five aggregated age groups used in order to differentiate migration trends by age range.
158~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Metropolitan Area~…a common approach in determining the close approximations of local labor markets is to refer to a metropolitan area, which is typically defined by governmental statistical agencies using commuting patterns in order to capture the idea of a local labor market.
158~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Metropolitan Area~…a variety of names have been used for metropolitan areas with slightly varying definitions, including metropolitan statistical area (MSA), core-based statistical area (CBSA), and Economic Area (EA).
158~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Metropolitan Area~…in practice, using metropolitan areas to define the origin and destination of migrants has some drawbacks. First, these areas do not cover the entire United States, so population flows from rural to metropolitan areas will not be counted as migrants. Second, metropolitan area boundaries are revised every few years in order to reflect the current patterns of economic activity, which poses problems for measuring migration consistently over time. Third, metropolitan area identifiers are not available in many public datasets.
158~D6, D7~V11~Variable~Negative Equity~…the share of negative is estimated by CoreLogic and includes second liens.
158~D3~V12~Variable~Number of Exemptions~…the number of expemptions claimed, which approximates people that flow between pairs of locations, as reported by the IRS.
158~D3~V13~Variable~Number of Returns~…approximates the number of households by region, as reported by the IRS.
158~D9~V14~Variable~NUTS2~"…the difficult of defining comparable geographic units is partially mitigated by defining internal mobility as a movement within a country between what are called ""NUTS2""units - for Nomencalture of Territorial Units for Statistics, Subdivision 2. "
158~D9~V14~Variable~NUTS2~…the population of a NUTS2 ranges approximately from 800,000 to 3,000,000, which is roughly comparable to the population of many U.S. states.
158~D1~V15~Variable~Public Use Microdata Area~…the commuting zone and public use microdata area (PUMA) concepts present alternatives to the MSA that get around the first of its faults. Like MSAs, these areas are generally (though not always) defined as groups of counties; however, unlike MSAs, they cover the entire United States.
158~D2~V16~Variable~Race~…a demographic characteristic variable indicating the respondent's race for which migration trends are compared against.
158~D2~V17~Variable~Reasons for Moving~"…one way to assess the various reasons underlying the recent decline in migration is to examine the question ""Why did you move?"" that is asked of migrants in the Current Population Survey. Although the responses to this question are fairly coarse and highly variable from year to year, some patterns emerge."
158~D2~V17~Variable~Reasons for Moving~…the downside with this variable is that people may move for a variety of factors and asking them to choose a single reason may be misleading.
158~D1, D2, D3~V18~Variable~Recession~…an indicator for the 2007 to 2010 period as included in regressions on state migration rates.
158~D1, D2, D3~V19~Variable~State Fixed Effects~…linear-log regressions on migration rates control for state fixed effects.
158~D2~V2~Variable~Child Presence~…a demographic characteristic variable specifying for whether there is at least one child in the household for which migration trends are compared against.
158~D1, D2~V20~Variable~State Lines~…because of data limitations with identifying MSAs, state and county lines are used to approximate local labor market. Fortunately, both provide a reasonable proxy of inter-metropolitan migration.
158~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Unemployment Rate~…linear-log regressions on migration rates control for the unemployment rate.
158~D1, D2, D3~V22~Variable~Year Fixed Effects~…linear-log regressions on migration rates control for year fixed effects.
158~D2~V23~Variable~Number of Working Adults~…the reported number of working adults in the household for married couples.
158~D2~V24~Variable~Immigrant Status~…this variable can only be measured from 1994 onwards.
158~D2~V3~Variable~Commuting Zones~…commuting zones are defined by common commuting patterns, and divide the country into 741 local labor markets.
158~D2~V3~Variable~Commuting Zones~…multiple counties or PUMAs may exist in a single commuting zone, and some commuting zones may cross county or PUMA boundaries. For this reason, it is not possible to know precisely what commuting zone some observations are in. In the statistics reported with this variable, researchers conservatively assume that an individual did not move across commuting zones if there is at least one commuting zone that is a common member of the set of possible commuting zones of current residence and of residence five years earlier.
158~D2~V3~Variable~Commuting Zones~…using publicly available Census microdata, in 1980 commuting zones can be determined by county of residence, and in 1990 and 2000, commuting zones can be determined by PUMA.
158~D1, D2, D3~V4~Variable~County Lines~…because of data limitations with identifying MSAs, state and county lines are used to approximate local labor market. Fortunately, both provide a reasonable proxy of inter-metropolitan migration.
158~D2~V5~Variable~Education~…a demographic characteristic variable indicating the respondent's education level for which migration trends are compared against.
158~D2~V6~Variable~Employment Status~…an economic characteristic variable specifying for unemployment or employment for which migration trends are compared against.
158~D2~V6~Variable~Employment Status~…this variable is only recorded in the Current Population Survey for the current year.
158~D2~V7~Variable~Gender~…a binary variable specifying for gender in order to compare recessionary migration trends by gender.
158~D2~V8~Variable~Home Ownership~…a binary varialbe specifying for whether the migration rate is for renters or for home ownership.
158~D2~V8~Variable~Home Ownership~…an economic characteristic variable specifying for renters or homeowners for which migration trends are compared against.
158~D2~V8~Variable~Home Ownership~…this variable is only recorded in the Current Population Survey for the current year.
158~D2~V9~Variable~Immigrant Status~…a demographic characteristic variable specifying for immigrant status for which migration trends are compared against.

159~D1~T1~Time Period~December 1998 and August 2000~…the time period includes December 1998 and August 2000, as these months are the sole dates that the Computer and Internet Use Supplements were included in the Current Population Survey.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data is not collected on non-Internet job, thus this dataset does not allow one to distinguish Internet job search activity from the decision to look for work in the first place.

159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data consideration that led to the restriction of one outcome, jobless duration, relies the fact that the Current Population Survey does not include wage for a sufficient sample of job seekers, thus it is impossible to ascertain from the data whether Internet search produces better job matches.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…wage information is only available for persons who find new jobs, and who are in the outgoing rotation goups.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the December 1998 and August 2000 Computer and Internet Use Supplements include a question about individual respondent or family Intenet job search, while the regular monthly survey asks unemployed individuals which out of a list of nine ""traditional"" job search methods they used."
159~D1~V2~Variable~Internet Job Search Rate~…classified by labor force status.
159~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Labor Force Status~…whether an individual is employed, seeking employment, or out of the labor force.
159~D1~V4~Variable~Internet Access~…among unemployed persons increased from 22.3% to 39.4% from December 1998 to August 2000.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in order to measure the job-finding success of Internet versus other job searchers, researchers match observations in the December 1998 Computer and Internet Use Supplement with the same persons in the ten subsequent Current Population Surveys (January through March 1999, September 1999 through March 2000) and similarly match the August 2000 survey with surveys in September through November of 2000, and May through November of 2001 in both of which some of the same individuals were reinterviewed.
159~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau Labor Statistics~…source of restrictive definition of unemployment.
159~V3~L1~Variable Value~Unemployed~"…unemployed persons must not be working, and either ""on layoff"" from a job to which they expected to be recalled or searching for work using at least one of nine recognized active methods."
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…limiting the definition of unemployment according to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics yielded a sample of 4,139 persons.
159~D1~V5~Variable~Traditional Methods~…nine recognized traditional methods of job seeking that are specificied as to see how Internet job searchers fare in receiving a job when compared to traditional job seekers.
159~D1~V5~Variable~Traditional Methods~…it is important to note that these traditional measures of job search activity could themselves involve Internet use, in which case they may be natural complements with Internet search.
159~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Length of Unemployment~…the average duration an Internet searcher or non-Internet searcher has been unemployed for, reported in months. 
159~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Average Length of Unemployment at Survey Date~…the average unemployed Internet searcher had already been unemployed for 3.44 months, significantly less than the 3.75 month retrospective duration of the non-Internet searchers.
159~D1, D2~V7~Variable~State Unemployment Rate~…in order to account for unemployment rate variation across different areas of the residence for the Current Population Survey respondents.
159~D1~V8~Variable~State of Residence~…for an individual respondent of the Current Population Survey Computer and Internet Use Supplements and regular monthly surveys.
159~D1~V9~Variable~Occupation Unemployment Rate~…in order to account for unemployment rate variation across different occupations for the Current Population Survey respondents.
159~D1~V17~Variable~Occupation~…for an individual respondent of the Current Population Survey Computer and Internet Use Supplements and regular monthly surveys.
159~V17~L5~Variable Value~Private Sector~…an individual respondent has indicated that they were previously employed in the private sector before their unemployment spell.
159~V17~L6~Variable Value~Public Sector~…an individual respondent has indicated that they were previously employed in the public sector before their unemployment spell.
159~V17~L7~Variable Value~Self-Emplyed~…an individual respondent has indicated that they were previously self-employed before their unemployment spell.

159~D1~V15~Variable~Immigrant Status~…in order to account for differences between immigrants and non-immigrants in their job seeking strategies.
159~D1~V16~Variable~Homeowner Status~…in order to account for differences between Homeowners and Non-Homeowners in their job seeking strategies.
159~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Demographic Summary~…unemployed Internet searchers resided in states with lower unemployment rates, had previously wored in occupations with considerably lower unemployment rates, were more likely to have been employed prior to the current unemployment spell, were much better educated, were more likely to be in their prime working ages, were less likely to be black, Hispanic, or immigrant, and were more likely to be homeowners than other unemployed job seekers.
159~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Internet Searchers Traditional Method Use~…unemployed Internet searchers were more likely to use traditional job search methods than other unemployed workers, using 2.17 tradtional search methods compared to 1.67 for other unemployed workers, suggesting an overall complementarity between Internet and non-Internet methods.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…no one in the restricted sample was employed in the month in which researchers observe whether their job search strategy incorporated the Internet, i.e. December 1998 or August 2000.
159~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Reemployment Status Over Time~…among those individuals whose labor market status was observed one month after the Supplement date, 29.1% were employed, while 37.5% were employed two months after, and 55.9% were employed a year later, with the pooled individual respondents resulting in the same share of employment some time after the Supplement date, 55.9%.
159~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Internet vs. Non-Internet Searchers Reemployment Over Time~…comparing Internet job searchers with other unemployed workers, there is essentially no difference in employment rates one or two months after an individual's Internet job search activity is observed, however a year later 64.6% of unemployed Internet searchers are reemployed, compared to 53.3% of other unemployment workers, a difference that is statistically significant.
159~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…the equations used by the researchers are estimated by ordinary least squares as long as the vector of shocks to search costs is uncorrelated with shocks to reem unemployment rates where the latter may include a permanent person-specifc effect, i.e. unobserved reemployability.
159~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…the framework used in this research paper does not allow for heterogeneity in the margnial effectiveness of Internet search across individuals.
159~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…an outcome of job search is a linear function of a vector of exogenous observables, a vector of nine endogenously chosen traditional search methods, an indicator variable for the use of Internet methods and a random term.
159~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Direct Effect~…an Internet search effect of potential interest that gives the effect effect of Internet search on outcomes holding all other search methods fixed.
159~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Total Effect~…an Internet search effect of potential interest that gives its effect when all other search methods are adjusted optimally to the adoption of Internet search.
159~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Probit~…estimates of probit models for Internet job search, as well as for the outcomes of job search, with regressors including characteristics of the individual, his/her unemployment spell, and the individual's activity before entering the current unemployment spell.
159~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Probit~…all specifications presented for each probit equation with and without a control for home Internet access.
159~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Internet Search and Demographics~…Internet search grew rapidly between 1998 and 2000, was more common in occupations with low unemployment rates, among young and well-educated workers, and among persons who entered unemployment either from work or school, confirming the researchers' strong impressions of positive selection on observables.
159~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Racial and Ethnic Divide in Internet Job Search~…particularly noteworth are the highly significant correlations between being black or Hispanic and using the Internet to look for work with coefficient magnitudes of -0.266 and -0.253, respectively, suggesting a digital divde along racial and ethnic lines.
159~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Probit~…the final three probit regressions estimate the probability an unemployed individual is employed 12 months after researchers observe their Internet job search activity in the Current Population Survey Computer and Internet Use Supplement (a focus on 12 months was chosen because it is where the largest apparent Internet effect was observed.
159~D1~F8~Findings~Traditional Method Reemployment ~…when controls are added for the use of other, more traditional job search methods, researchers detect significant positive effects on reemployment for three of them: direct employer contact, resume sending, and public employment agencies.
159~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Probit Estimates of Internet Job Search Effectiveness~…in the probit regressions, Internet job search is found to have little impact on reemployment with coefficients ranging from -0.005 to 0.062, a finding that remains true whether or not researchers hold constant an individual's Internet access from home, and whether or not researchers
159~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Probit~…any probit focusing on a worker's labor force status at only a single data discards a considerable amount of information on the actual duration of unemployment making it possible that these probit estimates might fail to reveal a true, beneficial effect of Internet job search.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the information available in this dataset is highly discrete: at best, it is only known the month in which reemployment occurred and in some cases, it is only known that reemployment occurred during an eight-month period.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers avoid the problem of inappropriateness of a continuous-time duration models by developing a discrete-time hazard model that takes into account the particular features of Current Population Survey duration data while still allowing for a fully flexible form of the baseline hazard function.
159~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Discrete-Time Hazard Model~…researchers develop this model by assuming the hazard rate into reemployment is separable into a baseline component that depends on elapsed duration and a component that depends on a linear combination of observed characteristics and estimated parametes.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in this data, job searchers are observed no more frequently than once per month making the data very discrete.
159~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Discrete-Time Hazard Model~…due to the discreteness of Current Population Survey data, researchers divide the set of possible jobless durations into disjoint intervals, with eight in total.
159~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Disjoint Intervals~…calculated by dividing the set of possible jobless durations into eight disjoint variables ranging from 0 to 1 months all the way to more than 13 months.
159~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Disjoint Intervals~…for some observations, specifically those persons observed as unemployed in one month and employed the next, it is known exactly in which of these intervals their unemployment spell ended, while others are right-censored, due to attrition or rotation out of the sample and for yet some others researchers only know that they became employed at some point within a set of adjacent intervals.
159~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Lower Bound~…a vector of dummy variables applying in order to each of the disjoint intervals except for the 13+ months interval.
159~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Lower Bound~…set equal to zero for all intervals except the one preceding the interval in which the worker's unemployment spell is known to have ended.
159~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Upper Bound~…a vector of upper bound dummy variables, equal to zero for all intervals except the one during which the researchers know the unemployment spell ended.
159~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Cut Points~…a coefficient vector corresponding to the cut points between the upper and lower bound intervals
159~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Discrete-Time Hazard Model~...set up as a log-log model in order to determine the log likelihood of jobless duration.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…reemployment rates are, on average, higher in the 2000 Computer and Internet Use Supplements than the 1998 Supplements.
159~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Home Internet Access and Reemployment Rates~…one interesting difference between the probit and hazard model estimates is that the postive paritial correlation between home Internet access and reemployment rates becomes statistically significant with positive coefficients ranging between 0.263 and 0.292.
159~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Hazard Estimates of Internet Job Search Effectiveness~…the most surprising finding from the hazard model is that Internet job search now appears to be not simply ineffective, as in the probit regression estimates, but instead counterproductive with negative coefficients ranging from -0.350 to -0.170, suggesting that holding constant observable characteristics of the person and the previous duration of the unemployment spell, persons who searched for work online actually entered reemployment more slowly than those who did not during the period after we observe whether they search online.
159~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Hazard Estimates of Indirect Traditional Method Effectiveness~…inspection of the coefficients for traditional job search methods reveals that three of these methods, including public employment agencies, resume sending, and checked union and professional registers, had significant, counterproductive estimated effects on reemployment in the hazard models.
159~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Internet Job Search Results w/ and w/o Characteristic Controls~…according to the data, Internet job search Is more common among workers with observed characteristics that are usually associated with faster remployment, yet at the same time, holding these observed characteristics constant, unemployment durations are not shorter, and possibly even longer among workers who look for work online than among workers who do not.
159~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data does not allow researchers to control for receipt of unemployment insurance, or health status in order to determine whether Internet searchers are more likely to apply and qualify for unemployment insurance, or are using the Internet to search because of health or disability limitations.
159~D1~V5~Variable~Traditional Methods~…the three traditional search methods that were associated with longer durations in the ahzard models are formal and anonymous in nature compared, for example, to direct employer contact and using friends and relatives.
159~D1~V5~Variable~Traditional Methods~…include contacting employers, contacting public employment agencies, contacting private employment agencies, contacting friends or relatives, contacting school employment agencies, sending resumes, checking unions, or using ads.

160~V17~L2~Variable Value~1 Year~…indicates that an individual's initial level of experience was 1 year.
160~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Aggregate Production for the Goods Sector~…specifically, production at time t, valued at the sector's period t real price, is given by the nested CES function.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Distribution of Future Prices~…at any time t, agents in the economy form a common forecast of the distribution of future skill rental prices, and based on that forecast and each agent's current state, including the current set of skill rental prices, the alternative that is optimal is chosen.
160~V12~L3~Variable Value~13-15~…one of four education categories indicating that a respondent completed between 13 and 15 years of schooling.
160~V12~L4~Variable Value~16 and Over~…one of four education categories indicating that a respondent completed 16 or more years of education.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~T5~Time Period~1901-2000~…extended period through which single year categories are drawn using data from the Census, the Current Population, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the NLSY72.
160~D4~T6~Time Period~1910-1960~…relevant survey periods from which decennial Census data is collected on the age 16 (initial) schooling distributions over time and on the preschool children process.
160~D2~T7~Time Period~1947-2000~…relevant survey period from which Bureau of Economic Analysis data is collected on sectoral capital stocks and on output.
160~D2~T1~Time Period~1950-2000~…in 1950, 57% of workers were employed in the service sector; by 1970 that figure had risen to 63% and by 2000 to 75%.
160~D1, D2, D3~T2~Time Period~1968-1980~…the first subperiod of the relevant 1968 to 2000 period using data from the Current Population Survey, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the NLSY72.
160~D1, D2, D3~T3~Time Period~1968-2001~…relevant survey period from which data is drawn from the Current Population Survey, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the NLSY72.
160~D1, D2, D3~T3~Time Period~1968-2001~…the occupational structure of the service and goods sector as well as their workforce compositions have differed substantially throughout the 33-year period, although similar changes have occurred in the two sectors over time.
160~D1, D2, D3~T3~Time Period~1968-2001~…the service sector is now majority female, having increased from 43% of the workforce in 1968 to 53% in 2000. The proportion of workers in the goods sector who are female also increased over the period, from about a fifth of the workforce in 1968 to a quarter in 2000.
160~D3~T4~Time Period~1979-1993~…relevant survey period from which NLSY data on life cycle employment and schooling choices, and on wages is drawn.
160~D1, D2, D3~T3~Time Period~1981-2000~…the second subperiod of the relevant 1968 to 2000 period using data from the Current Population Survey, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the NLSY72.
160~V17~L5~Variable Value~2 Years~…indicates that an individual's initial level of experience was 2 years.
160~V17~L6~Variable Value~3 Years~…indicates that an individual's initial level of experience was 3 years.
160~V17~L7~Variable Value~4+ Years~…indicates that an individual's initial level of experience was 4 years.
160~D1, D2, D4~F1~Findings~Service Share of Output, Capital, Earnings and Employment~…between 1950 and 2000, the service-sector share of output grew by 21 percentage points, from 56.4% to 77.4%; the share of capital grew by 4 percentage points from 79.5% to 83.4%; the share of employment grew by 18 percentage points, from 57.3% to 75.3%; and the share of labor earnings grew by 15 percentage points, from 60.4% to 75.4% of total labor earnings.
160~D1, D2, D4~F10~Findings~Propensity to Remain in the Goods Sector~…consistent with the relative growth in service-sector employment, those who worked in the goods sector at year t-1, at all levels of goods-sector experience, are less likely among those who work at year t to remain in the goods sector. Overall, 81% of males and 75% of females are stayers. Both the overall difference and the difference by the level of goods-sector experience are larger for females than for males, although by the time an individual has accumulated between 10 and 15 years of goods-sector experience, similar to the service sector, 92% of the males and at least 93% of females choose to remain working in the goods sector.
160~D1, D2, D4~F11~Findings~New Entrant Propensity for Sector-Specific Employment~…not having worked in a sector at year t-1 significantly reduces the propensity, among those who work, to work in that sector at year t, at all levels of sector-specific experience. For example, only 37% of males with between 6 and 9 years of service-sector experience remained in that sector at year t if they worked int he goods sector in year t-1. Similarly, only 31% of males with between 6 and 9 years of goods-sector experience remained in that sector at year t if they worked in the service sector in year t-1. These figures are similar for females.
160~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~Gender-Based Sector-Specific Propensities~…NLSY79 data confirms that, as in the CPS data, women entrants or reentrants to employment are more likely to choose the service sector. For example, of those women with no previous experience in the service sector who chose to work at time t, having been at home at time t-1, 80% chose the service sector. The comparable figure for men was 58%. Likewise, of those men with no previous experience in the goods sector who chose to work at time t, having been at home at t-1, 33% chose the goods sector, while the comparable figure for women was 13%.
160~D1, D3~V1~Variable~Age~…individuals age 16 to 65 choose among eight discrete sector-occupational alternatives at each age.
160~D1, D3~V1~Variable~Age~…age in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data, age is limited to the range 16 to 30.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Occupation~…classifies individuals into white-, pink- or blue-collar occupations.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Substition Between Capital and White-Collar Skill~…the elasticity of substitution between capital and white collar skill.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Substitution Between the Composite Capital-White-Collar Skill Input and Other Categories~…the composite capital-white-collar skill input and other skill categories.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Skill Prices~…equilibrium skill prices are determined by equating skill prices to their respective marginal revenue products evaluated at aggregate skill amounts and capital
160~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Skill Prices~…in a rational expectations equilibrium, current and past values of the aggregate shocks and of capital rental prices, which are common to all agents, as well as the idiosyncratic elements of the state space associated with the decision problem of each agent in the economy (age, schooling, work experience in each sector-occupation, preference, and skill shocks) will determine equilibrium skill rental prices. Specifically equilbirium skill rental prices equate aggregate skill supplies and demands in all sector-occupations.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Skill Prices~…researchers assume that the equilibrium skill rental price process governs the choices made by all individuals age 16-65 through the year 2050. This assumption is necessary to solve the optimization problems for individuals age 16 to 65 as of the year 2000. 
160~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived variable~Equilibrium Skill Prices~"…to accommodate the difference in national income and GDP by the level of business taxes, researchesr deflate the previously defined gross skill rental price for each sector-occupation by the ratio of NI to GDP. This adjustment assumes that labor and capital share equally in taxes. Note that the marginal product of skill for each sector-occupation is still net equal to its ""gross"" rental price, although individuals only receive the net rental price as disposable income."
160~D2, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Factor-Biased Technological Change~…factor-biased technological change are assumed to be time-varying.
160~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Current Skill Prices~…specifies for the current skill rental price as included in an information set variable used to compute the maximized lifetime utility.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Service Sector~…the service sector consists of the transportation and public utilities, trade, finance, insurance, real estate, private household service, miscellaneous service, and public administration industry categories.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Service Sector~…the service sector has historically been more female intensive than the goods sector, and has remained so. Indeed, the service sector is now majority female, having increased from 43% of the workforce in 1968 to 53% in 2000.
160~DV30~L8~Variable Value~Attend School~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual attended school.
160~DV30~L8~Variable Value~Attend School~…an individual is assigned to the school attendance alternative if he or she reported that schooling was his or her major activity during the survey week (CPS) or if he or she were attending school as of May 1 of the calendar year (NLSY79).
160~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~Elasticity of Substitution Between Capital and White-Collar Skill by Sector~…the elasticity of substitution between capital and white-collar skill (0.98 in the service sector and 1.13 in the goods sector) is less than that between the composite capital-white collar skill and the pink- or blue-collar skill (1.34 in the service sector and 1.22 in the goods sector) in both sectors.
160~V25~L9~Variable Value~Blue-Collar~…blue-collar occupations include craftsmen, operatives, and laborers.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV15~Derived Variable~Fertility Transition Probabilities~…the fertility transition probabilities are the sample transition rates within the following categories: individual ages between 16 and 65 by sex by four education categories (completed schooling less than 12, exactly 12, 13-15, and 16 and over) and by single years between 1901 and 2000. Before 1960 it is not conditioned on education.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV15~Derived Variable~Fertility Transition Probabilities~…the transitions are based on decennial census data from 1910, 1940, 1950, and 1960, and on Current Population Survey data from 1964 on.
160~D1, D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Goods Sector Real Productivity~…sector-specific real productivity is subject to shocks, that, evaulated at constant dollars, are assumed to follow a joint first-order vector autoregressive process in growth rates.
160~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…source of data on sectoral output and capital.
160~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…the data on output and capital come from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
160~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…this data source provides information on sectoral capital stocks and on output from 1947 to 2000.
160~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…the rental price of capital, to which the marginal product of capital in each sector is equated, is calculated from BEA data as the ratio of real capital income to the capital stock.
160~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…combining Current Population Survey data on wages and Bureau of Economic Analysis data on capital and output without adjustment would lead to potential biases in the estimates of factor shares in GDP for three reasons. First, national income and GDP differ by the level of business taxes. SEcond, total wage compensation derived from the CPS is les than that derived from the BEA. Third, wages do not reflect total labor compensation. Researchers augment CPS wages with BEA data on nonwage benefits in carrying out the estimation.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Service Sector~…each sector of the two-sector economy produces output using three skill categories of workers - white-, pink-, and blue-colllar, and homogeneous capital.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…it is assumed that the solution for the grwoth rate of equilbrium skill rental prices can be approximated by a log-log growth rate function.
160~D4~D4~Dataset~Census~…data on employment and earnings before 1970 are from decennial United States Censuses.
160~D4~D4~Dataset~Census~…dataset from which fertility transition probabilities are derived for the years 1910, 1940, 1950, and 1960.
160~D4~D4~Dataset~Census~…various United States Censuses from 1910 to 1960 provides information on the age 16 (initial) schooling distributions over time and on the preschool children process.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…the log-log growth rate function used in computing this growth rate assumes that the contemporaneous growth rate of sector-specific productivity shocks and a one-period lag in the growth rate of sector-occupation-specific equilibrium skill rental prices are sufficient to capture the histories of aggregate shocks and the state space distribution of the agents in the economy.
160~D2, D4~DV18~Derived Variable~Hicks-Neutral Technological Change~…Hicks-neutral technological change are assumed to be time-varying.
160~D1, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Individual Type~…the population consists of four types of individuals, where a type is distinguished by their endowment of each sector-occupation-specific skill and their consumption values of schooling and home.
160~D1, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Individual Type~…the probability that an individual is of a given type depends on the individual's sex and on the level of schooling completed at age 16 (initial schooling). The proportion of types in the population, therefore, varies over time as the initial schooling distribution changes.
160~D1, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Individual Type~…the population consists of H discrete types of individuals who permanently differ in preferences and skill endowments as described below..
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Aggregate Production Function for the Goods Sector~…the aggregate production functions for the goods sector is Constant Elasticity of Substitution with constant returns to scale in three skill types (white-, pink-, and blue-collar occupations) and capital.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Service Sector~…each sector is subject to an aggregate productivity shock.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Aggregate Production Function for the Goods Sector~…production in each sector is subject to constant returns to scale.
160~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Individual's Type Probability~…the probability that an individual is of any given type depends on the individual's initial conditions, namely the level of schooling attained at age 16 and gender
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~F14~Findings~Skill-Biased Technological Change by Sector~…researchers find there to be skill-biased technological change in both sectors, although it takes a slightly different form in the two sectors. In the goods sector, the marginal product of white-collar skill in the white-collar-capital skill composite is increasing over time, while in the service sector, it is the marginal product of the composite skill that is increasing.
160~D1, D3~F15~Findings~Home Alternative Utility Value by Gender~…the value of the home alternatives is about the same for men and women who have no children under the age of 6, but the presence of a child under the age of 6 increases the value of being home by 10 times more for women than for men.
160~D1, D3~F16~Findings~Mobility Cost Across Sectors and Occupations for Males~…the cost of moving between sectors within the same occupation is estimated to be significantly larger than moving between occupations within the same sector. For example, for males the cost of moving from any occupation in the goods sector to the same occupation in the service sector is $9,655, which is similar in magnitude for the reverse sector move ($9,305). However, the cost of changing occupations within a sector ranges only between $3,000 and $7,000.
160~D1, D3~F17~Findings~Mobility Cost Across Sectors and Occupations for Females~…for females, the cost of changing sectors, but remaining in the same occupation, is about $7,000 and the cost of changing occupations within a sector ranges mostly between $1,000 and $5,000.
160~D1, D3~F18~Findings~Fixed Cost of Labor Force Entry by Gender~…there is a substantial fixed cost of entering employment, similar in magnitude for men and women, and ranging from $10,688 for women who enter employment from school to $15,528 for men who enter employment from home.
160~D1, D3~F19~Findings~Additional Year of Schooling and White-Collar Skill by Sector~…estimates suggest that an additional year of schooling increases white-collar skill by 1.80% more in the service sector than in the goods sector. 
160~D1, D2, D3~F2~Findings~Growth Rate in Service-Sector Output Relative to Goods-Sector Output~…although the growth rate in service-sector output relative to goods-sector output (in constant dollars) was monotonic, it accelerated after 1980. Between 1968 and 1980, the value of service-sector output in constant dollars grew by 1.26% per year more than the value of goods-sector output, while between 1981 and 2000 the differential growth rate was 2.51% per year. However, this pattern resulted from relative price changes. Over the entire relevant period, the growth of service-sector output in physical units, that is, defined as nominal output divided by its sector specific price, exceeded the same measure of growth of goods-sector output by 1.62 percentage points. Moreover, the relative service-to-goods sector output in this measure grew faster in the first period than in the second, by 2.91 vs. 0.79 percentage points.
160~D1, D3~F20~Findings~Weights on Occupation-Specific Work Experience~...the difference in the weights on occupation-specific work experience are large. In particular, the weights on white-collar goods-sector work experience in the goods- and service-sector composites are 0.058 and 0.015, the weights on pink-collar goods-sector work experience in the goods- and service-sector composites are 0.021 and 0.005, and the weights on blue-collar goods-sector work experience in the goods- and service-sector composites are 0.014 and 0.004.
160~D2~V11~Variable~Discount Factor~…the discount factor in the economy as included in computing an individual's maximized lifetime utility.
160~D2~V11~Variable~Discount Factor~…researchers do not estimate the subjective discount factor, which, in prior partial equilibrium structural estimation problems, has proven difficult to pin down. It is instead fixed at 0.95, a 5% discount rate, which is close to the implied interest rate given that the rental price of capital (relative to the price of capital) in the data is 0.15 and given a 10% annual depreciation rate.
160~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Individual's Type Probability~…the probability distribution of the H types is discrete: an individual's type probability depends on sex and initial (age 16) completed schooling, specifically whether the individual had completed 10 or more years.
160~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Individual's Type Probability~…type probabilities are time-varying to the extent that the initial schooling distribution has changed.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample population at any calendar time consists of overlapping generations of individuals of both sexes age 16 to 65 and is time-varying. The population consists of four types of individuals, where a type is distinguished by their endowment of each sector-occupation-specific skill and their consumption values of schooling and home.

160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…dataset from which fertility transition probabilities are derived for the year 1964.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the March Current Population Surveys over the period 1968 to 2001 provides information on life cycle employment and schooling, and on wages.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from the CPS provides information on the age 16 (initial) schooling distributions over time and on the preschool children process.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the 33 years of Current Population Survey data span cohorts born as early as 1903 and as late as 1984 during some period of their lifetimes between the ages of 16 and 65. Although this data can be used to caluclate the choice distributions for those cohorts and ages, being primarily a cross-sectional data set, it does not contain a history of employment choices that would enable the calculation of work experience.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…combining Current Population Survey data on wages and Bureau of Economic Analysis data on capital and output without adjustment would lead to potential biases in the estimates of factor shares in GDP for three reasons. First, national income and GDP differ by the level of business taxes. SEcond, total wage compensation derived from the CPS is les than that derived from the BEA. Third, wages do not reflect total labor compensation. Researchers augment CPS wages with BEA data on nonwage benefits in carrying out the estimation.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source contains the necessary information to compute the proportion of individuals choosing each of the eight alternatives by year (1968-2000), age (16-65), and sex.
160~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source contains the necessary information to compute the mean log hourly real wage by the six sector-occupation categories, year and sex, the mean log hourly real wage by highest grade completed, year, and sex, the mean log hourly real wage by year, age, and sex, the mean 1-year difference in the log hourly real wage by current and 1-year lagged sector-occupation, and by sex, the mean 1-year difference in the log hourly real wage by age, current sector-occupation, and sex, the variance in the log hourly real wage by education, sex, and year, and the variance in the log hourly real wage by sector-occupation, sex, and year.

160~D1~V12~Variable~Education~…four education categories used in determining fertility transition probability differences.
160~D1, D2, D4~F21~Findings~Additional Year of Schooling by Sector and Occupation~…an additional year of schooling increases skill (and thus the wage) in the goods and service sector by 5.4% and 7.6% in white-collar occupations, by 4.6% and 4.7% in pink-collar occupations, and by 2.7% and 4.4% in blue-collar occupations.
160~D1~V12~Variable~Education~…specifies for an individual's completed years of education as included in an information set variable used to compute the maximized lifetime utility.
160~D1~V13~Variable~Employment~…an individual is defined as employed if he or she worked at least 39 weeks a year and 20 hours per week. None of the employment patterns would be significantly altered if this restriction was dropped or if annual hours was the measure of employment.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV21~Derived Variable~Information Set~…the information set included in calculating an individual's lifetime utility consists of current indiosyncratic shocks, years of education and work experience, current and past skill rental prices, current and past aggregate shocks, and the current and past ages of preschool children, as well as other information used to forecast future rental prices.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV22~Derived Variable~Lifetime Utility~…each individual alive at time t maximizes the remaining expected discounted present value of lifetime utility given their age by choosing among the eight alternatives.
160~D1, D2, D4~DV22~Derived Variable~Lifetime Utility~…maximized expected lifetime utility of an individual who is at a certain age and time dependent on the discount factor and the information set (or state space) at age a and time t. 
160~D1, D2, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Mobility Cost~…transitioning between sector-occupation alternatives involves a mobility cost.
160~D1, D2, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Mobility Cost~…parameters that reflect a direct cost of switching from any of the eight alternatives to any of the six employment alternatives, as included in computing an individual's budget constraint.
160~D1, D4~V14~Variable~Fertility~…note that fertility is determined by the current level of completed schooling, which depends on prior choices.

160~D1, D2, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Mobility Cost~…the cost of changing both sector and occupation is the sum of changing sectors with the same occupation and changing occupations within the sector. The cost of moving from home or school to employment is independent of sector and occupation.
160~D1, D3~F22~Findings~Own vs. Other Sector-Occupation Experience~…own sector-occupation experience increases skill more than experience obtained in other sector-occupations. For example, for goods-sector white-collar skill, the weight on white-collar experience gained in the goods sector is 2.8 times larger than the weight on pink-collar experience gained in that sector and 4.1 times larger than the weight on blue-collar experience. For service-sector white-collar skill, the weight on white-collar experience gained in the service sector is 4.7 times larger than the weight on pink-collar experience gained in that sector and 8.0 times larger than the weight on blue-collar experience.
160~D1, D2, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Mobility Cost~…the cost of switching sectors can be as high as 75% of average annual earnings over the 1968 to 2000 period.

160~D2, D4~DV24~Derived Variable~Preference Shocks~…preference shocks are joint normal with elements of the variance-covariance matrix.
160~D2, D4~DV25~Derived Variable~Product Supply~…product supply shifts because there are technological changes in each sector.
160~D2, D4~DV25~Derived Variable~Product Supply~…exogenous changes in the relative price of goods to services and in the rental price of capital directly affect product supplies and factor demands. 
160~D1, D3, D4~DV26~Derived Variable~Proportion of Service Workers~…the proportion of workers employed in the service sector.
160~V12~L10~Variable Value~Exactly 12~…one of four education categories indicating that a respondent completed exactly 12 years of schooling.

160~D1, D3~DV27~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…the hourly wage is based on the individuals assigned work category, i.e. his or her industry and occupation held during the year (CPS) or on the most recent job (NLSY79).
160~D1, D3~F23~Findings~Occupational Experience and Sectoral Transferability I~…experience obtained in a given occupation is more transferable between sectors than experience obtained in a different occupation. For example, in the case of service-sector white-collar skill, the weight on white-collar experience gained in the goods sector is 0.022, but the weights on pink- and blue-collar experience obtained in the goods sector are 0.005 and 0.003.
160~DV30~L11~Variable Value~GB~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual works in the goods-sector blue-collar occupation.
160~D3~V17~Variable~Initial Experience~…by assumption, youths have zero work experience at age 16. Researchers also assumed that youths who were age 17 or 18 in 1979 also had zero years of work experience.
160~D3~V17~Variable~Initial Experience~…specifies for an individual's completed years of work experience as included in an information set variable used to compute the maximized lifetime utility.
160~D1, D3~F24~Findings~Occupational Experience and Sectoral Transferability II~…experience gained in a given occupation is not uniformly more or less transferable between sectors than is experience gained in a different occupation within the same sector. For example, in the case of white-collar service-sector skill, white-collar experience gained in the goods sector has a higher weight (0.022) than does pink-collar experience gained in the service sector (0.017). However, this is not the case for white-collar goods-sector skill, where white-collar experience gained in the service sector has a lower weight (0.015) than does pink collar experience gained in the goods sector (0.021) and essentially the same weight as blue-collar experience gained in the goods sector (0.014).
160~D3~V18~Variable~Initial Schooling~…school attainment at age 16.
160~D3~V18~Variable~Initial Schooling~…changes over time in school attainment at age 16 (initial schooling) may also have affected the skill distribution in ways that influenced the growth in the service sector.

160~D1, D3, D4~V19~Variable~Labor Supply~…changes over time in female labor supply arise in the model because of changes in fertility (considered exogenous) by cohort and the effect that children have on the value of female home time. 
160~D2, D4~DV28~Derived Variable~Relative Goods-to-Service Product Price~…the relative goods-to-service product price is taken as exogenous to the United States economy.
160~DV30~L11~Variable Value~GP~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual works in the goods-sector pink-collar occupation.

160~D2, D4~DV28~Derived Variable~Relative Goods-to-Service Product Price~…periods of a rising relative price of services to goods would induce faster relative growth in service-sector output and employment.
160~D1, D3~DV29~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…in this paper, researchers assess whether or not the constancy of the relative wage implies that individuals face small direct psychic or monetary costs of switching sectors.
160~D1, D3~DV29~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…in this paper, researchers assess whether relative wage constancy implies that work experience is highly substitutable between sectors.
160~D1, D3~DV29~Derived Variable~Relative Wage~…within occupations the differential perentage changes in relative wages tend to be much smaller than for all occupations together.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Production Function for the Service Sector~…the aggregate production functions for the service sector is Constant Elasticity of Substitution with constant returns to scale in three skill types (white-, pink-, and blue-collar occupations) and capital.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Production Function for the Service Sector~…specifically, production at time t, valued at the sector's period t real price, is given by the nested CES function.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Aggregate Production Function for the Service Sector~…production in each sector is subject to constant returns to scale.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~F25~Findings~Adjusted R-Squared for Penultimate Period Regressions~..the adjusted R-squared, based on the one-step-ahead forecast of the rental prices obtained in the last round of iterations of the solution algorithm using the parameter estimates for the skill rental price process estimated in the penultimate iteration round are 0.98, 0.98, 0.87, 0.98, 0.98, and 0.92. Although these are high in some absolute sense, it is not clear how the predictions of the model, and the estimates that results, would differ from the true rational expectations equilibrium.
160~DV30~L13~Variable Value~GW~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual works in the goods-sector white-collar occupation.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Sector-Occupation Alternatives~…individuals age 16 to 65 choose among eight discrete alternatives at each age, working in any of the six sector-occupations, attending school, or remaining in the home sector.
160~D1, D3~F26~Findings~Ratio of Predicted to Actual Relative Hourly Wage~…except for the earliest period, from 1968-1974, the ratio of the predicted to actual relative hourly wage ranges from 0.90 to 0.95.
160~DV30~L14~Variable Value~Home Sector~…the age-invariant nonpecuniary payoff to remaining in the home sector depends on the number of preschool children in the household.

160~DV30~L14~Variable Value~Home Sector~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual took leisure (neither worked nor attended school).
160~DV30~L14~Variable Value~Home Sector~…an individual who is neither attending school nor at work is assigned to the home category.
160~D1, D3~L15~Variable Value~Home Sector Utility~…particularly because females are less likely to work when there are young children in the household, the utility associated with being at home is allowed to depend on the number of children under the age of six and, to better fit persistence in the home alternative, on whether the individual was at home in the previous period.
160~D1, D3~F27~Findings~Proportion of New Entrants over the Relevant Periods~…in the data, the share of new workers (age 18-24) employed in the service sector rose by 13.6 percentage points from the periods 1968-1974 to 1996-2000 (from 0.628 to 0.764). The model predicts an increase over the same period of 8.6 percentage points (0.657 to 0.743). The actual and predicted increase for each of the following age groups are 14.4 vs. 8.9 for ages 25 to 31, 12.4 vs. 12.1 for ages 32 to 38, 11.6 vs. 15.5 for ages 39 to 45, 13.9 vs. 12.7 for ages 46 to 52, 12.3 vs. 12.9 for ages 53 to 59, and 10.4 vs. 6.9 for ages 60 and over.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Sector-Occupation Alternatives~…there is an age-invariant nonpecuniary payoff to each sector-occupation and a stochastic consumption value of attending school and of remaining in the home sector.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Sector-Occupation Alternatives~…the specification of the choice model follows closely that of Keane and Wolpin (1997).
160~D1, D3, D4~DV31~Derived Variable~Sector-Occupation-Specific Composite Work Experience~"…sector-occupation-specific ""composite"" work experience is a sector-occupation-specific weighted sum of work experience across all sector-occupation. Thus, in addition to the direct mobility cost associated with switching employment to a different sector-occupation, there is also a loss to the extent that the accumulated work experience in the origin sector produces less composite work experience in the destination sector, that is, there is a loss of specific human capital."
160~D1, D3, D4~DV32~Derived Variable~Sector-Occupation-Specific Skill~…this measure depends on the individual's level of schooling in that period and the individual's accumulated work experience in each sector-occupation.
160~D1, D3, D4~DV32~Derived Variable~Sector-Occupation-Specific Skill~…there are six skill types of labor, three within each of the two production sectors.
160~D1, D3, D4~DV32~Derived Variable~Sector-Occupation-Specific Skill~…the rate at which individuals accumulate sector-occupation-specific skill depends on their initial endowments of each skill and on the history of their choices.
160~D1, D3, D4~DV32~Derived Variable~Sector-Occupation-Specific Skill~…for any given (birth) cohort, there is an age-dependent distribution of potential supplies of the six types of skill.
160~D2, D4~V2~Variable~Aggregate Demand for Capital~…the aggregate demand for capital is equal to the sum of demand in the two sectors.
160~D1, D3~V20~Variable~Number of Preschool Children~…the number of preschool children, ages 0 to 5, assumed above to affect the value of leisure, is taken to be exogenous and can be any one of three values, 0, 1, or 2 or more.
160~D1, D3~V20~Variable~Number of Preschool Children~…transitions from one value to another are governed by a transition probability function that depends on the individual's age, sex, education, and birth cohort.

160~V12~L17~Variable Value~Less than 12~…one of four education categories indicating that a respondent completed less than 12 years of schooling.
160~D2, D4~DV33~Derived Variable~Service Sector Growth~…in this paper, researchers assess the causes of the growth of the service sector, parceling out the factors responsible into those that originate in labor supply shifts and those in labor demand shifts.
160~D2, D4~DV34~Derived Variable~Service Sector Real Productivity~…sector-specific real productivity is subject to shocks, that, evaulated at constant dollars, are assumed to follow a joint first-order vector autoregressive process in growth rates.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~…researchers assume that the solution for the growth rate of equilibrium skill rental prices can be approximated by a log-log growth rate function; the methodology of approximating a rational expectations equilibrium process combines ideas in Krusell and Smith (1998) and Altug and Miller (1998). Krusell and Smith use moments of the aggregate distribution of the state space elements in the forecasting rule as an approximation to the rational expectations equilibrium for which they solve, while Altug and Miller assume a Markov process for the forecasting rule of the equilibrium price in their model, but do not explicitly solve the equilibrium.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~…although in the growth rate solution algorithm researchers treat the parameters as unrestricted, they are in fact themselves functions of the underlying parameters of the model.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~…in implementing the solution algorithm, researchers assume the economy begins in 1860 (t=1). Researchers observe the age distribution of the population at that time. Although researchers do not have data on the state space of agents alive in 1860 or on actual sectoral output and the rental price of capital that are needed for the algorithm, for the purpose of describing the algorith, it is assumed that they do. It turns out that the solution of the model for the periods that the model is fitted to actual data (1968-2000) is not sensitive to the assumptions that are made.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~…given model parameters, a discount factor, and observed sequences of output in each sector and of the rental price of capital, the algorithm consists of the following steps: 1. Choose a set of parameters for the equilibrium rental price process and for the aggregate shock process. 2. Solve the optimization problem for each cohort that exists from t = 1 through t = T. The maximization problem can be cast as a finite horizon dynamic programming problem. The value function can be written as the maximum over alternative-specific value functions, i.e., the expected discounted value of a choice-alternative, that satisfy the Bellman equation. 3. Guess an initial set of values for period one rental prices. Given the age distribution and the distribution of state variables for each cohort alive at the time and between the ages of 16 and 65, simulate a sample of agents' chosen alternatives at t=1 by drawing from the distribution of the idiosyncratic shocks to preferences and skills. Calculate the aggregate skill levels in each sector-occupation. 4. Given aggregate skill supplies, equate the marginal product of capital in each of the two sectors to the rental price of capital which is data. Using these two equations and the two production functions with actual output in the two sectors as the left-hand side quantity, solve the four equations for the optimal capital input in each sector and for the two aggregate shocks. The marginal product of the aggregate skill quantities, evaluated at the levels in step 3 and the capital stocks and aggregate shocks calculated in step 4 will in general differ from the initial guesses. 5. Update the initial guesses for the skill rental prices to be equal to the marginal products of aggregate skills. Repeat steps 3 and 4 using the updated skill rental price as the guess in step 3, until the sequences of skill rental prices and aggregate shocks converge. 6. Guess an initial set of values for period two rental prices. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for t=2 to obtain new equilibrium prices. 7. Repeat steps 6 for t=3,...,T. 8. Using the calculated series of equilibrium skill rental prices and aggregate shocks, estimate the VAR that governs aggregate shocks and the growth rate of equilibrium skill prices, the process that governs the equilibrium skill rental prices. 9. using these estimates, repeat steps 2 through 8 until the series of skill rental prices and aggregate shocks converge.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~…the model for growth rates of equilibrium skill rental prices is solved as if the world began in 1860. In solving the model, researchers assign arbitrary values for the state space to each person age 16 to 65 in 1860, zero work experience in each sector-occupation, and 8 years of schooling. Researchers also assume that the capital real rental price, cohort size, real output in the two sectors, and the fertility process between 1860 and 1900 are the same as in 1900. Researchers extrapolate sectoral output backward from 1947, assume that the real rental price of capital is constant between 1900 and 1925, and allow cohort size to change as it actually did after 1900.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~...researchers solve the optimization problem for the 65-year-old in 2050, 64- and 65-year-olds in 2049, etc. Between 1860 and 2000, the optimization problem is solved for the full age distribution of 16 to 65 years.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Log-Log Growth Rate~"…to circumvent the ""curse of dimensionality"", researchers adopt an approximation method in which the Emax functions are expressed as a parametric function of the state variables using methods developed in Keane and Wolpin (1994, 1997). In particular, the Emax functions are calculated at a subset of the state points and their values are used to fit a linear-in-parameters regression approximation in the state variables. The multivariate integrations necessary to calculate the expected value of the maximume of the alternative-specific value functions at those state points are performed by Monte Carlo integration over the shocks. In this case, the integrations are performed over both idiosyncratic shocks and aggregate shocks."
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV35~Derived Variable~Skill Based Production Function~…there is a production function for each type of skill included in the model.
160~D2, D4~DV36~Derived Variable~Skill Demand~…demand for skill types is determined by their respective marginal revenue products.
160~D2, D4~DV36~Derived Variable~Skill Demand~…factor demand shifts because there are technological changes in each sector.
160~D2, D4~DV36~Derived Variable~Skill Demand~…exogenous changes in the relative price of goods to services and in the rental price of capital directly affect product supplies and factor demands. 
160~D2, D4~DV36~Derived Variable~Skill Demand~…a declining rental price of capital would increase the demand for capital relatively more in the capital intensive sector, as well as increasing the demand for complementary inputs, that is, for higher skill occupations if there is capital-skill complementarity.
160~D2, D4~DV36~Derived Variable~Skill Demand~…given the static nature of the demand side of the model, aggregate skill demand for each sector-occupation is determined by equating the marginal revenue product of aggregate skill for each sector occupation to its current (equilibrium) skill rental price.
160~D2, D4~DV36~Derived Variable~Skill Demand~…at each time t, the six excess demand functions are dependent on the vector of current and past productivity shocks, the vector of the current and past capital rental prices, the state space vector at time t over all agents in the economy, and the set of model parameters.
160~D1, D3~DV37~Derived Variable~Skill Supply~…because of variations in cohort size, the environment considered is not stationary in terms of the age distribution of the population; thus, the potential supply of sector-occupation skills varies with calendar time and may provide a part of the explanation for relative service-sector grwoth.
160~D1, D3, D4~F28~Findings~Service-Sector Employment Share by Age~…service-sector employment share of the cohort that was 18 to 24 years old in the period 1975 to 1981 increased by 6.3 percentage points from their entry to age 39 to 45 (from 0.662 to 0.725), while the model prediction is an increase of 7.0 percentage points (from 0.664 to 0.734).
160~D1, D3, D4~F29~Findings~Service-Sector Employment Share by Gender~…among men who choose to work, the proportion choosing to work in the service sector is 0.85 for those who worked in the service sector the previous period, 0.19 for those who worked in the goods sector the previous period, and 0.58 for those who were not working the previous period. The corresponding predictions of the model are 0.93, 0.13, and 0.57. For females, the actual and predicted values are 0.94, 0.22, and 0.83 versus 0.96, 0.20, and 0.76.
160~D1, D3~V24~Variable~Wage Offer~…an individual receives a wage offer in each period from each sector and in each occupation.
160~D1, D3~V24~Variable~Wage Offer~…researchers adopt a Ben-Porath-Griliches specification of the wage function. Each sector-occupation-specific wage offer is the product of a sector-occupation-specific competitively determined skill rental prices and the amount of sector-occupation-specific skill units possessed by the individual.
160~D1, D3, D4~F3~Findings~Differential Rate of Growth in the Service Sector~…the increase in the differential rate of growth of the value of service-sector ouput between 1968-1980 and 1981-2000 periods was mirrored by an even larger change in the relative rate of growth of capital allocated to the service sector. In the first period, the annual growth rate of capital was 0.67% less in the service sector, but 1.51% per year more in the second period. On the other hand, the relative rate of growth in service-sector employment was slighly greater in the first period, 2.45% per year, than in the second, 2.09% per year.
160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…source of data on employment transitions.
160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudial Surveys of Labor Market Experience follows a national random sample of individuals plus an oversample by race of about 12,000 individuals from the 1957 to 1964 birth cohorts.

160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…a longitudinal data set that surveys cohorts born from 1957 to 1964 annually from 1979 to the present. Researchesr use this data source to calculate moments that represent or are conditioned on occupation and sector-specific work experience.
160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…this data source contains the necessary information to compute the proportion of individuals choosing each of the eight alternatives by age (16-30), sex, and initial schooling level at age 16, the proportion of individuals choosing each of the six work alternatives by experience, sector-occupation, and sex.
160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…the sample drawn from this data is restricted to those respondents who are less than 18 years old in 1979, currently age at least 18, and working.
160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…this data source contains the necessary information to compute the mean log hourly real wage by work experience, sector-occupation, and sex.
160~D3~D3~Dataset~NLSY79~…this data source contains the necessary information to compute the distribution of years of work experience in each sector for individuals between the ages of 29 to 31 and the years 1990 to 1993, the distribution of occupation-specific work experience for individuals between the ages of 29 to 31 and the years 1990 to 1993, and the distribution of the number of years of not working for individuals between the ages of 29 to 31 and the years 1990 to 1993, by sex.
160~D1, D3~V24~Variable~Wage Offer~…to improve the fit of wage profiles, a linear age effect is introduced upon reaching age 40.
160~D1, D3~V24~Variable~Wage Offer~…an individual receives a stochastic wage offer from each sector occupation in each period that is the product of a competitively determined sector-occupation-specific skill rental price and the individual's accumulated sector-occupation-specific skill.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Sector-Occupation Alternatives~…at each age, from 16 to 65, an individual of a certain type who is alive at time t chooses among eight mutually exclusive alternatives, each denoted by a dichotomous variable equal to 1 when a certain alternative is chosen and 0 otherwise.
160~D1, D2, D4~F30~Findings~Average Goods-Sector Output vs. Average Service Sector Output~…actual average goods-sector output (in constant dollars) was 18% higher during the period 1975 to 1979 than in 1968, service-sector output was 139% higher, and the service-sector share of output was 0.67.
160~D1, D2, D3~F31~Findings~Counterfactual Experiment 1 and Sectoral Output~…in the most restrictive counterfactual, in which there is essentially no intersectoral mobility, output in the goods sector falls by 70% in the first period and never exceeds 65% of base year output in future periods. Average service-sector share of output was 66% in the 1968 to 1974 period (both actual and predicted) and 77% in the 1995 to 2000 period (both actual and predicted, suggesting that that the service-sector ouput falls in the base period, but proportionately less than goods-sector output. The share in the 1968 to 1974 period is 78% and in the 1995 to 2000 period is 87%.
160~D1, D3~DV37~Derived Variable~Skill Supply~…changes in skill supply may also have accompanied the increase in female labor force participation, because females are modeled as having potentially different skill ednowments and preferences.
160~D1, D3~DV38~Derived Variable~Skill Units~…skill units of each worker category (occupation) employed in each sector are additive over workers in that occupation and sector.
160~D1, D3~DV38~Derived Variable~Skill Units~…skill units are produced through formal education and through work experience accumulated in each sector-occupation, and are subject to idiosyncratic i.i.d. shocks.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV39~Derived Variable~State Space Distribution~..the state space vector at time t over all agents in the economy as included in determining the six excess demand functions.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV39~Derived Variable~State Space Distribution~…dependent on the joint population distribution of schooling, sector-occupation-specific work experience, and number of children under 6 years old). 
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV39~Derived Variable~State Space Distribution~…the state space at age a and time t for each individual consists of all current and past values of the six skill rental prices and the sector-specific productivity shocks, education, accumulated work experience in each sector-occupation, the number of children under the age of 6, and the previous period's choice.
160~D1, D2, D3~F32~Findings~Counterfactual Experiment 1 and Share of Capital~…in the most restrictive counterfactual, in which there is essentially no intersectoral mobility, the average service-sector share of capital in the 1968-1974 period, 80%, is 88% in the experiment. In the latest period, the comparable figures are 83% and 91%.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Sector-Occupation Alternatives~…to accommodate the fact that individuals do not necessarily engage in the same activity over an entire calendar year, the choice variables are defined according to a hierarchical rule.
160~D1, D3~V25~Variable~Sector-Occupation Alternatives~…the work alternative is assigned to those not attending schol who worked at least 39 weeks and at least 20 hours per week during the calendar year. When the individual is assigned to the work category, his or her industry and occupation is that of the job held during the year (CPS) or on the most recent job (NLSY79).
160~D1, D3, D4~V3~Variable~Aggregate Skill Supply~…aggregate skill supplied to each sector-occupation is the sum of the skill units of the individuals who choose that alternative.
160~V25~L18~Variable Value~Pink-Collar~…pink-collar occupations include clerical, secretarial, and sales categories.
160~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Aggregate Productivity Shock~…the goods producing sector and service sector are each subject to an aggregate productivity shock.
160~D1, D4~DV40~Derived Variable~Terminal Period Probability~…the terminal period, i.e. the retirement age, is probabilistic starting from age 61; the probability increases linearly until age 64 and is 1 at age 65.
160~D1, D3, D4~V3~Variable~Aggregate Skill Supply~…this measure highlights the dependence of current choices on the set of six skill rental prices.
160~D2, D4~V4~Variable~Aggregate Supply of Capital~…the aggregate supply of capital is perfectly elastic at the current rental price of capital.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV41~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Factor Shares~…time-varying factor shares, reflecting biased technological change, are assumed to be constant up to 1960, then to follow separate linear trends until 1980, and then different linear trends thereafter.
160~D2, D4~DV42~Derived Variable~VAR Growth Rates~…real productivity shocks, evaluated at constant dollars, are assumed to follow a joint first-order vector autoregressive (VAR) process in growth rates where the innovations are joint normal with the elements of the variance-covariance matrix.
160~D1, D3~F33~Findings~Counterfactual Experiment 1 and Share of Employment~…in the most restrictive counterfactual, in which there is essentially no intersectoral mobility, the average service-sector share of employment in the first period is 76% under the experiment as compared to the model prediction of 62%; comparable figures for the later period are 86% and 73%.
160~D1, D3, D4~F34~Findings~Counterfactual Experiment 2 and Fraction of Working Individuals~…when counterfactual experiment 2 is implemented, the fraction of individuals working over all periods and ages falls from 57% to 38% due to the mobility restrictions.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV43~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…the methodology of approximating a rational expectations equilbrium process combines ideas in Krusell and Smith (1998) and Altug and Miller (1998). Krussell and Smith use moments of the aggregate distribution of the state space elements in the forecasting rule as an approximation to the rational expectations equilibrium for which they solve, while Altug and Miller assume a Markov process for the forecasting rule of the equilibrium price in their model, but do not explicitly solve the equilibrium.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV43~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…note that, given this approximation of growth rates, researchers remain agnostic as to what individuals know about future technological change or about the values of other future exogenous variables (for example, the rental price of capital, relative product prices, etc.).
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV43~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…one approximation error in computing this growth rate is that the environment is explicitly nonstationary, allowing for nonconstancy in the growth of population (and the related time-varying fertility process for the number of children under 6).
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV43~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…this representation of the rental price process reduces the state space of the agents' optimization problem to only the one- and two-period lags in rental prices and the one-period lag in aggregate shcoks.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV43~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…researchers assume that the equilibrium skill rental price process governs the choices made by all individuals age 16-65 through the year 2050. This assumption is necessary to solve the optimization problems for individuals age 16 to 65 as of the year 2000. 
160~D1, D3, D4~F35~Findings~Counterfactual Experiment 2 and New Entrant Sectoral Propensity~…when counterfactual experiment 2 is implemented, among those new entrants choosing to work, between 84% and 89% chose the service sector over the 1968 to 2000 period, while the figure for the actual economy (as predicted by the model) is between 66% and 74%. At the same input usage as in 1968, the estimates imply that service-sector output would have increased by 48% more than goods sector ouput by 2000.
160~D1, D3~F36~Findings~Counterfactual Experiment 3 and Sectoral Employment~…when counterfactual experiment 3 is implemented, goods-sector employment actually rises proportionately by slightly more than does service sector employment, leading to a small decrease in the service-sector share.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~F37~Findings~Counterfactual Experiements 7 and 8 and Sectoral Output~…allowing for cohort size changes after 1960 (experiment 7) and for those changes combined with fertility change (experiment 8), while expanding the size of the economy, leaves service-sector shares of output, capital and employment uncahnged. By themselves, these supply-side factors cannot account for any part of the relative growth of the service sector.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~F38~Findings~Counterfactual Experiments 9, 10, and 11 and Sectoral Output~…technological change (experiment 9) increased the service sector share of output, capital, and employment through the 1968 to 1984 period and then reduced the share, while price changes (experiment 10) reduced the service-sector shares up to that point and then increased the share. The combined effect (experiment 11) led to an increase in the service-sector share of output (employment) over the entire period from 0.46 (0.44) in 1968 to 1974 to 0.69 (0.67) in 1995 to 2000, a much larger percentage point increase than actually occured. Given these results, it appears that the growth of the service sector occured primarily because of demand-side changes.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV43~Derived Variable~Growth Rate of Equilibrium Skill Rental Prices~…there are six equilibrium skill rental price processes. They are intended to be approximations of those that would be the outcome if agents had rational expectations. Although researchers cannot do a direct comparison of the approximation to rational expectations, one could measure the degree to which these approximations are close to their rational expectations counterparts by looking at the adjusted R-squared of the regression used in solving them.
160~D1~DV43~Derived Variable~Variance in Log Hourly Real Wage, Education, Sex, Year~…the variance in the log hourly real wage by education, sex, and year.
160~D1, D3~F39~Findings~Individual and Aggregate Level Mobility cost~…at the individual level, the estimated direct mobility cost (psychic and monetary) ranged generally between 50% and 75% of average annual earnings. At the aggregate level, the estimates imply that, based on a counterfactual experiment, output in both sectors would have been double their current levels if these mobility costs had been zero.
160~DV30~L19~Variable Value~RB~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual works in the service-sector blue-collar occupation.
160~D1~DV43~Derived Variable~Variance in Log Hourly Real Wage, Education, Sex, Year~…researchers allow for lognormally distributed measurement error in the reported hourly wage rate.
160~D2, D4~DV44~Derived Variable~Sectoral Output~…output by sector is available starting in 1947. Researchers extrapolate sectoral output backward from that point in computing a log-log growth rate algorithm of the growth rate of equilibrium skill rental prices.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~F4~Findings~Service Sector Employment Growth Throughout the Relevant Period~…for the entire 1968 to 2000 period, service-sector employment grew 2.23% per year faster than did goods-sector employment, while the average hourly wage grew only by 0.23% faster. For the first subperiod, these figures were 2.45% and -0.17%, and for the second, 2.09% and 0.50%.
160~D1~DV44~Derived Variable~Variance in Log Hourly Real Wage, Sector-Occupation, Sex, Year~…the variance in the log hourly real wage by sector-occupation, sex, and year.
160~D1~DV44~Derived Variable~Variance in Log Hourly Real Wage, Sector-Occupation, Sex, Year~…researchers allow for lognormally distributed measurement error in the reported hourly wage rate.

160~D2, D4~DV46~Derived Variable~College Attendance Cost~…the estimated cost (tuition plus nontuition payments) of attending college is $18,664, and that of attending graduate school is $30,004.
160~DV30~L19~Variable Value~RP~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual works in the service-sector pink-collar occupation.
160~DV30~L19~Variable Value~RW~…a sector-occupation alternative specifying for whether an individual works in the service-sector white-collar occupation.
160~D2~V5~Variable~Capital~…capital and white-collar skill form a nested CES composite input.
160~D1, D3~V6~Variable~Cohort size~…because of variations in cohort size, the environment considered is not stationary in terms of the age distribution of the population.
160~D1, D3~V6~Variable~New Entrant Cohorts~…new entrant cohorts provide a source of flexibility in terms of entry into the sector in which there is increasing demand.
160~D1, D3~DV47~Derived Variable~Distribution of Education, Year, Age, Sex~…the distribution of highest grade completed by year (1968-2000), age (16-65), and sex.

160~D2~DV5~Derived variable~Price of Capital~…the rental price of capital, to which the marginal product of capital in each sector is equated, is calculated from BEA data as the ratio of real capital income to the capital stock.
160~D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Price of Capital~…the price of capital is taken as exogenous to the United States economy.
160~D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Price of Capital~…researchers assume that the real rental price of capital (and thus the real interest rate) is exogenous, that is, is set internationally and taken as given.
160~D1, D3~DV50~Derived Variable~Distribution of Sector-Specific Work Experience~…the distribution of years of work experience in each sector for individuals between the ages of 29 to 31 and the years 1990 to 1993.

160~D2, D4~V9~Variable~Current Aggregate Shocks~…specifies for current aggregate shocks as included in an information set variable used to compute the maximized lifetime utility.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~F40~Findings~Actual Service-Sector of Employment and Counterfactual Hypotheticals~…between 1968 and 2000, the service-sector share of employment rose by 17 percentage points (from 0.58 to 0.75). Counterfactual experiements indicated that if all else had remained the same at their 1960 levels except for supply-side factors, cohort size, and fertility, there would have been no change in the service-sector employment share over the period. On the other hand, had only demand factors, production technology, and product and capital prices changed since 1960, leaving the supply-side factors at their 1960 levels, the service-sector share of employment would have increased by 27 percentage points.
160~D1~DV53~Derived Variable~Mean Log Hourly Real Wage, Year, Age, Sex~…the mean log hourly real wage by year, age, and sex.
160~D1~DV54~Derived Variable~Mean Log Hourly Real Wage, Year, Sex~…the mean log hourly real wage by the six sector-occupation categories, year and sex.
160~D1, D3~F5~Findings~Relative Average Hourly Wage Growth Throughout the Relevant Period~…although the relative average hourly wage was essentially flat between 1968 and 1984 (0.96 in 1968 and 0.94 in 1984), there has been a more noticable rising trend in the relative hourly wage since then. The relative service-to-goods sector hourly wage rose from 0.94 in 1984 to 1.04 in 2000.
160~D1, D3~F6~Findings~Proportion of Sector-Specific White-Collar Workers~…the proportion of service-sector workers in white-collar occupations increased from 0.35 in 1968 to 0.41 in 2000 and the proportion of goods-sector workers in white-collar occupations increased from 0.17 in 1968 to 0.23 in 2000.
160~D1, D3~F7~Findings~Proportion of Sector-Specific New Entrants by Gender~…the proportion of new entrants, those age 18-24, who worked in the service sector increased from an average of 0.63 over the 1968 to 1974 period to 0.76 over the period 1996 to 2000, although the increase has slowed over the last two periods. The increase was similar for males and females: for males the increase was from 0.52 to 0.66 and for females, from 0.78 to 0.89.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…in this paper, researchers specify and estimate a two-sector labor market equilibrium model that allows them to address emperical issues related to relative wage constancy and service sector growth in a unified coherent framework.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…this model assumes a spot-market equilibrium for labor.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…researchers extend Heckman and Sedlacek's static model of sectoral choice in the presence of skill heterogeneity to a dynamic choice setting, incorporate many features of Rogerson's (1987) model of sectoral reallocation in the presence of productivity shocks and mobility costs, adopt the partial equilibrium dynamic schooling and occupational choice framework of Keane and Wolpin (1997), and extend the general equilibrium formulations of Lee (2005) and Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (1998) to allow for sectoral choice and aggregate shocks. Researchers also embed both supply and demand explanations for relative service-sector growth.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the general features of the model are the following: (i) The aggregate production functions for the goods and service sector are Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) with constant returns to scale in three skill types (white-, pink-, and blue-collar occupations) and capital. Capital and white-collar skill form a nested CES composite input. There are both time-varying neutral and nonneutral technological change, and combined aggregate productivity and relative product price shocks. The relative goods-to-service product price and the price of capital are taken as exogenous to the United States economy. (ii) Individuals age 16-65 choose among eight discrete alternatives at each age, working in any of the six sector-occupations, attending school, or remaining in the home sector. An individual receives a stochastic wage offer from each sector occupation in each period that is the product of a competitively determined sector-occupation-specific skill rental price and the individual's accumulated sector-occupation-specific skill. There is an age-invariant nonpecuniary payoff to each sector-occupation and a stochastic consumption value of attending school and of remaining in the home sector. (iii) The population at any calendar time consists of overlapping generations of individuals of both sexes age 16 to 64 and is time varying. The population consists of four types of individuals, where a type is distinguished by their endowment of each sector-occupation-specific skill and their consumption values of schooling and home.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to solve the model for the six equilibrium skill prices, which are determined by equating skill prices to their respective marginal revenue products evaluated at aggregate skill amounts and capital, researchers adopt a forecasting rule, that is, a joint stochastic process, for skill prices, and develop an iterative algorithm to determine the parameters of the process. The joint skill rental price process is expectations consistent.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…although researchers incorporate all of the features of Lee (2005), there are additional features of the Heckman, Lochner, and Taber formulation that are omitted; the reverse is also true. The most important differences are that Heckman, Lochner, and Taber allow for decisions about svaings and time spent on human capital investment on the job. Researchers model schooling as a sequential decision, allow for idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, for unobserved heterogeneity in skill endowments and in preferences.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…researchers estimate the parameters of the model by matching data moments on employment, wages and school enrollment from the March supplements of the Current Population Surveys from 1968 to 2001 on sectoral output and capital from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and on employment transitions from the NLSY79.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…parameter estimates are used to simulate counterfactual experiments to evaluate the issues presented above. In particular, researchers simulate economies in which mobility costs differ and in which the degree of specificity of work experience in the skill production functions differ.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…factor and product markets are competitive by assumption in the model of interest to this research.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…assuming that labor markets are closed, researchers adopt the approach that all other markets are open because it is more tractable for computational purposes and because it is unclear a priori which assumption is a better approximation. Assuming that markets are closed would add considerable complexity to the individual's optimization problem, for example, by having to solve also for life cycle savings, as well as requiring that researchers solve for additional equilibrium prices.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…given the questions posed by this research, the worker-consumer side is modeled at the microlevel as a dynamic optimization problem. However, for tractability, researchers do not model savings behavior and they assume that labor supply decisions are independent of relative product prices. This latter assumption avoids several complications. Researchers do not have to specify a stochastic process for the evolution of the relative price of goods to services and, more importantly, researchers do not have to estimate the parameters of the consumption branch of the utility function. 
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the basic setup of the model is that thre are six skill types of labor, three within each of the two production sectors. The demand for skill types is determined by their respective marginal revenue products. Factor demand and product supply shift because there is a technological change in each sector.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the model allows for both sector-specific Hicks neutral and skill-biased technological change. Because there seems to have been a structural break in 1980, the model allows for the pace of skill-biased technological change to differ after 1980. In addition, exogenous changes in the relative price of goods to services and in the rental price of capital directly affect product supplies and factor demands.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the model's estimates will determine the extent to which the growth in the service sector resulted from technological change, and factor and product price changes.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…researchers assume that capital can flow between sectors costlessly. Allowing for adjustment costs would greatly complicate the analysis as it would also make the production side of the model, which is now a static problem, dynamic. It is unclear how the demand for labor in general, and specifically by skill type, would be affected in both the short and long term, allowing for adjustment costs to capital.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the solution of the log-log growth rate model serves as input to the estimation procedure. Estimation is by simulated method of moments. Specifically, a weighted average distance between sample moments and simulated moments is minized with respect to the model's parameters. The weights are the inverses of the estimated variances of the moments. The procedure requires a choice of moments.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the simulated moments are generated for any given set of parameters and the derived series of equilibrium rental prices and aggregate shocks by simulating the behavior of samples of 800 individuals per cohort, starting from cohorts that turned age 16 in 1919, and thus will be age 65 in 1968, and ending with cohorts that turned age 16 in 2000. Cross-sectional simulated moments therefore contain 40,000 observations. Simulated moments weight each cohort by their representation in the population of 16-to-65-year-olds.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…in the model, sector-occupation-specific employment and schooling choices are mutually exclusive. In the estimation of the model, the decision period is assumed to be annual.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the normalizations that are adopted in the model are that the constant term in each sector-occupation skill production function for type one males is set to zero. Thus, the levels of skill rental prices across occupation sectors cannot be compared, although their changes over time are identified. For the same reason, aggregate levels of sector-occupation-specific skill are not comparable, which implies that the factor share parameters in the aggregate sector production functions are relative to these normalizations. The nonpecuniary benefit associated with white-collar employment in the goods sector is also normalized to zero (for both males and females). Thus, the nonpecuniary benefits of working in all other sector-occupations, as well as the consumption values of schooling and home, are relative to this normalization.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimates is dependent on the matrix of eerivatives of the moments with respect to the parameters and the variance-covariance matrix of the moments. Off-diagonal elements are ignored. Identification of the model's parameters is implied by invertibility. Heuristically, identification is achieved by a combination of functional form and distributional assumptions, along with exclusion restrictions. In terms of the latter, production function paramters are identified because current and past cohort sizes and rental prices of capital, assumed exogenous, are valid instruments for input levels. Identification of the wage offer parameters follows from standard selection correction arguments, namely from distributional assumptions and from the existence of variables that affect choices (variables in the utility function such as numbers of children) that are not in the wage offer function. Identification of utility function parameters follows from the existence of variables in the wage function that do not enter the utility function, for example, sector-specific work experience.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…researchers estimate the model with four types of individuals, having found substantial improvements in fit over three or fewer types.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the model treats all sector-occupation-specific skills as distinct. An alternative would be that occupation-specific skill is the identical skill in the two sectors. In that case, in a frictionless economy, occupation-specific skill rental prices would differ only because of differing nonpecuniary values attached to sector and, given their assumed constancy over time, the ratio of goods to service occupation-speicifc skill rental prices would not vary over time.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…a test of whether occupation-specific skills are distinct between sectors is whether the parameters of the occupation-specific skill production functions differ between sectors. The restrictions that would apply in that case are equality of schooling coefficients for the same occupation in the two sectors, and equality of the weights in composite experience for the same occupation in each sector.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…it would be possible to improve on the approximations by adding additional state variables to the forecasting equation, for example, the capital rental price. The cost is that one would have to include those state variables in the state space of the individual's optimization problem and specify their equations of motion. the former increases computational time and the latter increases the number of parameters to be estimated.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the figures based on the model are obtained from simulating the behavior of 800 persons per birth cohort. There are 50 birth cohorts in each cross section and thus each simulated cross section has 40,000 observations. The simulation start with the cohort that would be age 65 in 1968 (age 16 in 1918) and continues through the cohort that would be age 16 in 2000 (age 65 in 2050).
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…counterfactual experiments of mobility include 1.) no mobility between sectors; 2.) no mobility between sectors except after intervening period of nonemployment; and 3.) zero cost of changing sectors. All of the exogenous variables and exogenous stochastic processes are unchanged in all of the experiments. These experiments all involve large changes in mobility costs and the effect of these cahnges on sectoral output and inputs are also large.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the first couterfactual (counterfactual experiment 1) raises intersectoral mobility costs to a level at which it is essentially never optimal to switch from the sector of the first employment spell. That is, in each period after the first working period, an individual's choice set is restricted to working in the sector first chosen or to the home sector.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the second counterfactual (counterfactual experiment 2) imposes a severe mobility restriction, namely that an individual may change sectors after first returning to the home sector for at least one period, but otherwise cannot move between sectors.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the third counterfactual (counterfactual experiment 3) assumes that cross-sector mobility costs are zero.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…researchers perform two counterfactual experiments on work experience.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the first work experience counterfactual (counterfactual experiment 4) is implemented as follows: for each sector-occupation skill production function, researchers average the coefficients on white-collar goods-sector-specific work experience and white-collar service-sector-specific work experience, and similarly for pink- and blue-collar goods- and service-sector-specific work experience. In this way, it is irrelevant in which sector work experience was accumulated in terms of skill production.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the second work experience counterfactual (counterfactual experiement 5) is implemented by setting all cross-sector work experience coefficients to zero in each sector-occupation-specific skill production function.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…the baseline case (counterfactual experiment 6) is implemented in which all of the four factors - cohort size, the fertility transition process, technological change, and prices - are set to their 1960 levels, that is a no-growth economy in the long run.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…counterfactual experiment 7 allows for changing cohort size.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…counterfactual experiment 8 allows both for changing cohort size as in the previous experiment and for the fertility transition process with respect to the number of children under the age of 6 to change as it did after 1960.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…counterfactual experiment 9 allows for Hicks-neutral and skill-biased technological change as it is estimated to have occurred.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…counterfactual experiment 10 allows for changes in relative product prices and the price of capital as they actually occurred.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…counterfactual experiment 11 simultaneously implements both experiment 9 and experiment 10.

The missing transitions are between 1971 and 1972, 1972 and 1973, 1976 and 1977, 1985 and 1986, and 1995 and 1996.

160~D1, D2~DV57~Derived Variable~One-Period Joint Sectoral, School, and Home Transitions, Age, Sex~…a number of years are missing because identifiers that match households between 2 years are not available. The missing transitions are between 1971 and 1972, 1972 and 1973, 1976 and 1977, 1985 and 1986, and 1995 and 1996.

160~D2~DV58~Derived Variable~Proportion of Choice Alternatives, Year, Sex, Child Presence~…the proportion of individuals choosing each of the eight alternatives by year (1968-2000), sex, and by whether a preschool child is present.
160~D2~DV58~Derived Variable~Proportion of Choice Alternatives, Year, Sex, Education~…the proportion of individuals choosing each of the eight alternatives by year (1968-2000), sex, and schooling level.
160~D1, D2~DV59~Derived Variable~One-Period Joint Transitions, Year, Sex~…the one-period joint transitions between the eight alternatives by year (1968-2000) and sex.
160~D1, D2~DV59~Derived Variable~One-Period Joint Transitions, Year, Sex~…a number of years are missing because identifiers that match households between 2 years are not available. The missing transitions are between 1971 and 1972, 1972 and 1973, 1976 and 1977, 1985 and 1986, and 1995 and 1996.
160~D1, D3~F8~Findings~Proportion of Sector-Specific New Entrants by Cohort~…in terms of changes within cohorts, those who entered the market in the period 1968 to 1974 increased their service-sector employment from 0.63 (at ages 18 to 24) to 0.75 (at ages 46 to 52). This life cycle pattern appears to hold through the 1975 to 1981 entrant cohort. For the 1982 to 1988 entrant cohort, however, the proportion of workers employed in the service sector rose more slowly across the first three age categories and for the 1989 to 1995 cohort actually declined over the first two age categories, an indication that relative service-sector employment growth may be waning.
160~D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Capital Used~…the amount of capital used in each sector at time t is determined by equating the marginal revenue product of capital in each sector at time t to the exogenous rental price of capital.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~…individuals face budget constraints contingent on their real wage (earnings) received from working a sector-occupation at a specific time, the cost of college attendance, and the additional cost of graduate school attendance.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~…to flexibly fit the one-period transition patterns into sector-occupation-specific employment, researchers include parameters into this question that reflect a direct cost of switching from any of the eight alternatives to any of the six employment alternatives.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~…the budget constraint does not allow for savings. To close the equilibrium model, payments from the return on capital in any year are assumed to be independent of all choices.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Choice-Specific Utility~…for tractibility, researchers assume that the discrete time allocation decision is independent of the relative price of goods to services, that is, researchers assume a utility specification that enables them to ignore the conumption allocation decision.
160~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Choice-Specific Utility~…the flow utility at each age for individual of a certain type.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Choice-Specific Utility~…the utility specification allows for differential nonpecuniary benefits associated with working in each sector-occupation because wage differentials alone do not provide a good fit to the choice distribution.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Choice-Specific Utility~…to capture the strong degree of persistence in the choice of the schooling and home alternatives, those choice-specific utilities are assumed to vary by an individual's time-invariant type, in addition to being subject to age-varying independent and identically distributed stochastic shocks.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Choice-Specific Utility~…alternative formulations of utility with the property that the labor allocation decision is independent of the relative price of goods to services are that utility is linear or quasilinear, and additively separable in goods and services consumption, or that utility is Cobb-Douglas. A simpler alternative is to invoke the Hicks composite commodity theorem together with additive linearity of the utility function in the composite conumption good.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Choice-Specific Utility~…to fit the fact that returning to school after a period of nonattendance is rare, the utility specification also includes a psychic cost of reentering high school (the compled years of schooling up to a certain age) less than 12, and a separate cost for reentering college, (the completed years of schooling up to a certain age) more than 12.

Of those males (females) for whom year t-1 was their first year working in the service sector, 76% (89%) of workers in year t reamined in the service sector, while for those who had 10 to 15 years of service-sector work experience, 97% (98%) of workers remained in the service sector.
160~V25~L20~Variable Value~White-Collar~…white-collar occupations include professional, technical, and managerial categories.
160~V25~L20~Variable Value~White-Collar~…capital and white-collar skill form a nested CES composite input.
160~D2, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Current and Past Productivity Shocks~…a vector of current and past productivity shocks as included in determining the six excess demand functions.
160~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Simulated Method of Moments~…to estimate the model, researchers need to simulate the joint distribution of work experience and schooling as of 1968. To obtain a close fit to the distribution of schooling observed in 1968, the utility associated with attending school was, therefore, allowed to differ by cohort in a piecewise linear manner.

161~D1, D2, D3~F10~Findings~Interaction Parameter Result for High- Versus Mid-Wage~…the insignficant coefficient on the interaction term between FDI activity and race suggests that FDI activity is not associated with an erosion of the black white probability differential for employment in high-wage jobs versus mid-level-wage employment, and that instead blacks share with whites the same signficant probability increase in high-wage employment.

162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…most Current Population Survey-based work finds no overall trend through the late 1980s.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…most Panel Study of Income Dynamics-based work finds an increase in job mobility since the 1970s.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…because panel data such as this data source are often necessary to answer questions relating to the consequences of job instability, it is important to know whether the Panel Study of Income Dynamics can produce results consistent with the Current Population Survey when changes to the survey are handled appropriately.
162~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Share of Newly Employed Over the Relevant Period~…throughout this research, little evidence is found, in either data set, of a reduction in the share of workers with employer tenure of 1 year or less between 1983 and 1996.
162~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Share of Middle-Length Employed Over the Relative Period~…throughout this research, an increase in the share of workers with tenure of less than 10 years between 1983 and 1996 is discovered, concentrated among older male workers toward the end of the period.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~"…changes in the questionnaire skip pattern and question wording in the 1984 to 1987 surveys make the responses to the ""reason for job change"" question inconsistent over time. From 1984 through 1987, the ""reason for job change"" question was asked of all respondents who reported that their current job started after January of the previous year, rather than within the past 12 months as in prior years. This artificially inflates the job-changing rates based on this question for these 4 years."
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~"...those who have changed positions within the past 12 months, or since the beginning of the previous calendar year, are asked, ""what happened to the job you had before - did the company go out of business, were you laid off, promoted, were you not working, or what?"" "
162~D2~T1~Time Period~1984-1987~"…survey period through which the ""reason for job change"" question in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics is altered, making the responses to this question inconsistent over time."
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample for this data set is restricted to include heads of household and their spouses, between the ages of 20 and 59, who are employed but not self-employed at the time of the survey. Also, because samples are extremely small for those reporting their race as neither black nor white, researchers also restrict the male sample to blacks and whites only. The restriction to household heads and spouses is driven by data limitations in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics; researchers attempt to generate a comparable Current Population Survey sample by including reference persons and their spouses.

The restriction to household heads and spouses is driven by data limitations in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…information on job tenure for persons other than household heads and wives is not available in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and for wives it is available only for 1981 and after.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the male in a two-adult household is automatically considered the head of household.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…data used primarily as a series of repeated cross sections, and workers are included in any year in which they meet the other sample requirements.
162~D2~T2~Time Period~1976-1996~…survey period from which Panel Study of Income Dynamics data is drawn for the primary analysis in this research.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the primary analysis in this research uses Panel Study of Income Dynamics data from the 1976 through 1996 surveys. Researchers use the entire Panel Study of Income Dynamics sample, including the low-income sample, and use Panel Study of Income Dynamics sample weights throughout. Researchers obtain similar results using only the random sample without weights.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the variable of primary interest in this data source reports the time that a worker has been with his or her current employer.
162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…the variable of primary interest from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics reporting the time that a worker has been with his or her current employer.
162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…this question is used to construct the fraction of individuals who have employer tenure below some level.
162~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Stability~…the researchers choice of a measure of job stability is dictated largely by the desire to have as close a counterpart as possible in the Current Population Survey tenure supplement data. This means relying on a cross-sectional measure and ignoring the panel dimension of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, although researchers do consider whether measures that use the longitduinal nature of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics show different trends.
162~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Stability~"…the initial measure of job stability of is the share of workers in ""new"" jobs (i.e. with employer tenure of less than 18 months). Researchers also present results on the fraction of workers with tenure less than 10 years to capture potential changes at a higher point in the tenure distribution."
162~V1, V2, V3~L1~Variable Value~Less than 18 Months~…the choice of a time frame of less than 18 months for determining job stability is dictated by the researchers' desire to have a comparable measure of low tenure in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey.
162~D1~V2~Variable~CPS Tenure~…in the Current Population Survey, employer tenure is generally reported in years.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the Current Population Survey, employer tenure is generally reported in years.
162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, employer tenure is generally reported in months.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, employer tenure is generally reported in months.
162~V1, V2, V3~L1~Variable Value~Less than 18 Months~…because researchers use a threshold for employer tenure in the Current Population Survey of less than or equal to 1 year and assume that respondents follow a simple rounding rule, it is believed the less-than-18-month definition in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics is the most comparable.
162~V1, V2, V3~L2~Variable Value~Less than 10 Years~…in the results for tenure less than 10 years, researchers use a cutoff of 9.5 years in the panel Study of Income Dynamics, or 114 months. 
162~D2~T3~Time Period~1993-1996~…survey period from which Panel Study of Income Dynamics data is early release, and so results may be subject to revision on final release of the data.

162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…for the survey years 1976 to 1977 and 1981 to 1992, this information is taken directly from questions about how long the worker has been with his or her current employer. An important disadvantage of using the employer tenure question is that it was not asked in the 1979 and 1980 surveys and was asked only of those under the age of 45 in 1978. While some previous work has used alternative measures to get around this gap in coverage of the employer tenure questions, researchers prefer to use this, the most straightfoward measure of employer tenure, in those years for which it is available.

While some previous work has used alternative measures to get around this gap in coverage of the employer tenure questions, researchers prefer to use this, the most straightfoward measure of employer tenure, in those years for which it is available.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…prior to 1984, the survey asked respondents how long they had worked for their present employer, without distinguishing between total time with the employer and a worker's most recent spell of employement. Beginning in 1984, respondents were explicity asked to provide the total time they had been with their employer. For workers who have multiple spells with a given employer, separated either tby nonemployment or employment with other firms, this change in question wording will prompt different answers.
162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…prior to 1984, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics asked respondents how long they had worked for their present employer, without distinguishing between total time with the employer and a worker's most recent spell of employement. Beginning in 1984, respondents were explicity asked to provide the total time they had been with their employer. 
162~D2~T4~Time Period~Pre-1984~…survey period of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics when respondents were asked about how long they had worked for their present employer, without distinguishing between total time with the employer and a worker's most recent spell of employment.
162~D2~T5~Time Period~1984-Present~…survey period of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics when respondents were asked explicity asked to provide the total time they had been with their employer.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…starting in 1988, this data source collected information on both length of total employment and time in the most recent spell with the current employer.
162~D2~DV2~Derived Variable~PSID Median Tenure~…using data from 1988, researchers have calculated median tenure rates based on total time with employer and time in the most recent spell.
162~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~PSID Low Tenure~…using data from 1988, researchers have calculated median tenure rates based on total time with employer and time in the most recent spell.
162~D2~F3~Findings~Median Total Tenure~…median total tenure is approximately 2 months higher than median tenure in the most recent spell.
162~D2~F4~Findings~Probability of Low Tenure~…the probability of having tenure less than 18 months is approximately 2 percentage points lower when using the total time with employer measure. This comparison, however, is very sensitive to the tenure cutoff used because the total measures are far more concentrated at 6 to 12 month increments because the total time measure is from a question asking for a response in months, while the time in most recent spell measure comes from a question eliciting the month and year that spell started.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~"…in 1983 and prior, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics question was ""How long have you worked for your present employer?"" From 1984 to 1987, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics employer tenure question was, ""How many years altogether hav eyou worked for your present employer?"" After 1987, it was ""How many years experience do you have altogether with your present employer?"""
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1996, this data source collected information on total tenure and tenure in the most recent spell with an employer.
162~D1~T6~Time Period~1996.0~…survey year of the Current Population Survey when information was collected on total tneure and tenure in the most recent spell with an employer.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…there exists substantial difficulties in identifying employer changes in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
162~V3~L3~Variable Value~Promotion~"…this reported ""reason for job change"" distinquishing promotions from other types of job changes is the primary source in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for identifying promotions. "
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~"...the primary source for identifying promotions is the ""reason for job change"" question that distinguishes promotions from other types of job changes. This is likely to leave some within-employer moves identified as job changes since some of the other possible responses could also reflect within-employer movements and because of missing values in this variable."
162~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Reason for Job Change~"...the primary source for identifying promotions is the ""reason for job change"" question that distinguishes promotions from other types of job changes. This is likely to leave some within-employer moves identified as job changes since some of the other possible responses could also reflect within-employer movements and because of missing values in this variable."
162~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Reason for Job change~"…possible responses to the ""reason for job change"" question that might be applicable to within-employer changes include ""promotion"", ""wanted a change in jobs"", ""other or transfer"", and ""job completed""."
162~D2~V3~Variable~PSID Position Tenure~…one advantage of drawing information on the length of position-specific tenure is that this question was asked in every year from 1976 through 1996; the problem, of course, is that low-position tenure may reflect a recent position change or promotion but no change in the employer.
162~D2~V3~Variable~PSID Position Tenure~"…one concern with the position tenure variable for the current researchers' purposes is that between 1983 and 1984, the question wording was changed from asking about how long a worker has been in his or her present position to asking  when the current position started (calendar month and year); the result of this change from a response in terms of a number of months to a response of a starting calendar month is that heaping of responses around multiples of 6 months is much more common prior to 1984. The exact question changed from ""How long have you been in your present position?"" to ""When did you start working in your present position?"""
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the position-specific tenure variable is asked in all relevant survey years of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics; one issue with this variable, however, is that, between 1983 and 1984, the question wording was changed from asking about how long a worker has been in his or her present position to asking when the current position started (calendar month and year); the result of this change from a response in terms of a number of months to a response of a starting calendar month is that heaping of responses around multiples of 6 months is much more common prior to 1984. In contrast, the employer tenure question has always been asked in terms of the length of employment rather than the calendar month when the employment began.
162~D1~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…the employer tenure question has always been asked in terms of length of employment, rather than the calendar month when the employment began.
162~D2~V3~Variable~PSID Position Tenure~…using the position tenure variable, a series of dummy variables were constructed to specify for varying lengths of position tenure and reasons for job changes.
162~V3~L4~Variable Value~Less Than or Equal to 1 Year~…a binary variable constructed from the position tenure variable equal to one if position tenure is less than or equal to 1 year.
162~D1, D2~V5~Variable ~Not Promoted~"…a binary variable constructed from the position tenure variable equal to one if an individual's reason for changing jobs was not ""promotion""."
162~V3~L4~Variable Value~Less Than or Equal to 1 Year~…this series shows a downward trend over time.
162~D2~T7~Time Period~1972-1975~"…for the years 1972 to 1975, researchers estimate the probability of having job tenure of less than 12 months measured with Panel Study of Income Dynamics data; this is relevant to the current analysis because the early years of Current Population Survey data refer to job rather than employer. Researchers use less than 12 months as the cutoff for this ""job""-based series because job tenure is reported only in bracketed quantities during these years."
162~D2~F5~Findings~Job Tenure vs. Employer Tenure~"…in 1975, the fraction of men with ""job"" tenure less than 12 months was 0.18; in the following year, the fraction of men with ""employer"" tenure of less than 12 months was only 0.13. If the job versus employer tenure distinction is not important, this would imply an implausible reduction in the fraction of workers with low tenure of more than 25% in one year. This result is interpreted as a caution against combining series on job and employer tenure."
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data employed from this data set comes from the tenure supplements included in the Current Population Survey in January of 1973, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1987, and 1991. Subsequent data is drawn from the employee benefits supplements from May 1979 and April 1993 and the displaced workers supplement from February 1996, which asked about employer tenure. Information on tenure is also available in the 1983 and 1988 employee benefits supplements.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all data are weighted by the supplement weights, when available, or by the basic Current Population Survey weight when supplement weights are not available. In practice, however, weighting makes very little difference to the results in this research.
162~D1~T8~Time Period~1973, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1987, 1991~…relevant survey years from which January Current Population Survey data from the tenure supplements is drawn. 
162~D1~T9~Time Period~1979, 1993~…relevant survey years also use the survey employee benefits supplements from May 1979 and April 1993 and the displaced workers supplement from Februrary 1996, which asked about employer tenure.
162~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~CPS Low Tenure~…the measure of low tenure in the Current Population Survey is based on the tenure question asked in the various supplements. In 1973, 1978, and 1981, this question asks what years individuals started working in their current job; because the question was asked in January, it measures the incidence of low tenure within a 13-month window.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the measure of low tenure in the Current Population Survey is based on the tenure question asked in the various supplements. In 1973, 1978, and 1981, this question asks what years individuals started working in their current job; because the question was asked in January, it measures the incidence of low tenure within a 13-month window.
162~D1~T10~Time Period~1973, 1978, 1981~…survey period of the Current Population Survey from which the tenure question asks what year individuals started working in their current job.
162~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~CPS Low Tenure~…in 1973, 1978, and 1981, researchers record Current Population Survey respondents as having tenure of 1 year or less if they started working in their current job in the survey year or in the year prior.
162~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~CPS Low Tenure~…for this measure, note the emphasis on job rather than employer tenure. As suggested by comparison of alternative Panel Study of Income Dynamics series, measured tenure could be less than actual employer tenure if individuals give their tenure in a particular position rather than their tenure with a particular employer.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1979 and from 1983 forward, the Current Population Survey question on tenure asks about the length of time individuals worked for their current employer. The shift from calendar to elapsed time may cause the share of workers with low tenure to increases, however. For tenure longer than 1 year, the Current Population Survey measures tenure in integer year. If individuals follow a simple rounding rule, the 1 year or less tenure variable in the Current Population Survey will include all individuals who started working for their current employer in an 18-month window.
162~D1~T11~Time Period~1979, 1983-Present~…in 1979 and from 1983 forward, the Current Population Survey question on tenure asks about the length of time individuals worked for their current employer.
162~D1~V2~Variable~CPS Tenure~…in 1979 and from 1983 forward, the Current Population Survey question on tenure asks about the length of time individuals worked for their current employer. The shift from calendar to elapsed time may cause the share of workers with low tenure to increases, however. For tenure longer than 1 year, the Current Population Survey measures tenure in integer years. If individuals follow a simple rounding rule, the 1 year or less tenure variable in the Current Population Survey will include all individuals who started working for their current employer in an 18-month window.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…supplement weights are not available in 1978 and 1981.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…interviewers were instructed to follow a rounding variable in which the 1 year or less tenure variable in the Current Population Survey will include all individuals who started working for their current employer in an 18-month window.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…given the researchers' interpretation of the questions and responses over time, the series they report based on the new tenure question represents the fraction of individuals with employer tenure less than 18 months; the old series refers to job tenure less than or equal to 13 months.
162~D1~V2~Variable~CPS Tenure~…given the researchers' interpretation of the questions and responses over time, the series they report based on the new tenure question represents the fraction of individuals with employer tenure less than 18 month, while the old series refers to job tenure less than or equal to 13 months.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…because it is thought that the simultaneous shifts from job to employer tenure and from calendar to elapsed time were roughly offsetting in their impact on our measure of low employer tenure. It may, therefore, be difficult to distinguish changes in job stability between the 1970s and 1990s using Current Population Survey data.
162~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Distribution of Employer Tenure and Job Tenure~"…under the assumption that there was no change in the distribution of employer tenure from 1975 to 1976, the switch from ""job tenure less than 12 months"" to ""employer tenure less than 18 months"" produces a spurious reduction in the fraction with low tenure of approximately 2 percentage points. This is roughly the magnitude by which the Current Population Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics results for men differ during the 1970s."
162~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Share of Newly Employed~…when estimating the trends in the share of workers with low tenure, researchers focus first on the share of employed individuals with 1 year or less of tenure.
162~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Share of Newly Employed~…the fraction of men and women with low tenure for the period 1973 to 1996.
162~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~CPS Standard Errors~…for the Current Population Survey, standard errors are estimated as the share of the sample with 1 year or less of tenure multiplied by one minus the share of the sample with 1 year or less of tenure, all divided by the number of unweighted observations in the cell, and finally, all square rooted.
162~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~PSID Standard Errors~…to address the sample design issues in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, standard errors are estimated using balanced half-sample replication (SEE Wolter 1985).
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the male sample includes blacks and whites only, the female sample includes all race/ethnicity groups, and the male and female samples include employed individuals aged 20 to 59.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the male sample includes blacks and whites only, the female sample includes all race/ethnicity groups, and the male and female samples include employed individuals aged 20 to 59.
162~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Probability of Low Tenure Over the Relevant Period~…from 1983 through 1996, researchers find a slight increase in the probability of tenure less than or equal to 1 year in both data sets in the early 1980s, a decline during the early 1990s, and an increase in the middle 1990s. The peaks and valleys are somewhat more pronounced in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (particularly the decline between 1988 and 1992), but the overall pattern of the incidence of low tenure is quite consistent between the two data sets.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the break in the Current Population Survey series between the ""old"" and ""new"" questions coincides with a change in the relevant question reference from job to employer. Thus, the expectation is that the Current Population Survey observations using the old question may be elevated as individuals reported changes in jobs that could have occured without a change in employer. Of course, the change in the time period over which tenure is reported (from 13 to 18 months) would counter this tendency. "
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…Current Population Survey and Panel Study of Income Dynamics are very consistent for males from 1983 forward but somewhat less consistent when the 1970s are considered.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…Current Population Survey and Panel Study of Income Dynamics are very consistent for males from 1983 forward but somewhat less consistent when the 1970s are considered.
162~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Female Tenure Differences Across Datasets~…when comparing the fraction of women with tenure less than 18 months across datasets, the fraction of women with low tenure is generally 3 to 6 percentage points lower in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, but the trends are comparable. Neither data set shows strong evidence of an increase in the fraction of women with low tenure during the 1980s and 1990s. The Current Population Survey shows a slight increases in this fraction in 1996, while the Panel Study of Income Dynamics shows a slight decline if the entire period from 1981 through 1996 is considered.
162~D2~F9~Findings~PSID Young Males Low Tenure Rate Differences~…for males 20- to 29-years-old in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, low tenure rates increase from an average of .32 between and 1982 to an average of .37 between 1986 and 1996.
162~D1~F10~Findings~CPS Young Males Low Tenure Rate Differences~…for males 20- to 29-years-old in the Current Population Survey, the low-tenure share is quite stable near .36, with the exception of 1979 and 1996, where it was closer to .41.
162~D2~F11~Findings~PSID Middle-Young Males Low Tenure Rate Differences~…for males 30- to 39-years-old in the Panel Study of income Dynamics, the low-tenure share remains roughly constant near .20 for the whole sample period, with perhaps a slight movement upward in 1996.
162~D1~F12~Findings~CPS Middle-Young Males Low Tenure Rate Differences~…for males 30- to 39-years-old in the Current Population Survey, the low-tenure share remains roughly constant near .20 for the whole sample period, with perhaps a slight movement upward in 1996.
162~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Middle-Aged Males Low Tenure Rate Differences Across Datasets~…for males 40- to 49-years old, the incidence of low tenure in the Current Population Survey is consistently higher than in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, although the series are quite close in 1993 and 1996 and the trends are similar to those of the younger age groups.
162~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Oldest-Aged Males Low Tenure Rate Differences Across Datasets~…for the oldest age group of men aged 50 to 59, both the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and Current Population Survey show a very slight increase in the incidence of low tenure through the early 1990s, with a subsequent decline (more pronounced in the PSID) in the mid-1990s.

162~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Female Low Tenure Rate Differences~…for women, there is little evidence of any significant changes in the fraction of different age groups with low tenure between 1981 and 1996. Among the youngest women there is a declin in the fraction in new jobs from 1981 through the early 1990s and then an increase in the last few years of our sample. For the older age groups the fractions with low tenure are relatively flat over time.
162~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Share of Middle-Length Employed~…an alternative measure of the share of low tenure that captures wider range changes in each year with tenure less than 10 years for different age groups.
162~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Share of Middle-Length Employed~…shows the fraction of workers in each year with tenure less than 10 years for different age groups; this focuses attention on higher points in the tenure distribution and, particularly for older workers, may capture more of the potential changes in the overall distribution.
162~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Share of Newly Employed Across Datasets~…the Current Population Survey gives consistently higher estimates than the Panel Study of Income Dynamics of the share of male workers with employer tenure less than 10 years, particularly for men 30 to 39 years old. Different sample coverage may partially explain these discrepancies.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…because of the nature of its sample, this data source does not include immigrants who entered the United States after the first wave of interviews.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey is a representative sample of the population in each year of the survey. Unfortunately, immigrants are not separately identified in the Current Population Survey prior to 1994 making it difficult to extract them from the survey for additional comparability between the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and this data source.
162~D1~F17~Findings~Share of Middle-Length Employed for Natives vs. Immigrants by Gender~…using the 1996 sample of the Current Population Survey, researchers found that the share of native men having less than 10 years of employer tenure was .58, while for immigrants it was .75; for women, the shares were .68 and .79 for natives and immigrants, respectively.
162~D1~F18~Findings~Differences in the Share of Newly Employed for Natives vs. Immigrants by Gender~…using the 1996 sample of the Current Population Survey, the difference in share between natives and immigrants was .04 and .01 for men and women, respectively, for the 1 year or less of tenure measure.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the characteristics of both samples change somewhat between the 1970s and 1990s; in particular, both samples are more eeducated and slightly older by 1996 than in the 1980s or 1970s. These changes in the sample composition over time could mask changes in the underlying incidence of low tenure for workers with a fixed set of characteristics.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the characteristics of both samples change somewhat between the 1970s and 1990s; in particular, both samples are more eeducated and slightly older by 1996 than in the 1980s or 1970s. These changes in the sample composition over time could mask changes in the underlying incidence of low tenure for workers with a fixed set of characteristics.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…to examine changes in the adjusted incidence of low tenure holding individual characteristics (age, education, and race) constant, researchers perform regression analysis of the incidence of low tenure.
162~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to examine changes in the adjusted incidence of low tenure holding individual characteristics (age, education, and race) constant, researchers perform regression analysis of the incidence of low tenure.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…regression results are presented for men only since researchers have the necessary education and race information in all years.
162~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…regression results are presented for men only since researchers have the necessary education and race information in all years.
162~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Age Group~…an individual characteristic variable included in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure. 
162~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Education~…an individual characteristic variable included in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure. 
162~V7~L9~Variable Value~Less than 12 Years~…one of four education level groups specified for in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~V7~L10~Variable Value~12 Years~…one of four education level groups specified for in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~V7~L11~Variable Value~13 to 15 Years~…one of four education level groups specified for in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~V7~L12~Variable Value~16 or more Years~…one of four education level groups specified for in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~D1, D2~V8~Variable~Race~…an individual characteristic variable included in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure. 
162~V8~L13~Variable Value~White~…one of two race indicators specified in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~V8~L14~Variable Value~Black~…one of two race indicators specified in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~V8~~Methodology~Logit~…in the first step of the estimation process, researchers estimated a logit model on the probability of having employer tenure of less than 1 year or less than 10 years of tenure and controlled for age, age squared, race, education, and calendar year.
162~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Age Squared~…the age category squared as included in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~D1, D2~V0~Variable~Calendar Year~…an indicator variable for calendar year as included in logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure.
162~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Year-Specific Probabilities~…using the calendar year coefficients from logit regressions on the incidence of low tenure, researchers then calculated year-specific probabilities.
162~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Year-Specific Probabilities~…in creating these probabilities, the logit function is evaluated at the observed mean of the other covariates.
162~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in the second setp of the estimation process, year-specifc probabilities were regressed on a time trend using ordinary least squares.
162~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…because the error term in this second-stage regression is heteroskedastic, researchers present heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors estimated using the jackknife.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…first-stage logit regressions include control variables for age, age squared, education group,  and race group (where appropriate).
162~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…second-stage linear regressions are ran on the adjusted year-specific predicted probabilities on time trend
162~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Year-Specific Probabilities~…predicted probabilities are calculated at the mean value of the control variables.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…estimates the trends in regression-adjusted probabilities of tenure of 1 year or less for the two data sets. Researchers show results for both the full periods and for 1983 to 1996 only but focus attention on the latter period, in which the measures are viewed to more comparable with one another.
162~D1, D2~F19~Findings~Estimated Low Tenure Trends Across Datasets for the Later Period~…when estimating the trends in regression-adjusted probabilities of tenure of 1 year or less for the two data sets starting in the later period, within certain subgroups, the estimated trend in the Current Population Survey is larger, although often not statistically significant, while in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, there are statistically significant trends only for 40- to 49-year-olds, high school graduates, and blacks. The trends for 40- to 49-year-olds (as well as 50- to 59-year-olds) and high school graduates are also statistically significant in the Current Population Survey. This analysis largely confirms the visual evidence in previous sections of little movement in the probability of having tenure less than 1 year over the relevant sample period.
162~D1, D2~F20~Findings~Estimated Low Tenure Trends Across Datasets for the Full Period~…when estimating the trends in regression-adjusted probabilities of tenure of 1 year or less for the two data sets starting in the 1970s, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, including the years 1976, 1977, 1981, and 1982 produces a statistically signfiicant and upward trend for almost every subgroup. The pattern of a smaller increase in the Current Population Survey from the 1970s to the 1980s is consistent with the hypothesis that the question changes lead to an overstatement of low tenure probabilities prior to 1983. This evidence suggests that measured trend in job tenure are sensitive to the exact time period under consideration.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…this data is more consistent over the entire period 1976 to 1996 and provides evidence of a small increase in the fraction of male workers in new jobs from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…results are presented for the probability of tenure of 1 year or less or the probability of 10 years or less.
162~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Stability~…as noted throughout this research, fractions of employed invididuals with tenure below 1 or 10 years is not an ideal measure of job stability.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…including of only employed individuals may mask business cycle effects on the tenure distribution; for example, if equal shares of individuals with low tenure and with high tenure become unemployed because of a cyclical downtown, the measure of tenure distribution would not capture this decline  job stability.
162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…when nonemployed individuals are included in the analysis, they are counted as having 0 months of employer tenure.
162~D1~V2~Variable~CPS Tenure~…when nonemployed individuals are included in the analysis, they are counted as having 0 months of employer tenure.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the population- and employment-based fractions with tenure less than 1 and less than 10 years show extremely similar trends from 1981 through 1996 suggesting that the distinction between population- and employment-based fractions of workers with low tenure is unlikely to alter the estimated conclusions.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey population-based series shows a slight increase in the fraction of men with low tenure. This population-based trend is mainly driven by the estimated probabilities for 1979 and 1983, which are lower than in other years (and closer to the employment-based probabilities).
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1979, the Current Population Survey asked the new (employer-based) question, which researchers would have expected to give somewhat smaller estimates of low tenure than in 1978 and 1981, when the old (job-based) question was asked.
162~D1~F21~Findings~Population-Based Series and Upward Trend in Low Tenure Shares~…evidence from the population-based Current Population Survey series from 1979 to 1996 is consistent with the finding of an upward trend in the share of men with low tenure in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1976 through 1996.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…in certain specifications of this model, researchers directly controlled for the effects of the business cycle.
162~D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Retention Rate~…using the longitudinal aspect of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, researchers estimate the fraction of employed individuals in the survey year who had tenure of less than 12 months one year later.
162~D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Retention Rate~…this measure is not sensitive to changes in the flow of workers into employment.
162~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Employment and Low Tenure Probability~…conditioning on employment in the previous year lowers the probability of having tenure of less than 1 year by 5.5 to 6.6 percentage points but has no discernible effects on the trends.
162~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Share of Newly Employed~…because the pool of workers with less than 1 year of tenure is quite small, it is difficult to precisely estimate small changes in this fraction over time, particularly with the sample sizes available in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
162~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…because the pool of workers with less than 1 year of tenure is quite small, it is difficult to precisely estimate small changes in this fraction over time, particularly with the sample sizes available in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the general tendency for Panel Study of Income Dynamics studies to find an upward trend in employment instability where none is found using Current Population Survey data may be explained by three factors: Tenure estimates or job-changing rates based on PAnel Study data may be very sensitive to the particular variables used, the comparison of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey shows some sensitivity of results to the exact time period studied, and question changes in the Current Population Survey prior to 1983 may have had an important effect on comparisons across data sets.
162~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the general tendency for Panel Study of Income Dynamics studies to find an upward trend in employment instability where none is found using Current Population Survey data may be explained by three factors: Tenure estimates or job-changing rates based on PAnel Study data may be very sensitive to the particular variables used, the comparison of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey shows some sensitivity of results to the exact time period studied, and question changes in the Current Population Survey prior to 1983 may have had an important effect on comparisons across data sets.
162~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…results from this data source used as the basis for comparison in the 1970s involve only 2 years in the late 1970s.
162~D2~V1~Variable~PSID Employer Tenure~…researchers view this variables as the cleanest and most consistent variable to measure tenure in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
162~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Overall Finding~…researchers are able to produce consistent results across the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey data sets once comparable time frames, variable definitions, and samples are used.

163~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Relative Sector Wage~…the supply of workers across sectors depends on their relative wages across the two secotrs.
163~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Relative Sector Wage~…some college graduates with a relative preference for the noncollege sector are willing to be in that sector, given the relative wages across sectors.
163~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Relative Sector Wage~…wages adjust to induce college workers to reallocate across sectors.
163~V5~L5~Variable Value~Noncollege Jobs~…the fact that some college workers are in noncollege jobs does not signal a misallocation of resources or an involuntary assignment across sectors.

163~DV1~L3~Variabe Value~Graduate Efficiency~…as the productivity of college graduates in sector 1 rises, the proportion of college graduates employed in sector 2 falls.
163~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Sector~…if sectors are defined as sectors with a college premium below a fixed threshold, then some non colelge sectors will become college sectors as a result of a rising premium in those sectors.

163~V5~L12~Variable Value~Public Administration~…pools together legislators, chief executives and general administrators in public administrations, and administrators and officials in public administrations.
163~V5~L6~Variable Value~College Jobs~…in order to avoid combining occupations that rqurire a college degrees with other occupations that include a mixture college and noncollege graduates, occupations with more than 90% college graduates are classified as college jobs.
163~D1, D3~V5~Variable~Occupation~…the approach of classifying an occupation as a college job if 90% of individuals that hold the occupation are college graduates leaves researchers with 82 occupational categories for which a college premium can be estimated in at least 1 year, including 29 occupations at the three-digit level, which include 34% of college graduates, and 53 aggregated categories that include the remaining 53.5% of college graduates.
163~V5~L5~Variable~Noncollege Jobs~…defined as those occupations with a college premium below a fixed threshold, initially set at 0.10.
163~D1, D2, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Occupation Specific College Premiums~…if in subsequent years an occupation does not have at least 50 college and 50 noncollege workers, a premium is not estimated for that occupation in that year.
163~D1, D2, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Occupation Specific College Premiums~…researchers calculate the probability that each occupation-specific college premium is less than 10%, with which college grades are then assigned the probability that the occupation in which they are employed offers a premium less than 10%, and the aggregate probability is given by the average of these probabilities, an approach that has an advantage of incorporating information on both the point estimate and the precision of the estimate of the college premium.
163~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Proportion of College Graduates in Noncollege Jobs~…in 1983, 10.7% of all college graduates worked in occupations with a college premium less than 0.10.
163~D1, D2, D3~F2~Findings~College Premium and Wage Correlation and Concerns~…while the correlation between the college premium and average college wage is positive with a magnitude of 0.33, there are occupations that offer relatively low premiums and high wages, as well as occupations that offer high premiums and relatively low wages, consistent with the equilibrium described in the empirical framework that the supply of college graduates in a given occupation depends on the relative wages offered to college gradues, as well as on individual preferences for different occupations.
163~D1, D3~F3~Findings~Aggregated Occupation Mean Premium~…aggregated occupations are spread throughout the distribution, though they have a statistically significant higher mean premium at 0.27 versus 0.22.
163~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~Mean Premium and Proportion of Graduates in Noncollege Jobs~…when the mean premium in 1994 was 0.33, about 5% of college graduates were in occupations offering a college premium of 0.10 or less, while the top 10% had premiums above 45%.

163~D1, D2, D3, D4~F5~Findings~Change in Graduate Proportion in Noncollege Jobs From 1983 to 1994~…the coefficients on the quadratic time trend, jointly signficant at the 1% level, imply that the proportion of college graduates in noncollege jobs declined significantly from 1983 to 1994 and that this decline slowed over time, suggesting that there was a sharp decline in the probability that a college graduate was employed in an occupation with a premium less than 0.10 throughout the 1980s, with a slowdown in this decline in the 1990s.

163~D1, D3, D4~F6~Findings~Researcher Occupation Definition vs. Hecker Occupation Definition Estimates~…while the researcher's series show a 6.6 percentage point decline in the proportion of college graduates in noncollege jobs from 1983 to 1994, holding all other factors constant, Heckers definition shows a 2.2 percentage point increase which is not statistically different from zero.
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Logit~…in order to assess whether the results are affected by the choice of 0.10 as the threshold premium for noncollege jobs, the logit model is reestimated using thresholds of 0.15 and 0.20.
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Altered Noncollege Job Premium Threshold ~…reestimating the logit model results with noncollege job premium thresholds of 0.15 and 0.20 leads the researchers to continue to see a significant decline in the probability of employment in noncollege jobs over the time period from 1983 to 1994
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Logit~…in order to see whether the researchers' conclusions are driven by the particular functional form used, the quadratic in year is repaced by a set of year dummy variables.
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~F8~Findings~Quadratic Form Not Driving Results~…the researchers' conclusions are not driven by the particular functional form that was used as the proportion of college workers in noncollege jobs declines sharply between 1984 and 1988, increases moderately through 1991, and then returns to its 1988 low by 1993.
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Logit~…exclude aggregated occupations and restrict to those occupations for which a college premium can be estimated in every year of the sampe period in rder to determine whether these specifications alter the significant decline in the proportion of college graduates in noncollege occupations through the 1980s and 1990s as reported in the initial logit estimates.
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Excluding Aggregated Occupations and Restricting Occupations For Which All Years Report Premiums ~…when either aggregated occupations are excluded or analysis is restricted to those occupations for which a college premium can be estimated in every year of the sample period, the sharp decline in college educated workers in noncollege occupations remains and the qualitative resuls are robust to this change, suggesting that changes in the estimates of the probability that college graduates work in noncollege jobs are not caused by changes in the mix of occupations for which college premiums are estimated.
163~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Logit~…when expanding the framework to k sectors, the model implies that college-educated workers will flow into jobs that experience skill-biased technological change.
163~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hypothetical College Graduates in Noncollege Jobs Proportion~…the proportion of college-educated workers who would have been in noncollege jobs in 1994 using the 1983 classification.

163~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Attributed Change~…the difference between the actual 1983 proportion and this hypothetical 1994 proportion gives the change attributed to changes in the allocation of college workers, holding the classification constant.
163~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Change in Classification Impact~…the impact of the change in classifcation, then, is the difference between the overall change and the change attributed to the shift in the allocation of college graduates.
163~D1, D3, D4~F10~Findings~Decline Attributions~…the decomposition of changes in classification and attributed changes indicates that 22% of the decline in the proportion of college-educated workers in noncollege jobs can be attributed to outflows from occupations initially classified as noncollege, while the remainder is attributed to changes in the compositions offering premiums below 0.10.
163~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Proportion of Workers~…employers choose the educational composition of workers on the basis of the college premium they have to pay.
163~D1, D3~V5~Variable~Occupation~…workers choose occupations on the basis of their heterogeneous preferences and the education-specific wages in each occupation.

164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source is advantageous in that it allows the drawing of a larger, more representative sample of matched husbands and wives spanning a long time period. This allows the authors to examine to what extent the correlation of spouses' labor market transitions have shifted over time, as well as how they may differ across recessions and expansions.
164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source is used to match husbands and wives for each year from 1968 to 2005. The authors then match couples' first interviews to their records in the following year, using gender, race, and age to exclude potentially invalid matches, following the algorithm suggested in Madrian and Lefgien (1999). Researchers match husbands and wives using marital status, household identifier, household type and relation of individuals to the household head. The current sample does not attempt to match across potential cohabitants. Using this method, over 97% of the individuals who report to be married and living with a spouse are matched.

Also notable is that a large fraction of unemployed women leave the labor force, a phenomenon usually labeled as the ""discouraged worker effect."" Even during expansion/expansion periods, 30.5% of unemployed women leave the labor force. This fraction is largest during periods of prolonged downturns (i.e. recession/recession periods)."

164~D1~F4~Findings~Business Cycle States and Married Couple Labor Market Transitions~…during expansion/expansion periods, 21.6% of wives whose husbands exited employment became employed, and 4.2% became unemployed. Among wives whose husbands remained employed, 18.2% became employed, and 1.8% became unemployed.
164~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Difference in Entry Rates~…the difference in entry rates between two groups at a particular two-year state in the business cycle.
164~D1~F5~Findings~Business Cycle States and Difference in Entry Rates~…during expansion/expansion periods, the difference in entry rates between the two groups, i.e. wives whose husbands remained employed and those whose husbands did not, is 5.8 percentage points. During expansion/recession periods, the difference in entry rates between wives whose husbands exited employment and wives whose husbands remained employed is 9.4 percentage points.
164~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Difference in Entry Rates~…this difference is more pronounced when the economy moves from an expansion to a recession.
164~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…researchers examine whether entry rate differences is due to observable characteristics of the wife, the husband, or the household. Additionally, the coefficients on these characteristics are examined, as well as the overall effect of a husband's exit from employment, for whether each increases or decreases over time.

164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the current data set, researchers can observe individuals' transitions across three employment states - employment (E), unemployment (U), and out of the labor force (O) - resulting in a 3x3 transition matrix contingent on the labor market state in year t and the labor market state in year t+1. Interacting husbands' and wives' employment states, couples can cycle across nine joint employment states, which produces a 9x9 joint transition matrix.

Interacting husbands' and wives' employment states, couples can cycle across nine joint employment states, which produces a 9x9 joint transition matrix.

Interacting husbands' and wives' employment states, couples can cycle across nine joint employment states, which produces a 9x9 joint transition matrix.

164~DV2~L9~Variable Value~Joint Transition Matrix~…the joint transition matrix contains a variety of information on how individuals react to their spouse's labor market status.

164~DV2~L10~Variable Value~Independent Transition Matrices~…it is possible to use the joint transition matrix to estimate individual transition matrices by averaging over spouse's labor market status.
164~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Dependence Metric~…it is possible to use the joint transition matrix to estimate individual transition matrices by averaging over spouse's labor market status. Researchers use this fact to build an alternative metric of the dependence in spousal labor supply.
164~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Dependence Metric~"…this metric is the difference between the joint transition matrix and an ""independent"" transition matrix, which is constructed by assuming independence between spouses' labor supplies."
164~DV2~L11~Variable Value~Independent Transition Matrices~…this independent transition matrix is constructed by assuming independence between spouse's labor supplies.
164~DV2~L11~Variable Value~Independent Transition Matrices~…researchers obtain the independent transition matrix by taking the Kronecker product of the estimated individual transition matrices.
164~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Distribution~…researchers find the equilibrium distribution for the joint and independent transition matrices in order to construct the equilibrium employment-population ratio for couples and other standard measures of the labor market.
164~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Employment-Population Ratio~…researchers find the equilibrium distribution for the joint and independent transition matrices in order to construct the equilibrium employment-population ratio for couples and other standard measures of the labor market.
164~DV9~L12~Variable Value~Individual Equilibrium~…at the individual level, the equilibrium is the probability distribution across employment states after the effects of initial conditions have worn off.
164~DV9~L13~Variable Value~Joint Equilibrium~…at the aggregate level, the equilibrium is a situation in which the flows of married couples across states exactly balance.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…if researchers estimate one transition for all married couples that is fixed over time, they would be forced to view any changes as a convergence to an equilibrium in which aggregate labor market states were constant. To avoid this restriction, researchers allow the transition matrix to vary across time, business cycle phases, and married couples' characteristics.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…each transition matrix is associated with the four phases of the business cycle: expansion/expansion, expansion/recession, recession/recession, and recession/expansion.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…for each business cycle phase, researchers create 16 transition matrices, one for each of the 16 possible education pairings.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…a crucial identification assumption is that, given the segmentation of the data into different business cycle phases and education groups, employment transitions are independent across households. That is, given a business cycle phase and an education group, one household's change in labor market status provides no information about another household's change.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…a Bayesian procedure is used to estimate the transition matrices. For the issues of interest in the current research, a Bayesian procedure has a number of advantages over standard maximum likelihood approaches to estimating transition matrices. In both Bayesian and MLE approaches, the basic set of observations are the normalized counts of the number of transitions. If one transition matrix was estimated for the whole sample, the two approaches would produce identical results. The way that the current authors split the sample, however, gives many joint labor market states that have no observation in one or more of the transition matrices. By adding a small amount of prior information, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to still estimate a valid transition matrix in those cases.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…in order to perform inference on the differences between the results, researchers need to generate draws of valid transition matrices that take into account the amont of sample information in the estimate. Bayesian methods allow this much more easily than maximum likelihood methods.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~"…time variation is allowed for through discounting years by their distance from the year of interest. Researchers focus on the years at the start and end of the sample (1968 and 2005) and weight transitions in years close to 1968 more heavily than those in years close to 2005, and vice versa, and label these estimates ""1968-weighted"" and ""2005-weighted"" estimates, respectively."
164~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Employment-Population Ratio~…these ratios are simulated in the following manner. Researchers start by assuming the economy has been in the expansion state for a sufficiently long time, such that the flows into and out of each labor market state are equal. In other words, for each education group, researchers solve for the equilibrium probabilities given by the expansion/expansion transition matrices. For each education , researchers then run the economy through the following sequence: 1.) a move from expansion to recession; 2.) a move from recession to recession; and 3.) a move from recession to expansion. For each education group, the simulation is run for both the joint and independent matrices and for both estimates. Finally, researchers use 10,000 draws from the set of posterior distributions and form averages across these draws for each education pairing. The authors then use each education group's population weights to form aggregate employment-to-population ratios for both types of matrices and both estimates.
164~DV9~L14~Variable Value~Continued Expansion~"…for each education group, researchers solve for the equilibrium probabilities given by the expansion/expansion transition matrices. This is called ""continued expansion."""
164~DV10~L15~Variable Value~Expansion to Recession~…in this case, researchers calculate the transitions using the transition matrix from expansion to recession and the time t probabilities verbatim and use a combination of both to compute the time employment-population for this business cycle transition state.
164~DV10~L16~Variable Value~Recession to Recession~…in this case, researchers calculate the transitions using the transition matrix from recession to recession and the time t probabilities contingent on the expansion to recession transition matrix and use both of these figures to compute the time employment-population for this business cycle transition state.
164~DV10~L17~Variable Value~Recession to Expansion~…in this case, researchers calculate the transitions using the transition matrix from recession to expansion and the time t probabilities contingent on the expansion to recession and recession to recession transition matrices and use a combination of both to compute the time employment-population for this business cycle transition sta
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…for each education group and business cycle phase, there exists both joint and independent transition matrices, and,for both of these matrices, researchers have two different estimates, one weighted towards 1968 and one weighted towards 2005.
164~D1~F9~Findings~1968 SS Employment-Populatio Ratio~…in 1968, the steady-state employment-population ratio is lower (74.2) using the joint matrix than using the independent matrix (74.2 vs. 75.9). This suggests that husbands' and wives' labor market transitions were negatively related in 1968
164~D1~F10~Findings~2005 SS Employment-Population Ratio~…the steady-state employment-population ratio using the 2005-weighted estimates show positive correlation. For example, researchers predict the employment-population ratio to be 81.8 under the independence assumption. It is actually higher (83.2) using the joint matrix.
164~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…researchers have included posterior standard deviations under each prediction. These indicate the precision of each estimate, but cannot be directly used to calculate the statistical significance of the difference between the joint and independent predictions.
164~D1~F11~Findings~ee Periods and Spousal Dependence~…in estimates that focus on the expansion/expansion phase, it is clear that the change in spousal dependence from a negative to a positive relationship is statistically significant. Specifically, the probability that the joint estimates are smaller than the independent estimates is 93% in 1968. In contrast, the probability that the joint estimates are larger than the independent estimates is 97% in 2005.
164~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…1968 estimates are less precise because of the smaller effective sample size in the earlier part of the data due to missing years in the 1970s.
164~D1~F12~Findings~1968 Joint-ness vs. Independence Employment-Population Ratios~…in 1968, from the expansion to the depth of the recession, the employment-population ratio falls approximately one percentage point, from 74.2 to 73.1. If independence between spouses is assumed, however, the ratio falls 2.3 percentage points, from 75.9 to 73.6. This suggests that spouses' negative dependence had a smoothing effect on employment fluctuations over the business cycle in the earlier period. 
164~D1~F13~Findings~2005 Joint-ness vs. Independence Employment-Population Ratios~…in 2005, the joint and independent estimates predict similar changes to those in 1968 in aggregate employment over the business cycle. Comparing the change from the expansion to the second year of the recession, it is found that the employment-population ratio fell 1.8 percentage points allowing for joint-ness and 2.0 percentage points under independence.
164~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Employment-Population Ratio~…researchers simulate aggregate employment-population ratios using the couples' joint transition matrix, as well as a hypothetical transition matrix that enforces independence.
164~V5~L18~Variable Value~Some College~…one of three education categories relevant to this research.
164~V5~L19~Variable Value~High School Graduate~…one of three education categories relevant to this research.
164~V5~L20~Variable Value~College Graduate~…one of three education categories relevant to this research.
164~D1~F14~Findings~Education Trends Over the Relevant Period~…in the earlier period (i.e. 1968 and 1973), 19.6% of couples were both high school dropouts, 23.4% were both high school graduates, and 6.8% were both college graduates. Statistical evidence shows dramatic increases in both husbands' and wives' education levels from the earlier to the later period, with 23.6% of couples both having a college degree in 2004 and 2005.
164~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Positive Assortative Matching Ratio~…to examine whether positive assortative matching on education increased over time, researchers first construct matrices of population shares in which the rows are the husbands' education levels and the columns are the wives' education levels. The sum of the diagonal cells are then divided by the sum of the off-diagonal cells.
164~D1~F15~Findings~Positive Assortative Matching Ratio Over the Relevant Period~…in the pooled 1968 and 1973 data, the positive assortative matching ratio is 1.17. By 2004 and 2005, this ratio increased to 1.31, suggesting that positive assortative mating on education did increase over this period.
164~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Employment Levels~…in order to determine how much of the emerging positive correlation in couples' employment changes can be explained by the distributional changes in education, researchers conduct a shift-share analysis in which they hold constant the estimated, education-specific transition matrices, but allow the population weights to vary, over time. In other words, researchers decompose the effect of changes in the equilibrium probabilities arising from estimates of the transtion matrices and the effect of changes in population weights. To do this, employment levels are predicted using the equilbirium probabilities for 1968 using population weights from 2005 and vice versa.
164~D1~F16~Findings~Population Weights and the Employment-Population Ratio Over the Relevant Period~…in contrast to the 1968 population weights, using the 2005 population weights reduces the negative co-movements of couples' employment substantially. For example, the employment-population ratio is 78.4 under independence and is 78.2 when the joint matrix is used, implying only slight negative co-movement within couples. This suggests that shifts in the composition of couple types, and particularly increased assortative mating based on education, matters.
164~D1~T4~Time Period~1960-2005~…since 1960, married women's labor force participation rate has doubled from 30% to over 60%. In addition, their labor force attachment has increased, as evidenced by the rise in average experience level.
164~DV2~L8~Variable Value~Added Worker Effect~…the added worker effect is still important among a subset of couples, but the overall value of marriage insurance has diminished due to the greater positive co-movement of employment within couples.
164~DV2~L8~Variable Value~Added Worker Effect~…defined as the greater propensity of married women to enter the labor force when their husband becomes unemployed.
164~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Positive Assortative Matching Ratio~…while positive assortative matching did increase over time, this shift in composition of couple types alone cannot account for the increased positive correlation.
164~D1~T5~Time Period~1968-1969~…a two-year adjacent time period categorized by expansion/expansion.

164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey is constructed such that a housing unit is interviewed for four months (Months in Sample = 1-4), rotates out of the sample for eight months, then returns for another four (Months in Sample = 5-8). For example, a unit that is first interviewed in March (Month in Sample = 1) will be re-interviewed starting in March of the next year (Month in Sample = 5). this allows potentially half of the units interviewed in a given year - those for whom Month in Sample = 1-4 - to be matched to their observations in the following year (Month in Sample = 5-8).
164~D1~V11~Variable~Month in Sample~…the Current Population Survey is constructed such that a housing unit is interviewed for four months (Months in Sample = 1-4), rotates out of the sample for eight months, then returns for another four (Months in Sample = 5-8). For example, a unit that is first interviewed in March (Month in Sample = 1) will be re-interviewed starting in March of the next year (Month in Sample = 5). this allows potentially half of the units interviewed in a given year - those for whom Month in Sample = 1-4 - to be matched to their observations in the following year (Month in Sample = 5-8).
164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…using unique record numbers available on the CPS data files constructed by the Unicon Research Corporation and the ""Month in Sample"" variable one can construct a naïve match across years. In actuality, this method leads to many false matches because the record number is unique to housing unit, not household; if, for example, a family moves out of thier house after interviews 1 to 4 and another family moves in, this method would naively match the two different families. Following recommendations in the literature by Madrian and Lefgien (1999), researchers use gender, race and age to exclude potentially invalid matches. Researchers then use marital status, household identifier, household type and relation of individuals to the ousehold head to match across couples."

164~D1~V16~Variable~Relation to Household Head~…a variable used to match husbands and wives in the CPS data.
164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1968, the CPS had 27,784 male records in the relevant age range. Of these, 81.1% were married with spouse present and matched to valid spouse observations. A well-known regarding this data is that the fraction of men who were married with spouse present fell dramatically over the span of the data, so that only 62.4% of male records were matched to spouses in 2005. For 1968, 77.7% of the potential couples were matched to observations in 1969. this match rate varies substantially across years and is particularly low during the last four years of the sample. Non-matches are due to migration, mortality, and reporting error.
164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the clear advantages of the matched March sample are its large size and the number of years it encompasses. A serious drawback is that it follows housing units, rather than households. Consequently, researchers must drop households that move due to job change or employment/non-employment transition from the matched samples.
164~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the data sample, on average, non-matched households are 2.9 years younger, slightly less eduated and slightly worse-off in terms of labor market variables compared to the matched households. Using the matched samples, then, is likely to bias upwards husbands' and wives' levels of mean employment and participation rates.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…researchers use a simple Bayesian procedure to estimate the education- and business-cycle-specific transition matrices. The crucial identification assumption is that, given the segmentation of the data into different business cycle phases and educaiton groups, employment transitions are independent across households. That is, given a business cycle phase and an education group, one household's change in labor market status provides no information about another household.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…researhcers assume a priori that each row of each transition matrix follows a Dirichlet distribution and that the rows are independent. Further, researchers assume a priori that the transition matrices are independent across business cycle phases and education groups.
164~D1~V17~Variable~Number of Employment Transitions~…used in order to calculate the probability that the husband remains or unemployed at different states in the business cycle.
164~V17~L25~Variable Value~Kee~…the observed number of employment-to-employment transitions.
164~V17~L26~Variable Value~Keu~…the observed number of employment-to-unemployment transitions.
164~V17~L27~Variable Value~Kuu~…the observed number of unemployment-to-unemployment transitions.
164~V17~L28~Variable Value~Kue~…the observed number of unemployment-to-unemployment transitions.
164~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Posterior Distribution~…the posterior distribution is obtained by simply adding the exponents and thus is proportion to the updated Dirichlet distribution.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…using a small amount of informative prior information, these Bayesian methods allow the authors to simulate draws from the posterior distribution that are valid transition matrices (i.e. they have no empty cells) and well-defined equilibrium distributions.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~…in the general case of the joint 9x9 transtion matrix estimated for each educaiton pairing and business cycle phase, for each draw from the posterior distribution, researchers also construct the smaller individual 3x3 transition matrices using standard marginalizing principles. Then, the Kronecker product of these 3x3 matrices is used as the benchmark of independence. By repeating this exercies 10,000 times, measures of the uncertainty around objects of interest, such as the employment-population ratio, can be provided. Further, one can now assess the statistical significance of the difference between the joint matrix and the independent benchmark.
164~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Labor Market Transitions~"…researchers use a simple weighting scheme to produce two estimates of transition matrices that are representative of the late 1960s and the mid 2000s. Implicitly, researchers are assuming that the transition matrices are changing across years in the sample. For the ""1968 estimates"", transitions are estimated in years closer to 1968 more than those in years closer to 2005 and vice versa for the ""2005 estimates""."

165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in combination with data from the American Time Use Survey in order to construct a measure of search effort.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…while this data reports the time spent on job-searching activities on a particular day, which is perhaps the most natural quantitative measure of job search effort, it has a small sample size and a short sample period, starting in 2003.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data does not include direct information on search time but it does include questions on the types and number of search methods used by the respondents.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…despite reporting a measure that is harder to interpret, the Current Population Survey has the advantage of a larger sample size and questions on job search that are available beginning in 1994.

165~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Aggregate Worker Search Effort~…analyzed at the individual level in detail through establishing a link between search effort and labor market outcomes.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a monthly survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics as a primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the United States.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…a relatively new survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics where individuals are drawn from the exiting samples of the Current Population Survey, being interviewed 2 to 5 months after their final Current Population Survey interview.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…through a daily diary, this data collects detailed information on the amount of time respondents devote to various activities during the day preceding their interview, while including follow-up interviews in which respondents ar re-asked a subset of the Current Population Survey questions.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…the sample from this data spans 2003 to 2011 since job-search related questions in the American Time Use Survey are consistent with the post-1994 Current Population Survey..
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~...the sample from this data is restricted from 1994 through 2011 since job-search related questions in the American Time Use Survey are consistent with the post-1994 Current Population Survey.
165~D1~T3~Time Period~2003-2011~…the survey period from which American Time Use Survey data is drawn.
165~D2~T2~Time Period~1994-2011~…the survey period from which Current Population Survey data is drawn.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all data is restricted to workers over 25 to ensure that most respondents have completed their schooling by the time of the interview, while also truncating the sample at age 70 to avoid issues related to retirement.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…all data is restricted to workers over 25 to ensure that most respondents have completed their schooling by the time of the interview, while also truncating the sample at age 70 to avoid issues related to retirement.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…this data has the advantage of having a quantifiable measure of job search effort, i.e. the number of minutes each nonemployed individuals spends on job activities..
165~D1~V1~Variable~Search Effort~…the number of minutes each nonemployed individual spends on job activities is directly reported in the American Time Use Survey, a natural measure of job search effort, paralleling hours worked in measuring the labor input for production.
165~D1~V2~Variable~Search Methods~…a collection of job search activities including job search activities, interviewing, waiting associated ith job search interview, security procedures related to job search/interviewing, and job search activities, not elsewhere specified.
165~D1~L1~Variable~Job Search Activities~…this category of search methods includes contacting employers, sending out resumes, and filling out job applications, among other activities.
165~D1~V1~Variable~Search Effort~…this effort measure does not include travel times to interviews in the baseline measure.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…in all analysis, researchers exclude the respondents who report more than 8 hours of job search activities in order to avoid the effects of large outliers.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…this data is disadvantaged in that it was a small sample size of 21,000 respondents per year and a short sample period available only from 2003; the small sample size problem is more severe than it appears, as this data  only contains information about the dat before the interview and therefore there are fewer than 100 observations per day, and the short sample period is a problem because the United States economy experience only one recession after 2003, making it difficult to detect a recurring cyclical pattern.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in order to overcome shortcomings in the American time use Survey data, Current Population Survey data is used on job search activity as well.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…conditional on the individual being unemployed and not on temporary layoff, the interview asks what kind of search methods the individual has used in the past month, in which respondents are allowed to select from nine active search methods and three passive search methods.
165~D2~V4~Variable~Number of Methods Used~…the number of job search methods used by an individual respondentas a proxy for the search effort a worker has exerted with the basis in the fact that if a worker uses six methods in one month, he/she is likely to be searching more intensely than a worker who uses only one method.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the measure of search effort using this data is advantageous over the American Time Use Survey data in that this data has a larger sample size of 150,000 individuals per month and a longer sample period, even using the sample period after the 1994 redesign; however, the main shortcoming of this proxy is that it assumes that all methods are equally important and utilized with equal intensity across individuals and over time.
165~D1~V1~Variable~Search Effort~…researchers calculate average search time for respondents of the American Time Use Survey data for respondents in different labor market states separately to identify the main drivers of search activity in the economy.
165~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Labor Market Status~…used for respondents of the American Time Use Survey data in order to group respondents into three broad categories.
165~V5~L2~Variable Value~Employed~…one broad category indicating an individual is employed at the time of survey in which respondents to the American Time Use Survey are grouped into.
165~V5~L3~Variable Value~Unemployed~…one broad category indicating an individual is unemployed at the time of survey in which respondents to the American Time Use Survey are grouped into.
165~V5~L4~Variable Value~NILF~…one broad category indicating an individual is not in the labor force at the time of survey in which respondents to the American Time Use Survey are grouped into.
165~V5~L3~Variable Value~Unemployed~…these workers are broken down into two further categories specifying for whether an individual is on temporary layoff, or waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off and do not need to have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed, or not on temporary layoff, in which these workers are the ones who report having conducted some job search activities in the last four weeks and thus are classified as unemployed.
165~V5~L4~Variable Value~NILF~…these individuals are broken down into two further categories specifying for whether an individual wants a job or whether they are simply not in the labor force by desire or other reasons.
165~V5~L4~Variable Value~NILF~…those individuals who are not in the labor force yet want a job make up a larger category than marginally attached workers, as marginally attached workers have to be available for working and have searched during the past 12 months (but not past four weeks), in addition to reporting that he/she wants a job.
165~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Unemployed, Search Effort, Number of Methods~…categorized by the number of methods they report using and plot the average minutes per day that each group spends on job search activities.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…since each respondent at the time of the interview is re-asked in which job search methods they have engaged in the past 4 weeks, researchers are able to construct a mapping between each reported method and the job search time recorded in their diary from the previous day.
165~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…running an ordinary least squares for the American Time Use Survey data with search time as the left-hand side variable and dummy variables for each method used (and variaous worker characteristics) as right-hand side variables and then using this estimated equation to compute seach time for the Current Population Survey sample starting in 1994 is the simplest approach possible.
165~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…this simple approach has some shortcomings in the fact that the search time variable has a lower bound of zero in the American Time Use Survey, but many respondents receive negative imputed minutes and in the fact that many respondents with zero search time and a positive number of methods are oberved since the American Time Use Survey asks only about the activities of the day before.
165~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Two-Step Probit Log-Linear~…in the first step, researchers estimate the probability of observing positive search time in the American Time Use Survey by running a probit model with dummy variables for each method and worker characteristics on the right-hand side and in the second step, the American Time Use Survey sample is restricted to respondents who reported strictly positive search time and run a regression with the logarithm of search time on the left-hand side and dummy varaibles for each method and worker characteristics on the right-hand side.
165~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Worker Characteristics I~…the first set of worker characterstics may affect the intensity of job search including a quartic of age, dummies for education levels, race, gender, and marital status, and an interaction term of female and married.
165~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Age~…a quartic of age included in an initial set of worker characteristics.
165~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Education Level~…a series of dummy variables for education levels.
165~V7~L5~Variable Value~High School Diploma~…a dummy variable indicating whether an individual respondent has a high school diploma.
165~V7~L6~Variable Value~Some College~…a dummy variable indicating whether an individual respondent has some college experience.
165~V7~L7~Variable Value~College Plus~…a dummy variable indicating whether an individual respondent has a college degree or more.
165~D1, D2~V8~Variable~Race~…a specification variable indicating the race of an individual respondent.
165~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Gender~…a specification variable indicating the gender of an individual respondent.
165~D1, D2~V10~Variable~Marital Status~…a specification variable indicating the marital status of an individual respondent.
165~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Female, Married~…an interaction term between female and married individuals since being married is likely to affect the labor market behavior of men and women differently.
165~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Worker Characteristics II~…the second set of worker characteristics are for labor market status.
165~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Two-Step Probit Log-Linear~…imputations for the Current Population Survey sample are conducted by using the estimated coefficients to first generate a probability of non-zero search time, then generating an expected search time conditional on observing any search, and then multiplying the outcomes.
165~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Unemployed, Search Effort, Number of Methods~…only 20% of the unemployed searchers reported positive search time on the day of the interview.
165~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Labor Market Status~…controls for labor force status are intended to caputrue the search time for the respondents who do not answer the Current Population Survey job questions on job search methods but still report positive search time.
165~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~NILF, Want a Job~…a dummy variable specifying for those individuals that are out of the labor force that want a job.
165~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~NILF, Don’t Want a Job~…a dummy variable specifying for those individuals that are out of the labor force that don't want a job.
165~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Temporary Layoff~…a dummy variable specifying for those individuals that are on temporary layoff.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…the imputed minutes track the actual minutes very closely, with the exception of 2004 and 2005.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…this measure weights each search method differently accoriding to the estimated time intensity and allows for baseline search effort to vary by demographic characteristics.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…one critical assumption embedded in the imputation method is that the relationship between the methods used and the number of search minutes is constant over time.
165~D1, D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Extensive Margin~…represented by the number of unemployed workers relative to total nonemployment.
165~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Intensive Margin~…measured as the average search time in minutes per day that unemployed workers spend on job search activities.
165~D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Fraction of Nonworking Searchers~…calculated as the fraction of nonworkers who decided to engage in search, which is computed by the ratio of unemployed workers to all nonemployed workers.
165~V5~L8~Variable Value~Nonemployed Workers~…calculated as the number of unemployed workers plus the number of NILF workers.
165~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Recessionary Impact on Search Time~…workers on average spend more time searching during recessionary periods with the correlation with the cyclical component of GDP equalling -0.55.
165~D1, D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Extensive Margin~…this measure does not capture the full extensive margin in the data, as researchers find evidence in the American Time Use Survey of job search among some non-participants and employed
165~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Search Effort of Nonemployed Workers~…the total search effort of nonemployed workers in the economy can be calculated as the extensive margin time the intensive margin.
165~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Search Effort of Nonemployed Workers~…this calculation assumes that nonparticipants do not spend any time searching; however since some nonparticipants report positive search minutes, this computed measure is slightly different from the total search effort of nonemployed workers that is directly measured in the dataset.
165~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Intensive Margin~…failing to take into account the variation in the intensive margin of search intensity results in an underestimation of the variation of total search effort in the economy over the business cycle.
165~D1, D2~DV13~Derived variable~HP-filtered State-Level Unemployment Rate~…as a measure of the business cycle at the state level.
165~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~HP-filtered Real State Level Gross Product~…as a measure of the business cycle at the state level.
165~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…this method is used to examine the cyclicality at the state-level where the cyclical component of average search time in a particular state in a specific time period is the outcome, and explanatory variables include state fixed effects, a time control, a measure of the business cycle in the state in the time period, and an error term.
165~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Cyclical Component of Average Search Time~…the cyclical component of average search time in a state at a specific time as the outcome of regressions examining the cyclicality at the state-level.
165~D1, D2~V11~Variable~State Fixed Effect~…a state fixed effect included in all regressions examining the cyclicality at the state-level.
165~D1, D2~V11~Variable~State Fixed Effect~…capture any static difference in job search behavior across states.
165~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~HP-filtered Real State Level Gross Product~…the main parameter of interest captures the correlation of search time with the business cycle, or more explicitly the correlation of the cyclical component of search time with the cyclical variation of market indicators.
165~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~HP-filtered State-Level Unemployment Rate~…the main parameter of interest captures the correlation of search time with the business cycle, or more explicitly the correlation of the cyclical component of search time with the cyclical variation of market indicators.
165~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Time Control I~…in the first variation, researchers include time fixed effects which control flexibly for any variation that is constant across states but varies over time.
165~D1, D2~DV17~Derived Variable~Time Control II~…in the second variation, researchers add state-specific linear time trends, which allow for each state to experience a different linear time trend, controlling for time-varying state level policies that may affect trends in job search differentially.
165~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Time Control I~…researchers control for differing seasonality in the cross-state data using two alternate methods including state-specific month dummies and seasonally adjusting the data state by state.
165~D1, D2~DV17~Derived Variable~Time Control II~…researchers control for differing seasonality in the cross-state data using two alternate methods including state-specific month dummies and seasonally adjusting the data state by state.
165~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Unemployment Trend Impact on Search Time~…coefficient estimates suggest that if the unemployment rate is 2 percentage points above trend, then workers search an extra minute per day.
165~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Marginal Increase in Job Finding Probability~…if the marginal increase in the job-finding probability due to increases in effort is inversely related to labor demand conditions, the worker would increase her search in recessions.
165~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Unemployment Insurance Benefits~…if workers are responsive to the generosity of unemployment benefits, the extension of benefits that usually accompanies recessions is likely to decrease search effort among workers who are eligible for unemployment benefits.
165~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Unemployed, Search Effort, Number of Methods~…determines where the pool of unemployed workers has shifted during certain times in the business cycle.
165~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability~…in order to explicitly estimate the effect of observed changes in the pool of unemployed on the cyclicality of search effort at the extensive margin, researchers first estimate a linear probability model where a binary variable specifying for unemployment is the outcome, and explanatory variables consist of characteristic controls,a month dummy variable and an error term.
165~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Month~…a month dummy variable that takes 1 if the observation takes place in the same time period as state effects and 0 otherwise.
165~D1, D2~V14~Variable~Unemployment Status~…a dummy variable that equals 0 if an individual is unemployed and 0 if an individual is not unemployed.
165~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Gender Search Patterns~…women are less likely to search and, conditional on searching at all, search for fewer minutes, for finding is even more pronounced for married women with significnat coefficients on extensive margins of -0.067 and intensive margins of -5.908 and -26.185 respectively.
165~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Search Effort and Margins~…search effort on both the intensive and extensive margin is increasing with education with significant coefficients on the intensive margins ranging from 4.591 to 43.393.
165~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Search Effort and Occupation~…coefficients on the occupation categories reveal that workers from non-routine occupations search more than those in routine occupations, with those in cognitive non-routine occupations searching the most and those in non-cognitive routine occupations searching the least with an intensive margin of -9.518 (the cognitive non-routine was excluded to avoid perfect collinearity).
165~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Search Effort and Age~…search effort is relatively invariant to age until around 50 and then declines.
165~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Unemployment Pool Changes~…changes in the unemployed pool across observables explains 45% of the rise in the intensive margin in the 2001 recession and 62% of the rise in the intensive margin in the 2007 to 2009 regression, thus about half of the countercyclical movement of the intensive margin is explained by the shift in observable characteristics.
165~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Month~…the coefficients of month dummies are seasonally adjusted to be comparable with other time-series results.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…in order to examine search effort at the individual level to understand the reasons behind the countercyclicality of the job search effort beyond observable compositional shifts, regressions are run where job search effort is the outcome, and explanatory variables include the logarith of labor market conditions, a wealth variable, a vector of controls associated with a coefficient vector, and an error term.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…regressions run examining individual level search effort focus on the intensive margin.

165~D3~D3~Dataset~Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey~…data used in order to compute the aggregate labor market tightness with specification for vacancy and unemployment.
165~D3~V15~Variable~Vacancy~...the vacancy of the labor market used in order to determine the aggregate labor market tightness.
165~D3~V16~Variable ~Unemployment~…the overall unemployment of the labor market in order to determine the aggregate labor market tightness.
165~D2, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Aggregate Labor Market Tightness~…the vacancy of the labor market divided by the overall unemployment of the labor market.
165~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Wealth Measure I~…the first alternative aggregate measure of wealth is the S&P 500.
165~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Wealth Measure II~…the second alternative aggregate measure of wealth is the aggregate Core-Logic house price index.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…the sample for this regression includes only those unemployed who are not on temporary layoff because the search methods are the main time varying factors in creating the imputed search time and researchers do not observe the search methods for the workers on temporary layoff.
165~D3~D3~Dataset~Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey~
165~D1, D2~V17~Variable~Occupation~…a series of four occupational categories in order to specify for differentiation in search effort across occupation.

165~V17~L12~Variable Value~Manual/Routine~…an occupational category used in order to differentiate search effort by occupation.
165~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Labor Market Attachment~…one component of the unobserved heterogeneity that can affect the cyclicality of job search effort is an individual's labor market attachment, which is typically hard to observe and affect the individual's desire to work.
165~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Labor Market Attachment~…controlled for by using prior labor market status of unemployed workers as a proxy for labor force attachment by using Current Population Survey microdata matched across all eight survey months.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to control for labor force attachment, researchers use Current Population Survey microdata matched across all eight survey months.
165~D2~V18~Variable~Prior Labor Market Status~…researchers define prior status as a workers labor market status 12 months ago and therefore, only include people who were unemployed at some point in the 5th to the 8th month in the survey and who researchers are abe to match to their survey exactly one year ago.
165~V18~L13~Variable Value~Prior Unemployed~…indicates that an individual was unemployed 12 months ago.
165~V18~L14~Variable Value~Prior Employed~…indicates that an individual was employed 12 months ago.
165~V18~L15~Variable Value~Prior NILF~…indicates that an individual was not in the labor force 12 months ago.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…note that there is an eight month break between the fourth survey and the fifth survey.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…to separate the effects of observed and unobserved heterogeneity on the estimated responsivness of individuals to labor market conditions, researchers estimate three versions of the regression with the first not including any observable controls in order to capture a simple correlation with labor market conditions, the second including observable controls but not including the labor force attachment variable in order to isolate the effect of observed heterogeneity, and the third includes both observable controls and the labor force attachment variables illustrating the effects of unobserved heterogeneity.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…researchers run two sets of regresions, one for each of the wealth variables.
165~D2~V18~Variable~Prior Labor Market Status~…note that these variables only contain information on the employment status 12 months before unemployment and do not control for labor market transitions within this 12 month period.
165~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~Log Labor Force Conditions Results w/o Attachment or Demographic Proxies~…when researchers do not include either a proxy for labor force attachment or demographic controls, the coefficient on the log of labor force conditions is negative and significant at -1.548, confirming that search effort is low when aggregate labor market conditions are favorable.
165~D1, D2, D3~F9~Findings~Demographic Composition of Unemployment and Cyclicality of Search Effort~…shifts in the demographic composition of the unemployed contirbute meaningfully to the cyclicatllity of aggregate search effort, decreasing the estimated individual sensitity to labor market conditions by about 50% with coefficients changing from -1.548 to -0.754 with the downward bias coming from the fact that in periods when labor market conditions are unfavorable, the unemployed pool is composed of individuals who are ex-ante high searching types.
165~D1, D2, D3~F10~Findings~Nonparticipants and Degree of Attachment~…workers who were nonparticipants a year ago, and thus had the lowest degree of attachment, have the lowest job search effort, with coefficients on prior unemployed and prior employed equalling 4.674 and 6.449 respectively relative to those prior not in the labor force.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the full panel structure of this data is exploited in some regressions in order to more explicitly account for potential unobserved heterogeneity with individual fixed effects.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…in order to more explicitly account for potential unobserved heterogeneity, reserachers run subsequent regressions of this form with individual fixed effects; assuming that an individual's unobserved characteristics related to search effort do not change over the sample period, this specification directly controls for all compositional bias.
165~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~Individual Fixed Effects~…when these effects are controlled for, researchers only use individuals with at least 2 periods of unemployment in the eight months in which they are surveyed.
165~D1, D2, D3~M4~Methodology~Linear-Log~…when controlling for individual fixed effects, researchers run regressions on a modified sample including only those individuals with at least 2 period of unemployment in the eight months in which they are surveyed, reported through three regressions, the first of which has no demographic controls, the second of which includes demographic controls, and the third of which includes individual fixed effects.
165~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~Demographic Composition of Unemployment and Correlation of Search Effort and Labor Market Conditions~…observed changes in the composition of the unemployed is important in explaining the correlation of search effort and labor market conditions with coefficients of -2.073 and -0.875 respectively for the S&P wealth measure and -2.351 and -1.046 respectively for the House Price wealth measure.
165~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~individual Fixed Effects and Search Effort~…a comparison of the results with and without fixed effects on the sample suggests that introducing fixed effects tends to make individual search effort less responsive to labor market conditions with coefficients of -0.875 and -0.295 respectively for the S&P wealth measure and -1.046 and -0.980 respectively for the House Price wealth measure, with the coefficient on the labor market condition variable in the S&P wealth measure, with the inclusion of individual fixed effects, losing its statistical significance.
165~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~Search Effort Over Relevant Time Period~…through a back of the envelope calculation using the regression coefficients from the linear-log regressions, researchers document that over the relevant period, the search effort went from an average of 32 minutes per day to an average of 38 minutes per day.
165~D1, D2, D3~F14~Findings~Labor Market Condition Explanatory Weight~…the coefficient on labor market conditions suggest that the response of individual search effort to weak labor market conditions explains 7% to 22% of the rise in search effort over the recent recession.
165~D1, D2, D3~F15~Findings~Labor Market Condition Explanatory Weight by Wealth Measure~…the coefficient on labor market conditions with wealth as measuresd through the Core-Logic house price index explains between 15% to 17% and wealth as measured by the S&P 500 index explains 27% to 44% of the rise in search effort over the recent recession.
165~D1, D2, D3~F16~Findings~Individual Responses to Labor Market Conditions Explanatory Weight~…in each regression, individual responses to labor market conditions explain between 33% and 57% of the increase in search effort, whereas the remaining variation can therefore be attributed to shifts in the composition of the unemployed, either observed or unobserved.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…microdata matched across all eight survey months used in order to establish the link between search effort and indiivdual labor market outcomes by starting with a set of respondents who report being unemployed at the time of the survey in a specific month and record their labor market statues in three subsequent months, and then one year and three subsequent months after that.
165~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Successful Employment~…a worker is considered to be successful at finding a job before n months if a worker who is unemployed at a specific time experiences employment before a specific time plus n.
165~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Successful Employment~…an individual with a history of persistent unemploment and employment then unemployment at time t to t+3 is considered unsuccessful in finding a job before one month ahead by considered as successful before two and three months ahead.
165~D1, D2~M5~Methodology~Logit~…in order to isolate the effect of search effort measured in a specific month on successful job finding, regressions are run separately where the outcome is the indicator that takes the value of 1 if individual reports being employed at least for one month within the next n months.
165~D2, D3~V20~Variable~n-Month Employment~…a binary variable as the outcome of the isolation of search effort effects in the logit regressions where the indicator takes the value of 1 if an individual reports being employed at least for one month within the next n months.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…due to the interview structure of the Current Population Survey, respondents are not interviewed between months t+3 and t+12.
165~D2, D3~F17~Findings~Vacancy Unemployment Ratio and Search Effort~...for a vacancy-unemployment ratio of 0.4, an additional half an hour of job search per day increases the likelihood of being employed within the next year by 3.7 percentage points.
165~D2, D3~F18~Findings~Search time and n-Month Employment~…unemployed individuals who reported searching for a longer period of time were more likely to report being employed at some point in the next 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, and 15 months.
165~D2, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Aggregate Labor Market Tightness~…the average value of this ratio for the JOLTS sample period is 0.14.
165~D3~T4~Time Period~2001-2014~…the sample period from which Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data is drawn.
165~D3~D3~Dataset~Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey~…all data from this dataset is drawn from the sample period from December 2001 to April 2014.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…as individuals are only interviewed 8 times over a 16 month span, researchers are not able to match individuals to their status both 1 year ago and 1 year in the future.
165~D1, D2, D3~M6~Methodology~Log-Log~…where the log of the job finding probability is the outcome and explanatory variables include the log aggregate labor market tightness, the vector of month dummies for each month of a year, the log of the average value of imputed search minutes for unemployed workers, a dummy variable for observations after July 2009, and an error term. 
165~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Month~…a vector of month dummies for each month of a year.
165~D2, D3~DV25~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…the probability of finding a job for each individual in a specific time period.
165~D2, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Aggregate Labor Market Tightness~…the ratio of the number of vacancies and the number of unemployed at a specific time, the log of which is included in log-log regressions on job-finding probability.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…the average value of imputed search minutes for unemployed workers, the log of which is included in log-log regressions on the job-finding probability.
165~D1, D2, D3~V21~Variable~39995.0~…a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 after July 2009, which is intended to control for a recent large decline in matching efficiency.
165~D3~D3~Dataset~Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey~…data from this survey is used to estimate the log-log regressions on the job finding probability.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey~…data from this survey is used to estimate the log-log regressions on the job finding probability limited to the period from December 2000 to December 2011.
165~D2~T5~Time Period~2000-2011~…a limited sample period of the Current Population Survey from December 2000 to December 2011 to estimate the relationship of log-log regressions on job-finding probability.
165~D2, D3~DV25~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…the job finding probability is obtained by dividing the hires variable in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey by the number of unemployed in the Current Population Survey.
165~D3~V22~Variable~Hires~…the number of hires available in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey used in conjuction with unemployment numbers to calculate the job finding probablility.
165~D2~V16~Variable~Unemployment~…the number of unemployed individuals in the Current Population Survey sample used in conjuction with the hires variable in order to calculate the job finding probability and in conjuction with the number of vacancies in order to calculate the aggregate labor market tightness.
165~D2, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Aggregate Labor Market Tightness~…this variable is computed by dividing the vacancy variable in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey by the number of unemployed in the Current Population Survey.
165~D2, D3~F19~Findings~Importance of Job Search Variation~…the coefficient on the log of the average value of imputed search minutes for unemployed workers is positive and significant at the 1% level with a value of 0.455, suggesting the importance of the variation in job search effort.
165~D2, D3~F20~Findings~Imputed Search Time and Aggregate Labor Market Tightness~…since search effort rises when the labor market is weaker, the inclusion of the log of the average value of imputed search minutes for unemployed workers increases the estimated coefficient on the log of the aggregate labor market tightness from a significant 0.746 to a significant 0.818.
165~D2, D3~F21~Findings~Job Finding Probability Early and Late in Recession~…the job-finding probability went down from an average of 28% in 2007 to 17% in 2009, while during the same time period, search effort went up from an average of 32 minutes per day in 2007 to an average of 38 minutes per day in 2009; since 0.455 x (log(38)-log(32)) = 0.078, if labor conditions and aggregate labor market tightness had stayed the same and only search effort had risen, the job finding probability would have increased to 28 x exp(0.078) = 30%., that is, the search effort's contribution during this period was to increase the job-finding probability by 2 percentage points, meaning that without the increase in search effort, the job-finding probability would have been 15% instead of 17%.
165~D1, D2, D3~F22~Findings~Unemployment Insurance Benefits Eligibility Early and Late in Recession~…the average number of weeks of unemployment insurance benefits remaining among the eligible unemployed was 12 in 2007 and rose to 33 in 2009, suggesting a decline of 0.5 minutes, or 1.5% of total search time.
165~D2~V23~Variable~Unemployment Insurance Benefits Eligibility~…workers who are eligible for unemployment insurance benefits are likely to be different from other unemployed workers not only in their receipt of benefits but also in their unobservable characteristics, mainly in their labor force attachment.
165~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Observable Characteristics and Labor Force Attachment and Search Time~…even after controlling for other observable characteristics and the researchers proxy for labor force attachment, eligible unemployed workers search more with coefficients of 4.979 and 4.950, respectively for each wealth measure, an effect that is large and statistically significant.
165~D2~V23~Variable~Unemployment Insurance Benefits~…the eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits may be serve as an additional proxy for unobserved characteristics that are not captured in observable characteristics or prior employment status.
165~D1, D2~F24~Findings~Fraction of Unemployed Unemployment Benefits Eligibility Early and Late in Recession~…the fraction of unemployed who are eligible for unemployment benefits increases sharply during recessions, from around 0.55 in 2007 to around 0.75 in 2009, suggesting, when accounting for the fact that eligibility coefficients were high as well, that the changing composition of the unemployed along this dimension dominates the disincentive effects of unemployment insurance extensions at the individual level.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…from this data source, researchers use the Multi-Year microdata files which are advantageous in the fact that as opposed to the individual year files in that they provide consistent population weights across years; however it comes at the cost of slightly less detailed job search categories.
165~D1~V2~Variable~Search Methods~…defined to include all search, interview and time spent at the interview location with the exception of time spent travelling to interviews as the Multi-Year files do not provide data at the full level of disaggregation.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…researchers restrict respondents to those between the age of 25 and 70, while also dropping individual who report more than 8 hours of search in each day, ultimately excluding only 33 respondents or around 2.5% of the active searchers (annual this leaves the researchers with around 2,500 nonemployed respondents, around 400 classified unemployed active searchers and 130 respondents who report positive search time.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…monthly basic samples from January 1994 through December 2011 restrited to include only respondents between 25 and 70 years old leaving researchers with approximately 20,000 nonemployed individuals and on average 2,000 unemployed searchers each month.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in order to run individual-level regression, researchers match the sample across the eight survey months, with the ability to match 93% to at least 1 other month of the survey, 60% of respondents to at least 4 months and 40% across all 8 survey months.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…in order to obtain an imputed job search time for each individual respondent of the Current Population Survey, researchers generate an indicator variable for whether or not the individual reported positive search minutes in the American Time Use Survey time diary, run a positive regression with this dummy variable on the left-hand side and the characteristics of the corresponding American Time Use Survey sample on the right-hand, and then use the estimated coefficients from this estimate and the characteristics of the Current Population Survey sample to calculate a predicted value (1)  and then calculate a predicted value (2) by using the subset of the American Time Use Survey sample who reports strictly positive minutes and then run a log-linear regression for the American Time Use Survey sample where the error term is assumed to be normally distributed mean zero and then for then transfer this to the Current Population Survey data form the property of the lognormal distribution; finally multiply both of these predicted values together to calculate imputed job search time.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…through this method, researchers are able to impute a strictly non-negative amount of search time for all nonemployed in both the American Time Use Survey and Current Population Survey given their reported search methods and observables.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…a simple method for computing imputed search time using the relationship between reported search time and the number of minutes is to run a simple Ordinary Least Squares regression using reported time on the left-hand side and dummy variables for each method and other characteristics on the right-hand side.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…both the two-step method and the simple ordinary least squares regression produce similar results.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…in each imputation method, it is assumed that the search time (or the log of search time) for a given search method is constant over time, an assumption that is crucial for the researcher's imputation exercise.
165~D2~V4~Variable~Number of Methods Used~…because the number of search methods is limited both in practice and by the Current Population Survey design, where people are only able to report up to 6 of 12 possible search methods, individuals could increase their search effort while keeping their number of methods constant by varying the intensity with which they use each method.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the number of search methods imposed in the Current Population Survey sample is binding for only 2% and therefore it is not likely to bias the results.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…the number of search methods imposed in the American Time Use Survey sample is binding for only 2% and therefore it is not likely to bias the results.
165~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…used to estimate whether the limited number of reportable methods is responsible for driving the results first by including year dummies in the regression
165~D1, D2~F27~Findings~Search Time Decline From 2004 to 2005~…there is a decline in search time in 2004 to 2005 that is not mirrored in the number of methods moving from highly significant coefficients of -1.95 to -2.06, suggesting that the imputation method overestimates the total search time in 2004 and 2005.
165~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…to further explore the possibility that the relationship between search methods and search time varies over time, researchers break data into a pre-recession and a post-recession sample and then calculate the impute imputed minutes for each subsample and explore the in and out of sample fit.
165~D1~T6~Time Period~Pre-Recession~…researchers break data into a pre-recession time period including 2003 to 2007 to further explore the possibility that the relationship between search methods and search time varies over time.
165~D1~T7~Time Period~Post-Recession~…researchers break data into a post-recession time period including 2008 to 2011 to further explore the possibility that the relationship between search methods and search time varies over time.
165~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…researchers use this regression to explore the effect of including aggregate macro-economic indicators in the imputation procedure by including each aggregate measure separately and interacted with each search method, essentially allowing the relationship between search time and a particular search method to vary over the business cycle.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…this benchmark method is a conservative one in terms of representing the cyclicality of search effor.
165~D1, D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Extensive Margin~…used in order to examine the robustness of aggregate results.
165~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Intensive Margin~…used in order to examine the robustness of aggregate results.
165~D2~V4~Variable~Number of Methods Used~…researchers use measure weights on each search method differently according to the time estimated.
165~D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Imputed Job Search Time~…this measure allows for baseline search effort to vary by demographic characteristics.
165~D1, D2~F25~Findings~Imputed Search Minutes and Average Number of Methods Correlation~…the two search effort estimates, imputed minutes and average number of methods, have a correlation of 0.94, but it is seen that the imputed minutes measure of search effort is more volatile than the simple count of the number of methods, suggesting that either individuals shift to more time intensive search methods in recessions or that the composition of the unemployed pool shifts towards higher search demographics over the business cycle.
165~D2~T1~Time Period~Pre-1994~…time period in which the Current Population Survey basic monthly survey allowed respondents to report up to six job search methods from a list of six possible methods limited to contacting a private employment agency, contacting employers directly, asking friends or relatives, placing or responding to ads, and other.
165~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…before 1994, the Current Population Survey basic monthly survey allowed respondents to report up to six job search methods from a list of six possible methods limited to contacting a private employment agency, contacting employers directly, asking friends or relatives, placing or responding to ads, and other, in which the first five of these major search methods are also options after the 1994 redesign as well.
165~D1, D2~F26~Findings~Great Recession Eligibility for Those Unemployed/Employed 1 year Prior~…during the Great Recession, around 70% of the eligible unemployed was employed 1 year ago, as compared with only around 40% of the noneligible unemployed, suggesting that eligible workers are more strongly attached to the labor force than those who are not eligible.
165~D2~V18~Variable~Prior Labor Market Status~…when controlling for prior labor market status, researchers limit the sample to include only those individuals who were able to be matched to the survey 1 year ago.
165~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~Individual Fixed Effects~…when controlling for individual fixed effects, researchers limit the sample to include only those individuals who were observed to be unemployed for at least 2 periods.
165~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…due to the small sample size of the Current Population Survey, unemployment counts become unreliable for small labor markets making it impossible to compute labor market tightness.
166~166: Job Stability in the United States~~~~
166~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
166~D1~V1~Variable~Wage~…as a key attribute of a job.
166~D1~DV1~Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…as a key attribute of a job.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in order to examine the temporal evolution of job retention rates in the United States labor markets.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…drawing data from the tenure supplements issued periodically by the Bureau of the Census that ask workers how long they have been with their current employer or at their current job.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…drawing data from the general survey in order to collect information on charactersitics and other variables administered to the same set of individuals as in the tenure supplements.
166~D1~DV1~Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…as a job retention rate which gives the proability that a worker will have an additional t years of tenure t years hence.
166~D1~DV1~Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…may be defined for any subgroup of the population, such as demographic groups or workers with particular initial tenure levels.
166~D1~V2~Variable~Current Tenure~…the number of years a certain individual has been employed at a certain firm as important in determining the t-year retention rate.
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…a sequence of retention rates is referred to as a survival function which provides a complete characteriziation of the probability distribution of eventual tenure.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…captures incomplete spells, that is, completed tenure-to-date for people's current jobs, which makes the estimation of tenure distributions complicated.
166~D1~DV2~Variable~Potential Tenure~…because the Current Population Survey captures incomplete spells, the distribution of eventual tenure cannot be observed, but only inferred by estimating the survival function for employment.
166~D1~V3~Variable~Arrival Rate~…this research assumes that the overall arrival rate, i.e. the number of workers beginning new jobs, remains constant.
166~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Historical Retention Rates~…independent of changes in arrival rates because they are calculated from data on the same cohort at two points of time.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…tenure supplements available for 1973, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1987, and 1991.
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…conditional on any characteristic, we can estimate the t-year retention rate for the span of years, t, between any two tenure supplements in the Curret Population Survey.
166~D1~T1~Time Period~1973-1991~…time period from which Current Population Survey data is drawn, yet only from the years in which the tenure supplements were included (i.e. 1973, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1987, and 1991).
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…the basic t-year retention rate for workers with c years of tenure is estimated as the ratio of the number of workers with t + c years of tenure in the tenure supplement t years hence, to the number of workers with c years of tenure in the current tenure supplement.
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…retention rates can be estimated for any subgroup consistently represented across surveys.

166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…compared in order to investigate whether job stability has remained stable over time.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1973, 1978 and 1981, the questions on the tenure supplements referred to time working at the present job or business as current tenure, while in 1983, 1987, and 1991, the question referred to time working continuously for the present employer, thus, to be safe, the researchers are careful to focus on changes in retention rates that are not influenced by changes in the wording of the tenure question.
166~D1~T2~Time Period~1973-1981~…time period in which tenure supplement questions of the Current Population Survey referred to the time working at the present job or business as current tenure.
166~D1~T3~Time Period~1983-1991~…time period in which tenure supplement questions of the Current Population Survey referred to the time working continuously for the present employer as current tenure.
166~D1~V2~Variable~Current Tenure~…inconsistent in that in 1973, 1978 and 1981, the tenure supplement of the Current Population Survey asks questions referring to the time working at the present job or business, while in 1983, 1987 and 1991, the question referred to time working continuously for the present employer, limiting the usefulness of some comparisons.
166~DV1~L1~Variable Value~4-year Retention Rates~…for the years 1983 and 1987 as the most consistent comparisons as these retention rates rely on a consistent tenure question.
166~D1~T4~Time Period~1983-1987~…time period from which the most consistent comparisons of retention rates can be made.
166~DV1~L2~Variable Value~5-year Retention Rates~…comparisons of the 5-year retention rates are problematic because researchers cannot identify true changes in isolation from changes due to different question types.
166~DV1~L3~Variable Value~8-year Retention Rates~…comparisons of the 8-year retention rates are problematic because researchers cannot identify true changes in isolation from changes due to different question types.
166~DV1~L4~Variable Value~10-year Retention Rates~…despite changes in the tenure questions, a comparison of 10-year retention rates for 1973 and 1981 is possible because for each of these years retention rates are based on the early tenure question in the initial year and the later tenure question in the final year; while estimates of retention rates for either 1973 or 1981 may be biased because of the change in the questions, an unbiased estimate of the change in the retention rate from 1973 to 1981 can be obtained if the estimated retention rate for each year is equally biased.
166~DV1~L1~Variable~4-year Retention Rates~…as the main focus of this paper due to potential problems with other t-year retention rates.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…limited to nonagricultural workers, currently working or with a job but not currently at work, aged 16 or older.
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…estimated based on comparing the number of workers between different Current Population Survey samples, making it important for the samples to be representative of the population in order to insure unbiased comparisons.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…is ideal for drawing true representative samples because it is a random sample representative of the United States population, with weights already provided for each sample individual.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…nonresponse to the tenure supplement can vary across years and can vary differently based on demographics or other characteristics, therefore the researchers adjust the standard Current Population Survey sample weight by multiplying by the reciprocal of the response rate to the tenure question for each race-age-sex subgroup, with age grouped into 5-year intervals.
166~V8~L5~Variable Value~Agriculture~…exclusion of workers from this industry is routinely done in the wage distribution of the literature that this article seeks to complement, however researchers include agricultural workers in final regressions to show the sensitivity of their inclusion.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey sample weight is the reciprocal of the probability of being sampled, adjusted for noninterview and variation in the sampling of race, age, sex, and residence subgroups.
166~V2~L6~Variable Value~1 to 2 Years~…for 1983, 1987, and 1991, the proportion reporting tenure of 1 to 2 years is lower than the proportion reporting tenure of 2 to 3 years, a difference that surely arises because of the wording of the tenure question, which leads to a phenomenon called rounding.
166~V2~L7~Variable Value~2 to 3 Years~…for 1983, 1987, and 1991, the proportion reporting tenure of 1 to 2 years is lower than the proportion reporting tenure of 2 to 3 years, a difference that surely arises because of the wording of the tenure question, which leads to a phenomenon called rounding.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the 1983 and subsequent surveys, the tenure question asks how long a person has worked for his present employer and if the answer is less than 1 year, the respondent is queried as to length of tenure in months, otherwise the answer is recorded in years leading individuals to round up in the 12 to 24 month range.
166~D1~D1~Datset~Current Population Survey~…before 1983, the survey asks for the year in which the spell of tenure began, so the problem of rounding does not arise.
166~D1~V2~Variable~Current Population Survey~…a second feature of the empirical tenure distributions is that the 1983, 1987, and 1991 distributions have spikes at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years, which indicates an issue of heaping.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…for the tenure supplement in 1983 and beyond, the tenure question leads to an issue of heaping because of rounding with regard to the number of years for which a respondent has worked for the present employer, while in the pre-1983 supplements in which respondents reported the year they began the tenure spell, any such heaping is much less evident.
166~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~True Tenure~…to adjust for rounding and heaping, researchers estimate a mixture model for reported tenure that is then used to reallocate the rounded and heaped data, modelled with a Weibull distribution assuming that individuals report true tenure with probability p and report a nearby multiple of five with proability 1 - p.
166~D1~V10~Variable~Probability of True Reporting~…p is the probability that individuals report true tenure, while 1 - p is the proability that individuals report a nearby multiple of five.
166~D1~V10~Variable~Probability of True Reporting~…researchers allow p to depend linearly on reported tenure.
166~D1~V2~Variable~Current Tenure~…reported tenure distribution differs from the the true probability distribution due to rounding, heaping and sampling.
166~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~True Tenure~…reported tenure distribution differs from the the true probability distribution due to rounding, heaping and sampling.
166~D1~V11~Variable~Cyclical Fluctuations~…business cycles may influence estimates of retention rates as fluctuations in unemployment affect the probability of termination, independently of underlying changes in job retention rates.
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…adjusted for cyclical fluctions by, in effect, adding back cyclical job terminations.
166~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Cyclical Position of Unemployment~…the researchers proxy for the cyclical position of unemployment is the residual from a regression of the monthly civilian unemployment rate on a linear time trend separately classifying by sex, race, and age.
166~V4~L8~Variable Value~16 to 20 Years~…as a demographic subgroup of age in order to classify for the cyclical position of unemployment..
166~V4~L9~Variable Value~20+ Years~…as a demographic subgroup of age in order to classify for the cyclical position of unemployment..
166~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Cyclical Position of Unemployment~…adjustments for the cyclical position of unemployment lower retention rates estimated over expansions and raises retention rates estimated over contractions, with the size of the adjustment depending on the average deviation of changes in the unemployment rate from trend over the span.
166~D1~F1~Findings~Economywide 4-year Retention Rate from 1983 to 1987~…the unadjusted economywide 4-retention rate decreased from 0.576 to 0.557 between the 1983 and the 1987 spans, with results for retention rate changes between spans experiencing a qualitatively similar estimated decline of 0.024.
166~D1~F2~Findings~Impact of Heaping Adjustments on 4-year Retention Rates~…the effect of the heaping adjustment is found to smooth retention rates between years of tenure, for example the 1983 unadjusted retention rate for 6 to <7 years of current tenure is 1.136, which is theoretically impossible, while the adjusted retention rate is 0.666, which is consistent with estimated retention rates for workers with similar years of current tenure.
166~V2~L10~Variable Value~0 to <2 Years~…as a broader focus tenure group chosen to simplify the presentation by combining workers experiencing similar changes between spans.
166~V2~L11~Variable Value~2 to <9 Years~…as a broader focus tenure group chosen to simplify the presentation by combining workers experiencing similar changes between spans.
166~V2~L12~Variable Value~9 to <15 Years~…as a broader focus tenure group chosen to simplify the presentation by combining workers experiencing similar changes between spans.
166~D1~F3~Findings~4-year Retention Rates by Tenure Group w/o Business Cycle Adjustments~…without business-cycle adjustment, the 4-year retention rates significantly decrease by 0.061 for the 2 to <9 tenure group from 1983 to 1987, while the 4-year retention rates significantly increase for the 15+ tenure group by 0.025.
166~D1~F4~Findings~Economywide 4-year Retention Rate w/ and w/o Business Cycle Adjustments~…with business cycle adjustments, the economy wide 4-year retention rates significantly decrease by 0.10, while without business cycle adjustments, the economy wide retention rates significantly decrease by 0.24.
166~D1~F5~Findings~Average Job Tenure w/ and w/o Business Cycle Adjustments~…using exponential survival functions, the drop in the average retention rate from the 1983 to 1987 span to the 1987 to 1991 span corresponds only to a small change in average job tenure from 6.8 years to 6.3 years without adjustments for business cycles, and the drop is from 6.4 years to 6.2 years with adjustments for business cycles.
166~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~t-year Retention Rates~…for each demographic subgroup, retention rates are shown by current tenure group or age group adjusted for heaping but not business cycles.
166~D1~F6~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Age Group~…for the 16 to 24 age group, the retention rate signficantly fell by 0.043 while the 55+ age group experienced a small and insignificant decline of 0.013.
166~D1~F7~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Tenure Group~…the 4-year retention rates from 1983 to 1987 for the 2 to <9 tenure group is present across all age groups while the rise for the 15+ tenure group is significant only for workers aged 40-54 at a 0.24 increase.
166~D1~F8~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Education Level~…from 1983 to 1987 the estimated 4-retention rates for those workers with at most a high school degree significantly dropped by  0.034  without business cycle adjustments and significantly dropped by 0.022 with business cycle adjustments, while those for college graduates remained the same at 0.000 without business cycle adjustments and signficantly increased by 0.015 with business cycle adjustments, results that parallel changes in the wage structure.
166~D1~F9~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Race~…from 1983 to 1987 the decline in 4-retention rates for blacks is over three times that for whites at 0.067 versus 0.019, declines that are both significant.
166~D1~F10~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Tenure Group for Black Respondents Only~…declines in black 4-retention rates occur across all tenure groups with a notable exception of the 15+ tenure groups, which shows a significant rise of 0.060.
166~D1~F11~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Gender~…from 1983 to 1987, the estimated 4-year retention rates for males decrease by 0.040, while the change for females is neglible.
166~D1~F12~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Tenure Group for Male Respondents Only~…although declines for males occur in all tenure groups, the only significant decline occurs in the 2 to <9 group, with a negative change of 0.08.
166~D1~F13~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Tenure Group for Female Respondents Only~…the retention rate for females in the highest tenure group rose by 0.098, from .634 to .732.
166~D1~F14~Findings~4-year Retention Rate for 2 to <9 Year Tenure Group~…between 1983 and 1987 4-year spans, the most pervasive change occurred in the 2 to <9 year tenure group, of which retention rates declined by 0.061, and all across all demographic subgoroups the decline remained statistically signficant and substantial, ranging from 0.040 for females to 0.104 for blacks.
166~D1~F15~Findings~4-year Retention Rate for Highest and Lowest Tenure Groups~…between 1983 and 1987 4-year spans, many demographic subgroups experienced retention rate increases for the highest tenure workers, including 9 to <15 and 15+ years, as well as the lowest tenure workers, including 0 to <2 years.
166~D1~F16~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Education Level for Youngest Respondents Only~…by education group, the youngest workers with a high school education or less experienced the sharpest decline in the retention rate at 0.062 while the youngest college graduates experienced the sharpest increase at 0.051, both of which are significant.
166~V8~L13~Variable Value~Goods-Producing~…as a wide specification of industry type.
166~V8~L14~Variable Value~Service-Producing~…as a wide specification of industry type.
166~D1~F17~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Industry~…from 1983 to 1987 the overall 4-year retention rate decreased by 0.038 in the goods-producing sector and fell by 0.016 in the service-producing sector.
166~V9~L15~Variable Value~Blue Collar~…as a wide specification of occupation type.
166~V9~L16~Variable Value~White Collar~…as a wide specification of occupation type.
166~D1~F18~Findings~4-year Retention Rate by Occupation~…from 1983 to 1987, the 4-year retention rates for blue-collar workers significantly dropped by 0.064 with the greatest drops occuring in the 2 to <9 and the 9 to <15 tenure groups, while for white-collar/service workers the only significant change occured in the 15+ tenure groups where retention rates rose by 0.069.
166~D1~F19~Findings~10-year Retention Rate~…when reporting changes in 10-year retention rates by tenure group, the 10-year retention rate increased for all but the highest tenure group with the average increase over all workers being 0.018
166~D1~F20~Findings~4-year Retention Rate w/ and w/o Heaping and Business Cycle Adjustments~…the researcher's estimated unadjusted 4-year retention rate for all workers declines by only 0.01 from 0.54 to 0.53, while when corrected for business cycles and heaping the results still show only a modest decline in retention rates from 0.58 to 0.56.
166~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1991, 2.8% of respondents to the tenure supplement did not respond to the tenure question, whereas in 1983 and 1987 there was negligible nonresponse to the tenure questions among those who participated in the supplement.
166~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…used in order to compute a measure of job stability in a subsequent study that the researchers use to compare with estimated results from the Current Population Survey data.
166~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…includes two important questions of interest: one regarding current employment status and the other detecting employer changes among those who are continuously employed.
166~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…from 1970 through 1983, respondents are coded as having no job change if their current job began 12 or more months ago, whereas from 1984 throught 1987, respondents are coded as having no job change if their current job began before the previous calendar year, and lastly from 1988 to 1990, respondents are coded as having no job change if they indicate having another main-job employer only during the previous calendar year.
166~D2~T5~Time Period~1970-1983~…time period in which the Panel Study of Income Dynamics codes individuals as having no job change if their current job began 12 or more months ago.

166~D2~T7~Time Period~1988-1990~…time period in which the Panel Study of Income Dynamics codes individuals as having no job change if they indicate having another main-job employer only in the previous calendar year.
166~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the most direct comparison that researchers can make is for the 1975 to 1977 and the 1981 to 1983 period.
166~D2~T8~Time Period~1975-1977~…time period of interest in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in that it provides the most direct comparison with another relevant time period, 1981 to 1983.
166~D2~T9~Time Period~1981-1983~…time period of interest in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in that it provides the most direct comparison with another relevant time period, 1975 to 1977.
166~D2~V12~Variable~Employer Changes~…the number of times an individual has changed employers in a two year period, most specifically focusing on 1975 to 1977 and 1981 to 1983.
166~V12~L17~Variable Value~Strong Stayers~…those individuals with zero or one employer changes in a two year period. 
166~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~3-year Comparably Aged Strong Stayers~…reseachers compute the proportions for comparably aged respondents with zero or one employer changes in the period 1975 to 1977 and 1981 to 1983.
166~D2~F21~Findings~Comparably Aged Strong Stayers for Initial 3-year Periods~…the comparison between comparably aged strong stayers indicates a decline, from 0.95 to 0.92, in the proportion of strong stayers between 1975 to 1977 and 1981 to 1983.
166~D2~D2~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…data in which overstates job changes to generate a sharper estimated decline in the proportion of strong stayers.
166~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~6-year Comparably Aged Strong Stayers~…researchers report the estimated proportion of strong stayers over the 6-year periods 1975 to 1980 and 1981 to 1986.
166~D2~T10~Time Period~1975-1980~…six year period in which the proportion of comparably aged strong stayers is estimated to generate a sharper estimated decline in the proportion of strong stayers than the 3-year periods.
166~D2~T11~Time Period~1981-1986~…six year period in which the proportion of comparably aged strong stayers is estimated to generate a sharper estimated decline in the proportion of strong stayers than the 3-year periods.
166~D2~F22~Findings~Comparably Aged Strong Stayers for 6-year Periods~…when comparably aged strong stayers are analyzed over the 6-year periods from 0.83 to 0.75, a decline that is nearly three times as large as that for the 3-year periods.

167~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Main Empirical Results~…the main empirical results can be summarized as follows: a convex adjustment costs function is able to account for the data, and performs much better than the prevelant quadratic specification. Restricting the same equations to standard formulations (quadratic, ignoring hiring, or ignoring the investment-hiring interaction) yields poor performance. The estimates imply adjustment costs of reasonable magnituded when compared to known estimates. 
167~D1, D2, D3, D4~F8~Findings~Model Fit Explanation~…the fit of the model and its improvement over the existing literature is due to the use of gross flows for both investment and hiring, the joint consideration of hiring and investment including their interaction, and the sufficient convexity of the adjustment costs function.

168~D1~T1~Time Period~1973-1978~…survey period of interest from which data from the May dual job holding supplement of the Current Population Survey was drawn.
168~D1~T2~Time Period~1979-1992~…survey period of interest from which data from the outgoing rotation group files of the Current Population Survey was drawn.
168~D1~T3~Time Period~1973-1992~…total survey period of interest for which hours-weighted kernel estimates of the density of hourly wages for men and for women are computed and compared.
168~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Federal Minimum Wage~…a vertical line in each wage figure indicates the value of the federal minimum wage in the respective year from 1973 to 1992.
168~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Federal Minimum Wage~…reported verbatim and in real 1979 dollars deflated by the GDP deflator.
168~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Federal Minimum Wage~…the minimum wage rose and fell in erratic steps from 1973 to 1978, and fell in real terms every year from 1979 to 1989.
168~D1~T4~Time Period~1973-1979~…important time period for comparison purposes as during which wage inequality and labor market institutions were more stable.
168~D1~T5~Time Period~1988-1992~…important time period for comparison purposes as during which wage inequality and labor market institutions were more stable.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in contrast with most previous work which has used earnings data from the March Current Population Survey, researchers use hourly wage data from the May Current Population Survey and from the outgoing rotation group supplements of the Current Population Survey.
168~D1~T6~Time Period~1979-1988~…main focus period for comparing the density of wages over time.
168~D1~F1~Findings~Decline in the Real Minimum Wage and Standard Deviation of Log Wages by Gender~…it is found that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage over the relevant period, 1979-1988, had a large visual and quantitative impact on the distribution of wages; indeed, it is found that it explains up to 25% of the change in the standard deviation of men's log wages and up to 30% of the change in the standard deviation of women's log wages.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in order to analyze changes in the distribution of wages in the United States from 1973 to 1992.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…starting in May 1973, the Current Population Survey has regularly collected hourly or weekly earnings for each respondent's main job; from 1973 to 1978, these wage questions were asked only in May, as part of the dual job holding supplement, however, beginning in 1979, the wage questions were asked each month to people in the outgoing rotation grous (which represent one-quarter of all individuals in the survey).
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample sizes are approximately 40,000 workers per year from 1973 to 1978, and 150,000 workers per year from 1979 to 1992.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…one advantage of using these samples is that the wage measure collected is a good mesaure of a point-of-time price of labor.
168~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…a good measure of a point-of-time price of labor.
168~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…the measure used in this paper is closely connected to theories of wage determination based on supply and demand that focus on the hourly price of labor.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a key advantage of the 1973-1973 dual job supplements and of the 1983-1992 outgoing rotation group supplements is that they contain information on the union status of workers.
168~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~…this variable is essential to any attempt to evaluate the effect of labor market institutions on the distribution of wages.
168~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~…was not collected in the outgoing rotation group supplements from 1979 to 1982; it is nevertheless possible to obtain the union status in 1979 for a subset of workers by matching answers about unionization from the 1979 Pension Supplement of the May 1979 Current Population Survey to the corresponding wage data collected in the outgoing rotation group supplements of May, June, July, or August 1979.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…information on the union status of workers was not collected in the outgoing rotation group supplement from 1979 to 1982, however it is is possible to obtain the union status in 1979 for a subset of workers by matching answers about unionization from the 1979 Pension Supplement of the May 1979 Current Population Survey to the corresponding wage data collected in the outgoing rotation group supplements of May, June, July, or August, 1979; this matched 1979 of about 35,000 observations is used whenever the estimation requires using union status for 1979. It is also possible to obtain the union status of workers for the subsample of workers who were in an outgoing rotation group in May 1980, or 1981 since they were asked about their union status in the job holding supplement.
168~D1~T7~Time Period~1979-1982~…survey period from which union status is not available in the outgoing rotation group supplement of the Current Population Survey.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…one issue is that usual weekly earnings are topcoded at $999 from 1973 to 1985, and at $1923 thereafter, and that relatively low value of the top code in real terms is likely to understate wage dispersion in the upper tail of the distribution; to avoid this type of bias, researchers use the upper tail of the 1986 distribution of wages to impute a wage distribution to the observations censored at the top code in other years. This procedure is used only for years in which more than 0.5% of the workforce is topcoded (1981 to 1985 and 1990 to 1992).
168~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Weekly Earnings~…weekly earnings are topcoded at $999 from 1973 to 1985, and at $1923 thereafter.
168~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Weekly Earnings~…researchers use the upper tail of the 1986 distribution of wages to impute a wage distribution to the observations censored at the top code in other years
168~D1~T8~Time Period~1981-1985, 1990-1992~…years in which a weekly earnings imputation procedure is used as more than 0.5% of the workforce is topcoded.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all observations with allocated wages were eliminated from the 1979 to 1988 outgoing rotation group files to keep these samples comparable to the 1979 to 1978 samples.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…only individuals of age 16 to 65 and reporting an hourly wage from $1 to $100 (in 1979 dollars) were kept in the sample. 
168~D1~V2~Variable~GDP Deflator~…the GDP deflator for personal consumption expenditures was used to convert nominal wages into 1979 dollars.
168~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…the relevant sample only includes those reporting an hourly wage from $1 to $100 (in 1979 dollars).
168~D1~V3~Variable~Age~…the relevant sample only includes individuals of age 16 to 65 years.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all the estimates reported in this paper are weighted by the product of the Current Population survey sample weights with usual hours of work; these hours-weighted estimates put more weight on the wages of workers who supply many hours to the labor market, which gives a better representation of the dispersion of wages for each and every hour worked in the labor market, regardless of who is supplying this hour.
168~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Real Hourly Wage~…the hourly wage deflated by the GDP deflator to represent 1979 dollars.
168~D1~V4~Variable~Gender~…in order to differentiate distributions of wages across genders.
168~D1~V5~Variable~Education~…in order to differentiate distributions of wages across levels of education.
168~D1~V6~Variable~Race~…in order to differentiate distributions of wages across race.
168~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Potential Labor Market~…age minus education minus 5.
168~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Potential Labor Market~…follows a U-shaped curve as the baby boom generation first entered the labor market during the 1970's and then aged during the 1980's.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a significant fraction of interviewees in the Current Population Survey fail to answer questions about wages; while the Census Bureau used a hot deck procedure to replace missing wages by an allocated value in the 1979-1992 outgoing rotation group files, it simply coded the wage as missing in the 1973 to 1978 dual job holding supplements.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…note that, because of a coding error in this data source, it is impossible to identify most workers with allocated wages from 1989 to 1992; however, this error is of little consequence for most of the analysis as researchers focus on the 1979 to 1988 period.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…the density estimates reported in this paper are obtained by adapting the kernel density estimator introduced by Rosenblatt (1956) and Parzen (1962) to the case in which sample weights are attached to each observation; the kernal density estimate of a univariate density based on a random sample of a specified size with sample weights is dependent on the bandwidth and the kernel function.
168~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Bandwidth~…used in computing the kernel density estimate of a univariate density based on a random sample of a specified size with sample weights.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…the critical issue in kernel density estimation is the choice of bandwidth.
168~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Bandwidth~…the critical issue in kernel density estimation is the choice of bandwidth.
168~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Bandwidth~…in this paper, we use the plug-in method of Sheather and Jones (1991) as bandwidth selector since it does not exhibit the discretization problems associated with cross-validation methods.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…alll kernel density estimates presented here use the optimal bandwidth calculate with Sheather and Jones' selector.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…the kernel function used is Gaussian while the weights are the Current Population Survey sample weights multiplied by usual hours of work and normalized to sum to one; the optimal bandwidths for these hours-weighted density estimates range from 0.05 to 0.08, depending on the range of the support and the sparsity of the observations.
168~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Bandwidth~…the optimal bandwidths for hours-weighted density estimates range from 0.05 to 0.08, depending on the range of the support and the sparsity of the observations.
168~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Bandwidth~…while the estimated densities become less smooth when the bandwidth becomes small relative to the optimal value, the general shape of the densities remains the same for a large range of bandwidths.
168~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Wage Density~…the researchers' procedure for decomposing changes in the density of wages is a generalization of the familiar Oaxaca decomposition of changes in means.
168~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Wage Density~"…decompositions of these densities are based on simple counterfactual densities such as ""what would the density of wages have been in 1988 if workers' attributes, such as their union status, had remained at their 1979 level"""
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…one methodological contribution of this paper is to show that the estimation of counterfactual densities can be greatly simplified by the judicious choice of a reweighting function.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…used to illustrate the simulate effect of changes in the level of unionization on the 1988 density of real log wages for a subset of men with 12 years of education and 10 to 30 years of experience.
168~V6~L2~Variable Value~12 Years~…a subgroup of individuals that reported 12 years of education.
168~DV3~L3~Variable Value~10-30 Years~…a subgroup of individuals that reported 10 to 30 years of experience.
168~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Density of Unionization Level Changes~…the density corresponding to the counterfactual that the 1988 density can be decomposed into the weighted sum of the densities of unionized and nonunionized workers is obtained by replacing the relative weight of the densities of unionized vs. nonunionized workers fo 1988 (0.35) by that of 1979 (0.47).
168~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Effect of Changing the Unionization Level~…the effect of changing the unionization level is given by the difference between the 1988 density and the counterfactual density.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…in order to better understand the estimation procedure, it is useful to view each individual observation as a vector made up of wage (which is virtually a continuous variable), a vector of individual attributes (some of which are discrete variables), and a data, which will take only two values in the following comparisons; each individual observation belongs to a joint distribution of wages, individual attributes, and dates and the joing distribution of wages and attributes at a particular point in time is the conditional distribution. The distribution may also depend on distributional characteristics such as the minimum wage.
168~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Wage Density~…the density of wages at one point in time can be written as the integral of the density of wages conditional on a set of individual attributes and on a specific data, over the distribution of individual attributes at a separate date and is dependent on the dmain of definition of the individual attributes.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density~…the density that would have prevailed if individual attributes had remained at their 1979 level and workers had been paid according to the wage schedule observed in 1988.
168~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Wage Density~…represents the actual density of wages in 1988.
168~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Effect of Changes in the Distribution of Workers' Attributes~…the difference between the actual 1988 density and the hypothetical density represents the effect of changes in the distribution of worker's attributes.
168~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Individual Attributes~…the set of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis consist of a dummy variable for union status and a vector of other attributes that includes experience, schooling, race, full-time or part-time status, SMSA dummy, 3 occupational categories, and 19 industry categories.
168~D1~V7~Variable~Union Status~…a binary variable specifying for union status included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~V5~Variable~Education~…a variable specifying for education level included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…a variable specifying for the experience level of a respodent included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~V6~Variable~Race~…a binary variable specifying for race included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~V7~Variable~Employment Status~…a binary variable specifying for full-time or part-time status included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~V8~Variable~SMSA~…an SMSA dummy included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~V9~Variable~Occupation~…a variable consisting of 3 occupational categories as included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~V10~Variable~Industry~…a variable consisting of 19 industry categores as included in a vector of individual attributes used in the empirical analysis.
168~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Individual Attributes~…given the focus on labor market institutions, it is useful to account for union status and a vecot of other attributes separately.
168~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Density of Unionization Level Changes~…first, researchers construct the density of wages that would have prevailed if unionization, but no other attribute, had remained at its 1979 level, and then researchers look at what would have happened if both union status and other individual attributes had remained at their 1979 level.
168~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Reweighting Function~…once an estimate of this reweighting function is obtained, it can be used to estimate the counterfactual density by weighted kernel methods.
168~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Density of Unionization Level Changes~…there are two commonly cited reasons why the conditional density of wages may depend on the unionization rate: nonrandom selection and general equilibrium (or spillover) effects, the former problem of which may be handled and the latter of which cannot.
168~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Density of Unionization Level Changes~…estimates the density of wages that would have prevailed if unionization had remained at its 1979 level and workers had been paid according to the union and nonunion wage schedules.
168~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Reweighting Function~…an estimate of the reweighting function of union status and other attributes can be obtained by estimating a probit based conditional probability. 
168~D1~M2~Methodology~Probit~…a standard model for estimating the conditional probability including the cumulative normal distribution and a vector of covariates that acts as a function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Covariate Vector~…a function of other individual attributes, i.e. excluding union status.
168~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Covariate Vector ~…a low order polynomial in a vector of other individual attributes, i.e. excluding union status.
168~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Covariate Vector~…if other individual attributes took on only a limited number of values, the best covariate vector to use would be a full set of dummy variables indicting each possible value of other individual attributes.
168~D1~M2~Methodology~Probit~…in the special case that other individual attributes take on only a limited number of values, the probit model would be equivalent to a cell-by-cell nonparametric model.
168~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Covariate Vector~…this vector actually consists of a gender dummy fully interacted with fifteen dummies for experience-education groups, a quartic in experience, years of education, experience and education interacted, three region dummies, eighteen industry dummies, two occupation dummies, and dummies for race, SMSA, marital status, and part-time status.
168~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Experience-Education-Gender~…actually consists of gender dummy fully interacted with fifteen dummies for experience-education groups included in a covariate function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…a quartic in experience included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V5~Variable~Education~…reported as years of schooling included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Experience, Education~…experience and education interacted included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V11~Variable~Region~…three region dummies included in a covariate vector of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V12~Variable~Industry~…eighteen industry dummy variables included in a vector of covariates of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V9~Variable~Occupation~…two occupation dummies included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V6~Variable~Race~…dummies for race included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V8~Variable~SMSA~…a dummy variable for SMSA included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V12~Variable~Marital Status~…a variable specifying for marital status included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~V7~Variable~Employment Status~…a dummy variable specifying for full- or part-time status as included in a covariate vector function of other individual attributes.
168~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Probability of Being in a Specific Period~…the probability of being in a specific time period, given other individual attributes, can be estimated using the probability dependent on the cumulative normal distribution and a vector of covariates that acts as a function of individual attributes.
168~D1~M2~Methodology~Probit~…can be used to estimate the probability of being in a specific time period, given individual attributes.
168~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Probability of Being in a Specific Period~…given that researchers view the two dates, 1979 and 1988, as the two possible events in the date space, the unconditional probability for 1979 is equal to the weighted number of observations in 1979 divided by the weighted number of observations in both 1979 and 1988; the unconditional probability for 1988 is defined similarly.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…another potential explanation for the increase in wage inequality between 1979 and 1988 is the 27% decline in the real value of the minimum wage; to evalue the impact of this decline, researchers construct a counterfactual density of wages in 1988 obtained by raising the minimum wage back to its 1979 level.
168~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Federal Minimum Wage~…the minimum wage has no spillover effects on the distribution of wages above the minimum wage.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…FIRST ASSUMPTION: for any two values of the minimum wage, the fact that the federal minimum wage has no spillover effects implies that the conditional densities are the same for wages above the highest value of the minimum wage, i.e. the minimum wage in the later period.
168~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Federal Minimum Wage~…increasing the minimum wage should have positive spillover effects on the wage of skilled workers - earning more than the minimum - if these workers were substitutes for minimum wage workers.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…in order to simulate a complete counterfactual density, assumptions about wages below the minimum wage have to be made including the fact that wages observed below the minimum wage are the result of either noncoverage or noncompliance; thus the second assumption regarding this calculation guarantees that, if the minimum wage in 1988 had remained at its 1979 level, then the distribution of 1988 wages belo the 1979 minimum wage would have been similar to that of 1979, after adjusting for differences in the composition of the labor force.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…SECOND ASSUMPTION: the shape of the conditional density of real wages at or below the minimum wage only depends on the real value of the minimum wage; therefore, for two years and two values of the minimum wage, the shape of the conditional density that would prevail at the initial time if the initial minimum wage were raised to the second value is proportional to the shape of the conditional density for wages at or below the highest value of the minimum wage.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…the second assumption implies that, for wages at or below the value of the 1979 minimum wage, the conditional density of wages that would prevail in 1988 if the minimum wage were raised back to its 1979 level is proportional to the conditional density of wages in 1979.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…a variation of the second assumption is that raising the minimum wage back to its 1979 level would not affect the part of the 1988 distribution below the lower 1988 minimum wage; assumption 2 would still hold, however, for wages between the 1988 and the 1979 values of the minimum wage.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…THIRD ASSUMPTION: the minimum wage has no effects on employment probabilities.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density ~…the third assmption is dictated by an emerging consensus that disemployment effects of increases in the minimum wage are relatively small; moreover, allowing for disemployment effects would cause some attrition in the lower tail of the distribution which would magnify the equalizing effect of the minimum wage.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density~…the simple estimator of counterfactual wage density consists of replacing the section of the 1988 density at or below the 1979 minimum wage by the corresponding section of the 1979 density; note that the section imputed from the 1979 density has to be scaled appropriately to make sure that the overall density still integrates to one.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density~….estimated in some specifications for women with 12 years of education or less and with 20 years of experience or less.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density~…researchers construct a 1988 conditional density with the minimum wage at its 1979 value by selecting the part of the 1988 density above the minimum wage in 1979 and the part of the 1979 density at or below the minimum wage in 1979 with an indicator function; in this case, the 1979 density is premultiplied by a reweighting function to make sure the overall density integrates to one.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density~…to obtain the effect of the minimum wage on the overall distribution of wages in 1988, it is necessary to integrate the condtional density over the distribution of attributes.
168~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Probability of Being in a Specific Period~…the probability of being at a certain data given certain individual attributes and a wage below the 1979 minimum wage, can be estimated using a probit model.
168~D1~M2~Methodology~Probit~…used to estimate the probability of being at a certain date, given certain individual attributes and a wage below the 1979 minimum wage.
168~D1~M2~Methodology~Probit~…in practice, this probit model is estimated pooling observations from the 1979 and 1988 samples that have real wages smaller or equal to the 1979 real minimum wage.
168~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Supply~…a standard measure of supply is useful for understanding wage dispersion between skill categories of workers, but is not well suited for understanding residual wage dispersion within these categories.
168~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Demand~…a standard measure of demand is useful for understanding wage dispersion between skill categories of workers, but is not well suited for understanding residual wage dispersion within these categories.
168~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Supply~…researchers incorporate standard measures of supply and demand into the framework because they wish to compare findings on the relative importance of institutional factors with the rest of the literature that has focused heavily on supply and demand, and they also want to ensure that they are not overstating the importance of institutional factors by ignoring supply and demand considerations.
168~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Demand~…researchers incorporate standard measures of supply and demand into the framework because they wish to compare findings on the relative importance of institutional factors with the rest of the literature that has focused heavily on supply and demand, and they also want to ensure that they are not overstating the importance of institutional factors by ignoring supply and demand considerations.
168~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Supply~…researchers divide the workforce into 32 experience-education-gender cells and construct measures of supply for each cell.
168~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Demand~…researchers divide the workforce into 32 experience-education-gender cells and construct measures of demand for each cell.
168~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Experience-Education-Gender~…researchers divide the workforce into 32 experience-education gender cells in order to construct measures of supply and demand for each cell.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…under the assumption that the production function in each industry is constant elasticity of substitution, linear regression methods can be used to estimtae the shift in the mean cell wage due to changes in supply and demand.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…this regression is estimated in second differences (1979 to 1988 change minus 1973 to 1979 change) to eliminate cell-specific linear trends due, for example, to technological change.
168~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Supply~…this variable is defined as the share of the total workforce in a specific experience-education-gender cell.
168~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Demand~…this demand variable is a fixed-coefficient manpower requirements index that reflects between-sector shifts in relative labor demands.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…in the estimation, researchers use the log $3.00 instead of the minimum wage of $2.90 as the value of the minimum wage in 1979 dollars; this choice is driven by the abnormal concentration of workers at $3.00 in 1979 which suggests either small spillover effects of the minimum wage or misreporting.
168~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Supply Conditions~…a vector of the natural log of distributional characteristics.
168~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Demand Conditions~…a vector of the natural log of distributional characteristics.
168~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Wage Density~…expanding the list of distributional characteristics to include supply and demand conditions, the conditional density of wages becomes defined as the wage density that would have prevailed if supply and demand conditions had remained at their 1979 level.
168~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Overall Effect of Supply and Demand Shocks~…the overall effect of supply and demand shocks is the difference between the 1988 density of wages and the hypothetical density obtained by integrating the conditional densituy of wages that would have prevailed if supply and demand conditions had remained at their 1979 level over the distribution of individual attributes, including union status.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…the five componenets of the final adaption of this equation, with the omission of the distributional factors of supply and demand in 1988, represent the effect of the minimum wage, unionization, other attributes, supply and demand, and residual factors, respectively.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…the decomposition in the final adaption of this equation is sequential to ensure that the change in densities between 1979 and 1988 is exactly equal to the sum of the components corresponding to the factors analyzed; one drawback of sequential decomposition is that the effect of a given factor generally depends on the order of the decomposition, and thus, decomposition will be considered in reverse order to ensure that the results do not overstate the impact of labor market institutions, i.e. the minimum wage and unions, by considering them first.
168~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Reweighting Function~…the product of reweighting functions is obtained by sequentially applying the reweighting function associated with the minimum wage, the function associated with unionization, and that of other attributes.
168~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Alternative Reweighting Function~…note that the reweighting function associated with changes in the minimum wage is replaced by an alternative function when supply and demand factors are also taken into account; this alternative weighting scheme is used since only workers whose 1988 wage would have been below the 1979 minimum wage, if supply and demand conditions had remaind at their 1979 level, should be affected by switching the minimum wage back to its 1979 level.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…to perform the sequential decomposition in reverse order, different weighting functions are used since the effect of other individual attributes is considered before the effect of unions.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…researchers plot the weighted kernel estimates of the counterfactual densities for men and women with superimposed actual densities, and for each explanatory factor, report the density obtained by holding the factor at its 1988 value with a solid line and the density obtained by holding the factor at its 1979 value with adotted line; the difference between the two lines represents the effect of changes in the explanatory factor on the density of wages.
168~D1~F2~Findings~Weighted Kernel Estimates of Counterfactual Densities~…when weighted kernel estimate of the counterfactual densities in decomposition for men and women are plotted, there influence of the minimum wage on the distribution of wages is clearly seen as there is more mass at the bottom of the wage distribution in 1988 (at and slightly above two dollars (1979 dollars)) than if the minimum wage had remained at its 1979 level; this is true for both men and women.
168~D1~F3~Findings~Estimated Densities w/ Unionization Rate Effect~…when the estimated desnities with the unionization rate at its 1979 and 1988 level for men and women are plotted, it is found that changes in unionization had a substantial effect on the distribution of men's wages; the decline in unionization between 1979 and 1988 contributed to the decline of the middle of the dsistribution and the fattening of the lower tail of the distribution.
168~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Changes in Densities~…a clear illustation of contribution of the different explanatory factors is obtained by looking at the changes in densities that cannot be explained after accounting for the effect of each specific factor.
168~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Changes in Densities~…these changes in densities are obtained by plotting the difference between each counterfactual density and the 1979 density.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…when changes in densities are viewed as the difference between each counterfactual density and the 1979 density after accounting for each specific factor, the goal of the decomposition exercise is to get a flat line once all the factors have been accounted for.
168~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Changes in Densities~…looking explicitly at the difference between two densities provides a complete description of changes in the distribution of wages.
168~D1~Dv23~Derived Variable~Changes in Densities~…smoothed using a Gaussian kernel and a bandwidth of 0.07.
168~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Bandwidth~…equal to 0.07 when smoothing the differences in densities.
168~D1~F4~Findings~Cause of Density Changes for Women~…when changes in densities are analyzed, the single, most important cause of changes in the distribution of women's wages is found to be the decline in the minimum wage.
168~D1~F5~Findings~Cause of Density Changes for Men~…in the case of men, the 39% decrease in the unionization rate played a significant role in explaining the clear collapse of the middle of the distribution of wages, a change that is easily explained by the fact that relatively unskilled workers benefit the most from unionization which moves them toward the middle of the wage distribution and as unionization declines, these workers slide back toward the lower tail of the distribution.
168~D1~F6~Findings~Unionization and Women's Wage Distribution~…changes in unionization had a negligible effect on the distribution of women's wages, a result that is consistent with the fact that the unionization rate did not decline very much for women and that unions generally have little impact on women's wage inequality.
168~D1~DV24~Derived Variable~x-y Wage Differential~…the differential of the density of wages at one percentile point minus the differential of the density of wages at another percentile point.
168~DV24~L4~Variable Value~10-90 Wage Differential~…this differential is simply the 90th percentile of the estimated density of wages for 1988 minus the 10th percentile of the estimated density of wages for 1988; the 1979-1988 change in the 10-90 wage differential is obtained by computing similar statistics from the estimated ensity for 1979.
168~D1~DV25~Derived Variable~Theil's Entropy Coefficient~…the negative of the expectation of the logarithm of the 1988 density, dependent on the real wage and the density of its distribution.
168~D1~DV25~Derived Variable~Theil's Entropy Coefficient~…an easily derived inequality measure.
168~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Lorenz Curve~…the locus of points with the cumulative population share on the abscissa and the cumulative wage share, which is the first moment distribution.
168~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Gini Coefficient~…the ratio of the area enlosed by the Lorenz curve and the diagonal line to the total area below the diagonal.
168~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Gini Coefficient~…an easily derived inequality measure.
168~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Gini Coefficient~…this coefficient takes on a minimum value of zero (perfect equality) when the Lorenz curve coincides with the diagonal, and a maximum value of one (perfect inequality).
168~D1~DV25~Derived Variable~Theil's Entropy Coefficient~…one drawback of this summary measure is that it provides little information on the different shapes of two distributions.
168~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Gini Coefficient~…one drawback of this summary measure is that it provides little information on the different shapes of two distributions.
168~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Distance~…given that the focus of this paper is on what happens wehere in the distribution, it is useful to provide a measure of the divergence between the distributions that relates more directly to estimates of density differences.
168~D1~DV28~Derived variable~Distance~…a statistical measure of distance or divergence used between two densities; originally considered by Kullback and Leibler (1951).
168~D1~F7~Findings~Minimum Wage and x-y Differentials~…the minimum wage explains 25% of the change in the 10-90 differential, 66% of the change in the 10-50 diffferential, and 49% of the change in the 5-95 differential.
168~D1~F8~Findings~Overall Minimum Wage Standard Deviation Explanation~…the minimum wage explains very little of the change in the 50-90 or the 25-75 differential; however, overall, the minimum wage explains 25% of the change in the standard deviation of the log of wages.
168~D1~F9~Findings~Unions and Standard Deviation of Log Wages~…the visually apparent contribution of unions to the declining middle or the distribution of men's wages translates into a 14% change in the standard deviation of log wages.
168~D1~F10~Findings~Distribution of Individual Attributes and Standard Deviation of Log Wages~…changes in the distribution of individual attributes explains about 14% of the change in the standard deviation.
168~D1~F11~Findings~Supply and Demand and Standard Deviation of Log Wages and x-y Wage Differentials~…supply and demand effects explain between 20% and 30% of changes in the standard deviation and in the 10-90 and 25-75 wage differentials.
168~D1~F12~Findings~Theil's and Gini Coefficient~…changes in individual attributes explain the greatest proportion of the change in Theil's coefficient over the period at 62%, while on the other hand, the most important factor in explaining changes in the Gini coefficient is changes in supply and demand which account for 27% of the total; these differences reflect the fact that the Gini coefficient puts relatively more weight on the middle of the distribution while Theil's coefficient emphasizes the tails.
168~D1~F13~Findings~Minimum Wage and Standard Deviation of Log Wages by Gender~…the effect of changes in the minimum wage on changes in the standard deviation of log wages is larger for women, at 30%, than for men, at 25%. 
168~D1~F14~Findings~Minimum Wage and Divergence~…for both men and women, changes in the minimum wage explain over half of the divergence between the 1979 and 1988 distributions with a coefficient of 0.180.
168~D1~F15~Findings~Kullback-Leiber Measure by Gender~…the changes in densities unexplained by the four factors considered amount to 22% of the Kullback-Leibler measure for men, and to 5% for women.
168~D1~M3~Methodology~Log Wage~…to adress the issue that institutional factors might be the leading explanation for changes in wage dipersion within skill group, researchers follow Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) and estimate standard wage regressions to decompose wage dispersion between aand within skill groups.
168~D1~M3~Methodology~Log Wage~…the variables included in the log wage regressions consist of 32 gender-experience education dummies fully interacted with experience, experience squared, years of education, a marital status dummy, and a race dummy.
168~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Experience-Education-Gender~...32 gender-experience-education dummies included in log wage regressions and interacted fully with experience, experience squared, years of education, a marital status dummy, and a race dummy.
168~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…included in log wage regressions and interacted fully with 32 gender-experience-education dummies.
168~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Experience Squared~…included in log wage regressions and interacted fully with 32 gender-experience-education dummies.
168~D1~V5~Variable~Education~…years of schooling included in log wage regressions and interacted fully with 32 gender-experience-education dummies.
168~D1~V12~Variable~Marital Status~…included in log wage regressions and interacted fully with 32 gender-experience-education dummies.
168~D1~V6~Variable~Race~…included in log wage regressions and interacted fully with 32 gender-experience-education dummies.
168~D1~M3~Methodology~Log Wage~…predicted wages from these regressions are used to compute between measures of wage dispersion while residuals are used to compute within measures.
168~D1~M3~Methodology~Log Wage~…used to report estimates of the between- and within-standard deviation for each of the reweighted samples used in the main decomposition; one advantage of decomposing the variance into a between and a within component is that these two components aggregate up to the total variance.
168~D1~F16~Findings~Within Component Effect by Gender~…it is found that the within component accounts for 43% of the increase in the variance of wages.
168~D1~F17~Findings~Supply and Demand Changes in the Standard Deviation of Log Wages and Within-Group Standard Deviation~…changes in supply and demand factors are the most important explanations for the change in the standard deviation of wages between skill groups and play a negligible role in changes in the within-group standard deviation.
168~D1~F18~Findings~Institutions and Within-Group Standard Deviation~…institutions explain a significant share (more than 30%) of the change in the within-group standard deviation.
168~D1~F19~Findings~Minimum Wage Effect on the Standard Deviation of Men's Wages w/ and w/o Part-Time Workers~…the estimated effect of the minimum wage on the standard deviation of men's wages falls from 0.018 to 0.013 when part-time workers are excluded from the log wage regressions.
168~D1~F20~Findings~Minimum Wage and College/High School Premium for 20-29 Years of Experience~…the minimum wage played no role in the 0.141 increase in the college/high school premium for men with 20 to 29 years of experience.
168~D1~F21~Findings~Minimum Wage and College/High School Premium for 0-9 Years of Experience~…for young men with 0 to 9 years of experience, the minimum wage only explains 10% of the striking 0.228 increase in the college/high school premium.
168~D1~F22~Findings~Minimum Wage Differentials for Black Females and Youth~…the magnitude of the estimated effect of the minimum wage on changes in high school/dropout differentials for young men is 0.06 and for black women is 0.04, suggesting that the minimum wage has a sizable effect on differentials involving the lowest paid groups of workers (black female or youth who have not completed high school); this effect helps explain why, for men, the minimum wage has an important effect on changes in measures that put more weight on the tails than on the middle of the distribution, like the variance of log wages or Theil's coefficient.
168~D1~M1~Methodology~Second-Difference~…researchers repeat the second-difference analysis in reverse order by performing the sequential analysis beginning with the effect of changes in supply and demand, followed by the effect of individual attributes other than unionization, then by unionization, and with minimum wage effects last; reversing the order of the decomposition unambiguously increases the effect of supply and demand factors and diminishes the role of changes in the minimum wage.
168~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Individual Attributes~…the individual attributes are experience, experience squared, education, SMSA, marital status, full-time or part-time, 3 occupational and 19 industry classes.
168~D1~F23~Findings~Reversed Decomposition and  Unionization Impact on the Standard Deviation of Log Wages for Men~…for men, the impact of changes in unionization on the standard deviation of log wages increases from 14.3% to 21% of the total change when the order of the decomposition is reversed.
168~D1~F24~Findings~Reversed Decomposition and Labor Market Institution Effect on the Total Change in the Standard Deviation of Log Wages~…the total affect of labor market institutions, is approximately 38% of the total change in the standard deviation, is thus relatively robust to changes in the order of the decomposition.
168~D1~T4~Time Period~1973-1979~…over this time period, both the real value of the minimum wage and coverage rose substantially; the unionization rate also increased, but slightly, for both men and women because of the growth in public sector unionization.
168~D1~M3~Methodology~Log Wage~…in later specifications of this model, researchers decompose the changes in the standard deviation of log wages for the period 1973 to 1979, as well as for 1988 to 1992.
168~D1~F25~Findings~Minimum Wages, Standard Deviation of Log Wages, and Unionization for Men~…for men, minimum wage changes explain 35% of the decline in the standard deviation of log wages for the 1973 to 1979 period, while unions explain 26%, supporting the prediction that labor market institutions should have opposite effects over the 1973 to 1979 and the 1979 to 1988 periods. The effect of changes in the level of unionization is entirely due to the growth of public sector unionization over this period, which went from 23% to 38%; private sector unionization declined from 24% to 22% over this period and would have caused a slight increase of 0.0003 in the standard deviation of log wages for men.
168~D1~F26~Findings~Minimum Wages, Standard Deviation of Log Wages, and Unionization for Women~…for women, changes in the minimum wage explain 29% of the decline in the standard deviation of log wages, while changes in the unionization rate have virtually no effect, supporting the prediction that labor market institutions should have opposite effects over the 1973 to 1979 and the 1979 to 1988 period.
168~D1~M3~Methodology~Log Wage~…in later specifications of this model, researchers decompose the standard deviation of log wages into a between- and a within-group component.
168~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…one important feature of the May/outgoing rotation group Current Population Survey data is that the within-group standard deviation of log wages decreased between 1973 and 1979; this is at odds with analyses based on March Current Population Survey data which concluded that wage dispersion within skill groups increased during the 1970's.
168~D1~T5~Time Period~1988-1992~…by 1988, many states had legislated minimum wage increases above the federal minimum; when appropriate, these state minimum wages to compute the effect of changes in the minimum wage on changes in the distribution of wages between 1988 and 1992.
169~169: Labor Reallocation over the Business Cycle: New Evidence from Internal Migration~~~~
169~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this research examines gross migration patterns during the entire postwar era using historical reports of the Current Population Survey.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…the analysis of this researcher is supplemented with statistics compiled by the Internal Revenue Service on inter-state and inter-metropolitan population flows since 1975.
169~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Long-Distance Migration~…long-distance migration is defined as a move across state, metropolitan area, or country boundaries.
169~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Long-Distance Migration~…because long-distance migration is frequently accompanied by a new employer-employee match or a change in labor force status, the cyclicality of geogrpahic churning may help to shed light on the cyclicality of worker reallocation more generally.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…among household heads in the PSID who move across state lines from 1968 to 1993, 28% changed employment status and 34% changed employers, compared with 15% and 12%, respectively, for heads who did not change states.
169~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Migration and Business Cycle Correlation~…researchers carefully distinguish two potential sources of correlation between migration rates and the aggregate business cycle. The first source of correlation between migration rates and the business cycle would result from systematic changes in the dispersion of relative local labor demand over the course of the business cycle. The second source of correlation between migration rates and the business cycle is correlation with national economic conditions. This correlation is the parameter of interest because cyclical variation in national economic conditions may change the net cost of moving, altering the location choices of individuals even when opportunities for relative wage or employment gains across local markets are unchanged.
169~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Net Cost of Moving~…these costs are related to a number of factors including cyclical variation in the productivity of a worker-firm match, the cost of job search, or adjustment costs in the housing market, and distinguishing between these factors can shed light on the determinants of other types of worker reallocation.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…national economic conditions are defined as shocks common to all locations within the United States.
169~D1, D4, D7~F1~Findings~Migration and the Business Cycle~…researchers find that migration is strongly procyclical, even after accounting for relative variation in local economic conditions over the cycle. These results suggest that the net cost of moving changes systematically over the business cycle.
169~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…the nature of migration costs is explored in more detail by examining the characteristics of individuals for whom migration is most procyclical.
169~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Migration Across Demographic Groups~…the procyclicality of migration does not differ significantly across most major demographic groups, with the notable exception of younger workers who are markedly more procyclical. In particular, education, employment stuats, and homeownership are uncorrelated with cyclical fluctuations in the probability of having moved in the past year.
169~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Long-Distance Migration~…migration is a means for workers to arbitrage the total cost and benefit of residence in different locations.
169~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~Migration Decision~…consider an individual who lives in location J but is considering a move to location K. In the traditional migration model, this individual weights the present value of the benefit to moving from J to K against the costs, moving only if the net benefit is positive.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…the net benefit to a specific individual from moving to K from J at any time t.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…the net benefits of moving are a function of all factors that influence the benefits and costs from migration.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…dependent on time-varying benefits and cost, factor-dependent costs, costs and benefits that do not depend on an individual's origin and destination locations, time-varying personal characteristics, and amenities differentials across locations.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Benefits~…time-varying benefits associated with moveing between the specific markets J and K as included in computing the net benefit of moving.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Costs~…time-varying costs associated with moveing between the specific markets J and K as included in computing the net benefit of moving.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Benefits~…these may include benefits that depend either on the destination-origin pair or on the destination or origin only.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Costs~…these may include costs that depend either on the destination-origin pair or on the destination or origin only.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Benefits~…examples of time-varying benefits include the component of earnings, employment opportunities, and housing costs arising from local economic conditions.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Costs~…examples of time-varying costs include the component of earnings, employment opportunities, and housing costs arising from local economic conditions.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Benefits~…time-varying benefits that are specific to the location pair might arise if there is a history of migration between two locations, giving migrants from one labor market an advantage in securing jobs in another market.
169~D1, D3, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Costs~…time-varying costs that are specific to the location pair might arise if there is a history of migration between two locations, giving migrants from one labor market an advantage in securing jobs in another market.
169~D1, D3, D4, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Factor-Dependent Costs~…costs that depend on features of J and K but do not vary over time, and would primarily include distance-related costs like truck rental and the time and labor costs of moving.
169~D1, D6~V2~Variable~Benefit~…represents benefits that do not depend on an individual's origin and destination locations.
169~D1, D6~V3~Variable~Costs~…represents costs that do not depend on an individual's origin and destination locations.
169~D1, D6~V4~Variable~Constant Costs~…represents costs that do not depend on an individual's origin and destination locations.
169~D1, D6~V4~Variable~Constant Costs~…these costs are similar for all movers at all times; these include organizational costs like discontinuing and establishing new relationships with service providers.
169~D1, D6~V2~Variable~Benefit~…these benefits are similar for all movers only at a point in time and may be influenced by the business cycle.
169~D1, D6~V3~Variable~Costs~…these costs are similar for all movers only at a point in time and may be influenced by the business cycle. For example the costs of searching for a new job in any location may vary over the cycle, particularly if swings in job creation are an important component of the cycle or if firm restructuring is procyclical. 
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~...If the costs of searching for a new home or selling an existing home vary over the cycle, this will affect the net benefits to moving at a point in time.
169~D1, D6~V2~Variable~Benefit~…aggregate fluctuations in wages and employment will alter the costs and benefits of moving through changes in the cost of leaving or taking a current or new job.
169~D1, D6~V3~Variable~Costs~…aggregate fluctuations in wages and employment will alter the costs and benefits of moving through changes in the cost of leaving or taking a current or new job.
169~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…time-varying personal characteristics as included in computing the net benefits to migration between J and K.
169~D4, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Amenities Differentials~…amenities differentials across locations as included in computing the net benefits to migration between J and K.
169~D4, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Amenities Differentials~…this computation is represented by an average over a vector of differentials with individual-specific weights.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…the fact that a number of costs and benefits to migration (like person-specific amenity benefits) are time invariant suggests that cyclical migration will not provide a complete picture of migration determinants.
169~D4, D6~DV2~Derived Variable~Net Cost of Moving~…the fact that a number of costs and benefits to migration (like person-specific amenity benefits) are time invariant suggests that cyclical migration will not provide a complete picture of migration determinants.
169~D4, D6~DV2~Derived Variable~Net Cost of Moving~…in an economic environment with heterogeneous workers and locations, the existence of migration costs means that, at any given time, there are individuals who would find it desirable to live in a different location if migration were less costly.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…in equilibrium, this value is equal to zero because in an economic environment with heterogeneous workers and locations, the existence of migration costs means that, at any given time, there are individuals who would find it desirable to live in a different location if migration were less costly.
169~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~Migration Decision~…equalization of utility across locations guarantees that in equilibrium there is a group of individuals on the margin of moving and not.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…equalization of utility across locations guarantees that in equilibrium there is a group of individuals on the margin of moving and not. These individuals will have a net benefit equal to 0 or very close, i.e. 0 minus the error term. In this case, small changes in any of the time-varying factors could push the net benefit in the next time period to be above zero.
169~D4, D6~DV5~Derived Variable~Net Benefit of Moving~…fluctuations in the time-varying economy-wide costs and benefits could lead to changes in the geographic distribution of the population even when local amenity, labor market, and housing market differentials remain the same.
169~D4, D6~DV2~Derived Variable~Net Cost of Moving~…fluctuations in the time-varying economy-wide costs and benefits could lead to changes in the geographic distribution of the population even when local amenity, labor market, and housing market differentials remain the same.
169~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…increases in the migration rate is dependent on an increase in the net benefit of moving and the inverse of the size of the population.
169~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Population Size~…the size of the sample population as used in determining relative increases in the migration rate.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in order to observe migration over the largest possible number of business cycles, researchers construct a time series on aggregate migration in the United States based on the Current Population Survey.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to the knowledge of the authors, this survey provides the longest nationally-representative data on migration rates in the United States.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…measurement of business cycle conditions is complicated because no single variable in the relvant data sets best reflect these fluctuations. Therefore, researchers use a variety of measures of the national business cycle.
169~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…these rates are calcualted as the number of individuals age 14 and up who moved between states or counties during the previous 12 months relative to the total population of the same age group.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…from 1948 to 1976, the data are taken from historical Current Population Survey reports published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For 1980 onwards, researchers tabulate the fraction of migrations from Current Population Survey microdata. The years 1972-75, 1977-79, 1990 and 1995 are missing because in those years the Current Population Survey did not ask respondents where they were living in the previous year.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all data are from the March Current Population Survey, so the migration rates reflect geographic reallocation from April of the preceding year to March of the current year.
169~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…all data are from the March Current Population Survey, so the migration rates reflect geographic reallocation from April of the preceding year to March of the current year.
169~D1~T1~Time Period~1948-1976~…survey period from which data are taken from historical Current Population Survey reports published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
169~D1~T2~Time Period~1980-2004~…survey period from which the fraction of migrants are tabulated from Current Population Survey microdata.
169~D1~T3~Time Period~1972-1975, 1977-1979, 1990, 1995~…these surveyyears are missing because in those years the Current Population Survey did not ask respondents where they were living in the previous year.
169~DV10~L1~Variable Value~Inter-State Rates~…a count of only inter-state moves will understate the degree of geographic churning that may occur in large states with multiple metropolitan areas.
169~DV10~L2~Variable Value~Inter-County Rates~…some inter-county movers remain in the same local labor and housing market, which means that this measure will overstate intermetropolitan migration.
169~DV10~L1~Variable Value~Inter-State Rates~…some inter-state movers remain in the same local labor and housing market, which means that this measure will overstate intermetropolitan migration.
169~DV10~L2~Variable Value~Inter-County Rates~…this measure has the advantage in that it covers the entire geographic area of the United States.
169~DV10~L1~Variable Value~Inter-State Rates~…this measure has the advantage in that it covers the entire geographic area of the United States.
169~DV10~L3~Variable Value~Inter-MSA Rates~…inter-MSA migration rates will not account for migration between metropolitan and rural areas.
169~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…in this paper, researchers will examine inter-state, inter-metropolitan area and inter-county flows, depending on data availability.
169~D4~V6~Variable~Recession Periods~…recession periods are defined as done by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
169~D1, D2, D4~F3~Findings~Migration and Recessionary Periods~…figures strongly suggest that migration declines during a recession, whether it is measured as all inter-county moves or only state-to-state relocation. With the exception of the recessions in 1957 and 1960, inter-state migration is lower at the end of the recession that it was prior to when the recession began. Although it is difficult to assess the timing more precisely without monthly migration data, it appears that migration is lowest near the end of a recession or during the year after a trough has been reached.
169~D4~D4~Dataset~National Bureau of Economic Research~…used to define recession period. The NBER's designation is the most widely-used measure of recession, but it does not reflect the amplitude of fluctuations in national economic activity.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…because the NBER's designation does not reflect the amplitude of fluctuations in national economic activity, researchers calculate three different measures of the magnitude of the business cycle, which researchers will rely on throughout empirical analysis
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…because the Current Population Survey microdata are a subsample fo the entire survey, the count of the nubmer of migrants does not match the published totals exactly. However, for the years that can be compared, the difference between the published totals and the calculated tabulations are relatively minor. To avoid breaks in the time series shown in the figure, researchers add the average difference from 1970 to 1976 to the migration rates based on the microdata.
169~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…because the Current Population Survey microdata are a subsample fo the entire survey, the count of the number of migrants does not match the published totals exactly. However, for the years that can be compared, the difference between the published totals and the calculated tabulations are relatively minor. To avoid breaks in the time series shown in the figure, researchers add the average difference from 1970 to 1976 to the migration rates based on the microdata.
169~D1~T4~Time Period~1970-1976~…survey period from which researchers add the average difference from 1970 to 1976 to the migration rates based on Current Population Survey microdata.
169~DV10~L3~Variable Value~Inter-MSA Rates~…for more recent periods, researchers can assess the potential bias from these approximations by computing the share of inter-county and inter-state migrants who moved between MSAs.
169~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~County Change vs. MSA Change~…Current Population Survey microdata from 1980 and 1985 reveal that rougly 75% of people who changed counties within a state also changed MSAs.
169~DV11~L4~Variable Value~Employment Gap~…the first measure of the business cycle is the employment gap, which is defined as the logarithm of aggregate employment relative to its trend, where this trend is estimated from a Hodrick-Prescott filter.
169~DV11~L4~Variable Value~Employment Gap~…to be consistent with the timing of the migration data, researchers define the annual employment gap as the average monthly gap from April of the previous year to March of the current year.
169~DV11~L5~Variable Value~National Unemployment Rate~…the second variable reserachers use to measure the business cycle is the national unemployment rate, which has been used to measure business cycles in a number of prior studies such as Barsky et al. (1989) and Solon et al. (1994)
169~DV11~L5~Variable Value~National Unemployment Rate~…to be consistent with the timing of the Current Population Survey, researchers calculate the unemployment rate for each year as the average from April in the previous year to March in the current year.
169~DV11~L5~Variable Value~National Unemployment Rate~"…one disadvantage of the unemployment rate is that state-level data are only available starting in the mid-1970s, making it difficult to decompose the national cycle into contributions from aggregate and reallocation shocks for the entire Current Population Survey sample period. Therefore, reserachers also calculate the ""UI claims rate""."
169~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~UI Claims rate~…defined as the number of unemployment insurance claimants relative to total covered employment.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the unemployment insurance data are only available as annual averages prior to 1971.
169~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~UI Claims rate~…the unemployment insurance data are only available as annual averages prior to 1971, so researchers associate the number of migrants in March of year t with the average claims rate in year t-1.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…regresses the employment gap against the share of individuals age 14 and up who moved between counties in the previous year, where the migration rate has been detrended using an HP filter.
169~D1, D2, D4~F5~Findings~Ordinary Least-Squares Regression Slope~…the slope of the regression line between the employment gap and the share of individuals age 14 and up who moved between countries in the previous year is 0.06, which implies that the national employment falls 4% relative to trend (a drop corresponding to two standard deviations), migration declines by about 0.24 percentage points. Compared with an average migration rate of about 6.1% over the sample period and a standard deviation of 0.24%, this change in migration is small but not inconsequential.
169~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~UI Claims rate~…the number of unemployment insurance claimants is the number of people receiving a UI check for the first time in that calendar year. Someone who received three months of UI checks for June through August of 1980 would be counted as one claimant in 1980. Someone who received checks for December through February, overlapping 1980 and 1981, would be counted as one claimant in both 1980 and 1981.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers estimate correlations between the employment gap and the share of individuals age 14 and up who moved between countries in the previous year for men in separate age groups and by redefining migration as inter-state relocation. The sample is limited to men because researchers did not collect the data by age group for females from the historical Current Population Survey reports. However, the coefficients on the business cycle measures are largely unchanged when the 14 and up sample is limited to men, suggesting minimal gender differences in the cyclicality of migration.
169~D1, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…fluctuations in migration can be caused by either aggregate shocks to the net benefit of moving or by changes in the dispersion of relative local conditions.
169~D2, D4, D5~DV13~Derived Variable~State Employment Gap Estimates~…researchers show a kernel density estimate of the distribution of state employment gaps for all the years in which the national employment gap was in the top quartile of its 1948-2004 range, compared to a kernel density estimate in years when the national employment gap was in its bottom quartile.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the age-based analysis sample is limited to men because researchers did not collect the data by age group for females from the historical Current Population Survey reports. However, the coefficients on the business cycle measures are largely unchanged when the 14 and up sample is limited to men, suggesting minimal gender differences in the cyclicality of migration.
169~D4, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~State-Level Employment Gaps~…the state-level employment gaps are defined as the log of state employment relative to its HP trend.
169~D4~V7~Variable~State-Level Unemployment Rates~…state-level estimates of the unemployment rate are only available beginning in 1976.
169~D2, D4, D5~DV13~Derived Variable~State Employment Gap Estimates~…state-level estimates of the unemployment rate are only available beginning in 1976, so these figures use the top and bottom quartile of national unemployment rates over the period 1975 to 2004.
169~D2, D4, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Dispersion of State Level Conditions~…measures of the dispersion of state level conditions in the simple time-series regressions.
169~D2, D4, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Dispersion of State Level Conditions~…whether dispersion is measured as the standard deviation across states, the difference between the 90th and 10th percentiles, or the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles, controlling for dispersion does not qualitatively alter the procyclical correlation of migration with the national employment gap.
169~D4~V7~Variable~State-Level Unemployment Rates~…controlling for variation in state unemployment rates strengthens the procyclical relationship of migration with the national unemployment rate.
169~D2, D4, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Dispersion of State Level Conditions~…these measures of dispersion are not significantly related to migration.
169~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~UI Claims rate~…differences in state UI claims rates appear to be unrelated to migration patterns, but, in the case of this research, including these measures makes the procyclical correlation between migration and national conditions more imprecise.
169~D2, D4, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Dispersion of State Level Conditions~…large states that encompass multiple labor market areas may not accurately reflect the economic conditions considered by households when making their migration decisions.
169~D5~DV16~Derived Variable~Dispersion in MSA Level conditions~…researchers measure local conditions as the employment gap, relative income per capita, or relative house prices. Although ontrolling for these conditions shortens the sample period in some specifications, in no case does controlling for dispersion in these conditions change the procyclical correlation between migration and the national employment gap.
169~D5~V8~Variable~MSA Employment Gap~…one measure of local conditions is the employment gap in the metropolitan area of interest.
169~D5~DV21~Derived Variable~Relative Income Per Capita~…one measure of local conditions is the relative income per capita in the metropolitan area of interest.
169~D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Relative House Prices~…one measure of local conditions is the house prices in the metropolitan area of interest.
169~D5~D5~Dataset~Regional Economic Information System~…this data source, available from 1969 onward, provides local condition measures including the employment gap and relative income per capita.
169~D5~T5~Time Period~1969-2004~…relevant survey period from which the BEA's Regional Economic Information System data is available.
169~D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Relative House Prices~…this measure is equal to the OFHEO house price index multiplied by median house values in 2005.
169~D6~V10~Variable~OFHEO House Price Index~…the OFHEO house price index multiplied by median house values in 2005 is equal to relative house prices.
169~D6~V11~Variable~Median House Values~…the OFHEO house price index multiplied by median house values in 2005 is equal to relative house prices.
169~D6~D6~Dataset~American Community Survey~…this data source provides the OFHEO house price index and the median house values in 2005.
169~D6~D6~Dataset~American Community Survey~…this data is limited to 122 metropolitan areas with house price indexes available since 1980.
169~D6~T6~Time Period~2005.0~…relevant year for which median house values are computed in.
169~D6~T11~Time Period~1980-2004~…relevant survey period from which American Community Survey data on the OFHEO house price index is available.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey provides a national time series on internal migration that spans the largest possible number of business cycles in the postwar United States. However, national data may obscure features of local labor market dynamics that may be important for explaining cyclical fluctuations in migration.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data source tabulates information on migration between every pair of states in each year from 1975 to 205. Specifically, they report the total number of tax exemptions that moved out of each of the 48 continental United States and moved into each of the other 47 states.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data represent a narrower population than the Current Population Survey in that it only reflects inividuals in households who filed tax returns in two consecutive years. On the other hand, these data comprise the total universe of tax filers, and so they are less susceptible to measurement error than the CPS.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…similar to the Current Population Survey, the Internal Revenue Service reports the number of migrants from the first quarter of one year to the first quarter of the following year. Therefore, researchers maintain the same timing of the business cycle that was described earlier: the employment gap and unemployment rates are averages from April in the previous year to March in the current year, and the UI claims rate is the rate in the previous calendar year.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers estimate linear regressions of migration on national and local economic conditions with the outcome being the migration flow.
169~DV4~L6~Variable Value~State Migration Flows~…researchers define migration between each pair of states as the total number of tax exemptions that moved from state J to state K in year T, relative to the initial number of exemptions in state J.
169~D2~V9~Variable~Tax Exemptions~…the total number of tax exemptions that moved from state J to state K in year t.
169~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Initial Tax Exemptions~…the initial number of exemptions in state J is defined as the number of non-moving exemptions plus the total number of exemptions that moved out of state J in that year.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…this data reports both the number of migrants moving from state J to state K as well as the number of migrants moving from state K to state J, so these data reflect gross migration patterns across states.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…represents national business cycle conditions, which are measured using each of the three variables of interest: the employment gap, the unemployment rate, or the UI claims rate.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers control for a wide variety of differences in relative economic opportunities across locations by including local business cycle, labor market, and housing market conditions in both the origin and destination state.
169~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Relative State-Level Conditions~…a set of variables representing relative business cycle conditions in the origin and destination states, computed as the difference between the equivalent state-level business cycle measure and the national business cycle conditions.
169~D5~DV21~Derived Variable~Relative Income Per Capita~…a set of variables representing relative income per capita in the origin and destination states.
169~D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Relative House Prices~…a set of variables representing the relative house prices in the origin and dstination states.
169~D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Relative House Prices~…house prices are measured using the OFHEO house price indexes.
169~D4~DV21~Derived Variable~Relative Income Per Capita~…income per capita is measure in logarithms and is lagged 1 year in order to mitigate endogeneity problems associated with a contemporaneous effect of migrants on wages and house prices.
169~D6~DV17~Derived Variable~Relative House Prices~…income per capita is measure in logarithms and is lagged 1 year in order to mitigate endogeneity problems associated with a contemporaneous effect of migrants on wages and house prices.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers include a separate fixed-effect and time trend for each origin and destination state. Because this specification directly accounts for reallocative shocks, the coefficient on the national business cycle will reflect purely the influence of aggregate shocks common across all locations.
169~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Fixed Effect~…researchers include a fixed-effect for each origin and destination state in ordinary-least square regressions.
169~D1, D2, D3~V13~Variable~Time Trend~…researchers include a time trend for each origin and destination state in ordinary-least square regressions.
169~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Fixed Effect~…this dummy variable captures smooth changes in migration flows between states over time, such as increased migration to Sunbelt states, as well as the numerous stable sending-receiving relationships between states.
169~D1, D2, D3~V13~Variable~Time Trend~…this dummy variable captures smooth changes in migration flows between states over time, such as increased migration to Sunbelt states, as well as the numerous stable sending-receiving relationships between states.
169~D1, D2, D3~F6~Findings~Correlation of Aggregate Conditions With Migration~…the correlation of aggregate conditions with migration is significant but small, corresponding to about a 0.03 standard deviation increase in migration for a 2 standard deviation improvement in aggregate employment relvate to trend.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…these regressions use the national logarithm of the number of migrants as the dependent variable instead of the migration rate.
169~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Fixed Effect~…a specification of the model includes a separate fixed effect and time trend for each individual pair of states (48*47=2256 pairs) yielded almost identical results, but estimating such a large number of parameters increased the computation time considerably.
169~D1, D2, D3~V13~Variable~Time Trend~…a specification of the model includes a separate fixed effect and time trend for each individual pair of states (48*47=2256 pairs) yielded almost identical results, but estimating such a large number of parameters increased the computation time considerably.
169~D1~F7~Findings~Number of Migrants and UI Claims~…regressions using the natural logarithm of the number of migrants as the dependent variable instead of the migration rate suggest that a 2-standard deviation increase in tge national employment gap is associated with a 4.5% increase in migration flows.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…because employment and the population state may partly depend on the number of workers flowing in and out, the coefficients on local economic conditions should not be interpreted as a causal effect of local labor and housing market conditions on migration.
169~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~UI Claims rate~…the UI claims rate is less susceptible to the concern that local economic conditions should not be interpreted as a causal effect of local labor and housing market conditions on migration than the other two business cycle measures because unemployment insurance claimants receive benefits from the state where they were last employed as opposed to the state where they currently reside. Thus, the UI claims rate is not a direct function of migration.
169~D1, D4, D7~F8~Findings~National Economic Conditions and UI Claims Rate~…the estimated effect of national economic conditions on migration is near other estimates in using the UI claims rate measure of the business cycle, as a two standard deviation improvement in the national UI claims rate corresponds to a 4.3% (or 0.04 standard deviation) increase in migration.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…to distinguish between the cost of buying and selling a home, researchers include the change in national house prices along with each of the researchers' labor-market based business cycle measures. Specifically, researchers use the change in the logarithm of the OFHEO repeat-transactions price index from the first quarter of the previous year to the first quarter of the current year.
169~D4, D5, D6, D7~F9~Findings~House Price and the Labor-Market Cycle~"…in every ""house price"" specification, the coefficient on the labor-market cycle is unchanged and the coefficient on national house prices changes is small and insignificantly different from zero. Thus, cyclical migration patters appear to be more closely tied to labor markets than to national housing."
169~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Relative State-Level Conditions~…to proxy for the range of opportunities facing a potential migrant, reserachers calculate a distance-weighted average of relative state-level conditions, excluding conditions in the origin state. 
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…using the calculated distance-weighted average of relative state-level conditions, excluding conditions in the origin state, researchers a function of migration flows either into or out of each state from all of the other 47 states.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…as before, this method includes regressors such as the national business cycle, the local business cycle conditions in each state, the income per capita and house prices, and the distance-weighted averages of each of these state economic conditions in all other states. This specification offers an advantage over the point-to-point model in that it can be estimated for inter-MSA migration (inflows and outflows) as well as inter-state migration. An additional difference between these specifications and thos prior is that researchers do not include distance-weighted averages of conditions in other locations, because there does not exist any data on the distance between each pair of metropolitan areas. Excluding the distance weighted average of state conditions does not significantly chagne the estimated business cycle coefficients.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F10~Findings~National Economic Conditions and Net Migration Flows~…the effect of a two standard deviation improvement in national conditions ranges from a 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviation, or equivalently, a 4% to 8% increase in both inmigration and outmigration. These results show that yet another method of controlling for differences in relative economic conditions points to a significant role for the national business cycle in explaining internal migration.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…researchers use data from the Internal Revenue Service's county-to-county migration files to calculate total migration into and out of each metropolitan area in the United States. Because these files only report migration between pairs of counties with at least a moderate population flow between the two locations, researchers cannot calculate migration between pairs of metropolitan areas to estimate a regression analogous to the state-pair regressions. However, the files do report total migration into and out of each countru, so researchers are able to aggregate the data into total inflows and total outflows for each metropolitan area.
169~D2~T7~Time Period~1981, 1984-2005~…files that report total migration into and out of each country are available for tax returns filed in 1981 and 1984-2005.
169~DV11~L4~Variable Value~Employment Gap~…unemployment rates for individual counties or MSAs are not available prior to 1990, so in all equations reserachers use the employment gap to proxy for the local business cycle.
169~DV11~L4~Variable Value~Employment Gap~…this gap is calculated from annual employment estimates by county from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which are available from 1969-2005.
169~D7~T8~Time Period~1969-2005~…time period from which Bureau of Economic Analysis data is drawn to calculate the employment gap from annual employment estimates by county.
169~D7~D7~Dataset~Bureau of Economic Analysis~…data source used to calculate the employment gap from annual employment estimates by county, available from 1969-2005.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…regressions include income per capita and the OFHEO house price index in the previous year.
169~D6~V10~Variable~OFHEO House Price Index~…the OFHEO did not start calculating the house price indexes for many of these metropolitan areas until 1985 or even later, so the sample is an unbalanced panel as more areas with non-missing house price values are included over time.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Log-Linear~…regression results are similar when the sample is limited to a balanced panel of 122 metropolitan areas with non-missing house price information in 1980.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D6, D7~F11~Findings~National Economic Conditions, Local Conditions and Migration Rates~…a 2 standard deviation improvement in national economic conditions is associated with a 1% to 3% (or 0.02 to 0.06 standard deviation) increase in migration. For the most part, local economic conditions are statistically significant and have the expected sign. One interesting exception is that out-migration does not appear to be related to local business cycle conditions even though more individuals move into the area when local conditions improve.
169~D1, D6~V23~Variable~Metropolitan Areas~…researchers define the metropolitan areas according to the 2006 Census definition.
169~DV22~L7~Variable Value~Inmigration~…although researchers are able to net out migration from the majority of counties in the same metropolitan area, a few nearby counties with small migration flows might be excluded from the IRS reports. Therefore, the estimates of immigration and outmigration may be biased upward slightly.
169~DV22~L8~Variable Value~Outmigration~…although researchers are able to net out migration from the majority of counties in the same metropolitan area, a few nearby counties with small migration flows might be excluded from the IRS reports. Therefore, the estimates of immigration and outmigration may be biased upward slightly.
169~D1, D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Net Migration Flows~…although researchers are able to net out migration from the majority of counties in the same metropolitan area, a few nearby counties with small migration flows might be excluded from the IRS reports. Therefore, the estimates of immigration and outmigration may be biased upward slightly.
169~DV22~L7~Variable Value~Inmigration~…people moving from another labor market may predominantly comprise in-migrants.
169~Dv22~L8~Variable Value~Outmigration~…out-migrants are comprised both of people moving to new labor markets and to suburbs and satellite towns not included in the MSA. This group may buffer the procyclicality of inmigration flows.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the primary source of data for individual-level analysis determining which segments of the population are most influenced by aggregate business cycle conditions in making their migration decisions.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source provides the largest nationally representative sample that covers a considerable number of business cycles. However, the Current Population Survey is a cross section and does not provide information on migrants prior to their move.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…researchers use this data to test for cyclical differences across individual and household characteristics across individual and household characteristics - like employment or marital status - that may change during a move.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the relevant Current Population Survey microdata come from the March surveys from 1964 to 2003, again excluding the years in which CPS respondents were not asked whether they resided in their current country one year ago.
169~D1~T9~Time Period~1964-2003~…survey period from which microdata is drawn from the March Current Population Survey.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample is restricted to household heads, ages 18 to 65, since household heads are most likely to make migration decisions for a family. Reserachers control for family structure characteristics that may influence migration costs, like the presence of children. Minors are excluded since they are unlikely to make migration decisions independently, as well those over the age of 65 since migration during retirement years is likely to be qualitatively different from migration during the prime years of employment. Because the sample is restricted to household heads, women are significantly underrepresented in the data.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…researchers compute linear probability models in which the dependent variable is equal to one if a respondent currently residing in state S moved across county lines in the previous year.
169~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~Migration Decision~…a binary variable equal to one if a respondent currently residing in state S moved across county lines in the previous year (and zero otherwise).
169~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…changes in the demographic characteristics of the population will lead to fluctuations in the aggregate migration rate.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…represents one of the three measures of the national cycle.
169~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Relative State-Level Conditions~…represents local economic conditions in the individual's current state of residence (i.e. a migrant's destination state).
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source does not identify a migrant's state of origin, nor does it provide information on an individual's personal characteristics in the previous year. Therefore, reserachers cannot control for local economic conditions in the origin state or for any more sophisticated measures of the ex ante array of state conditions facing a potential migrant.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…the linear probability models also include controls for basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…these include dummy variables for six age groups, four educational attainment categories, race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, the presence of children, and three categories of employment states.
169~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…it is important to keep in mind that for migrants, these demographic characteristics are all observed after the change in location has been made.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…researchers also control for a quadratic time trend to capture smooth long-term changes in the population's propensity to migrate.
169~D1, D3~V15~Variable~Time Trend~…a quadratic time trend included in linear probability models in order to capture smooth long-term changes in the population's propensity to migrate.
169~D1, D3~V16~Variable~Age Group~…dummy variables for six aggregated age groups as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V17~Variable~Educational Attainment~…dummy variables for four educational attainment categories as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V24~Variable~Gender~…dummy variables controlling for gender as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V18~Variable~Race~…dummy variables controlling for race as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V19~Variable~Ethnicity~…dummy variables controlling for ethnicity as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V20~Variable~Marital Status~…dummy variables controlling for ethnicity as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V21~Variable~Children Presence~…dummy variables controlling for the presence of children as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~D1, D3~V22~Variable~Employment Status~…dummy variables for three categories of employment status as included in a vector of basic demographic characteristics.
169~V22~L9~Variable Value~Employed~…one of three educational categories specifying that a respondent is employed at the time of survey.
169~V22~L10~Variable Value~Unemployed~…one of three educational categories specifying that a respondent is unemployed at the time of survey.
169~V22~L11~Variable Value~Not in the Labor Force~…one of three educational categories specifying that a respondent is not in the labor force at the time of survey.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in some years, states with a small population were not separately identified in the Current Population Survey, but were grouped together with other small states.
169~D1, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Relative State-Level Conditions~…in some years, states with a small population were not separately identified in the Current Population Survey, but were grouped together with other small states. In these cases, researchers calculate local state conditions as an average of the business cycle conditions across the component states of the group.
169~D1, D3, D4, D7~F12~Findings~Annual Unemployment and Probability of Migration~…the coefficient of -0.21 on the annual unemployment rate implies that a percentage point change in the national unemployment rate reduces an individual's probability of moving between counties by 0.21 percentage ponts. Thus a two standard deviation change in the national unemployment rate would lead to decrease in the annual internal migration rate of roughly 0.63 percentage points, a 10% decline from the average annual inter-county migration rate of 6%.
169~D1, D2, D3, D7~F13~Findings~Employment Gap and Internal Migration~…the positive coefficient on the employment gap show that the internal migration increases when employment growth is above trend. In this case, a two standard deviation swing in employment around its trend generates a change in the probability of inter-county migration of 0.4 percentage points, a bit smaller than the change generated by a similar swing in the national unemployment rate.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source samples physical household locations.
169~D1, D4, D7~F14~Findings~The Employment Gap, Unemployment Rate, and UI Claims~…in unreported results, coefficients on the employment gap, the unemployment rate and the UI claims rate were 0.10, -0.0025, and -0.049, respectively, in regressions omitting controls for state relative conditions.
169~D1, D2, D3~F15~Findings~State Line Moves vs. State or County Line Moves~…3% of the relevant sample moves across state lines in a given year while 6% move across state or county lines.
169~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F16~Findings~Leads and Lags and Business Cycle Conditions~…including leads and lags of one year in the state and national business cycle measures does not substantially alter the point estimates on current-year business cycle conditions, although it greatly reduces their precision. The exception to this result is the UI claims rate, which is more sensitive to the inclusion of leads and lags.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…to examine whether the national business cycle impacts the migration choices of certain individuals more than others, researchers interact the business cycle measures with dummy variables for various demographic groups according to a linear probability specification.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…the interacted specification includes a vector of dummy variables for a particular group characteristic and a vector of all other control variables. Note that this specification allows for both national and local state economic conditions to vary by demographic group.
169~DV3~L12~Variable Value~Particular Group Characteristic~…represents a vector of dummy variables for a particular group characteristic.
169~DV3~L13~Variable Value~Other Control Characteristics~…represents a vector of dummy variables for all other control variables.
169~D1, D3~V17~Variable~Educational Attainment~…it is unlikely that many individuals changed their educational attainment in the year covered by their survey responses. The one age group that is the exception to this is the 18 to 25 year olds. Therefore, linear probability model results are robust to excluding these younger workers who may still be in the process of obtaining high education.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…it is unlikely that many individuals changed their educational attainment in the year covered by their survey responses. The one age group that is the exception to this is the 18 to 25 year olds. Therefore, linear probability model results are robust to excluding these younger workers who may still be in the process of obtaining high education.
169~V16~L14~Variable Value~18 to 24 Years Old~…the one age group that has an elevated propensity to change their educational attainment in the year covered their survey responses.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…the effect of business cycle conditions on the youngest individuals in the sample, i.e. those 18 to 24, is shown by the level effect of the national economic condition variables.
169~D1, D3, D4, D7~F17~Findings~National Economic Conditions and Demographic Interaction Terms~…the coefficient estimates of national economic conditions are much larger in magnitude than the estimates for the entire sample. The interaction terms of these measures with dummy variables for older age groups show that the responsiveness of migration to business cycle conditions declines with age. This results may indicate that the benefit to moving is larger for younger individuals, which would be the case if younger workers have less local- or firm-specific human capital. Lower migration costs might also make younger workers particularly sensitive to changes in the benefits to migration, since they have a longer time horizon over which to accumulate rewards.
169~D1, D3~V24~Variable~Gender~…used to specify for the fact that women are less attached to the labor force.
169~D1, D3~V18~Variable~Race~…used to specify for the fact that minorities are less attached to the labor force.
169~D1, D3~V17~Variable~Educational Attainment~…an individual's educational level may be related to the costs and benefits of migration through a number of channels, but on balance, it is not clear whether researchers should expect the cyclicality of migration to increase or decrease with education.
169~D1, D3, D7~F18~Findings~Employment Gap and Education~…when national conditions are measured using the employment gap, workers with more education, particularly college graduates, make more procyclical migration choices than high school graduates. However, this result is reversed when national conditions are measured using the unemployment rate and the UI claims rate. In those cases, migration choices of more educated workers are insulated from the effects of the national cycle.
169~V17~L15~Variable Value~High School Graduates~…this category is eliminated in regressional analysis due to collinearity.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…researchers alter the specifications of this model by estimating a fully interacted version where national and state economic conditions are allowed to vary with all personal characteristics simultaneously. In this model, the coefficient on national economic conditions reflects the cyclicality of currently-employed, young, white male high school graduates who are unmarried and have no children.
169~D4, D7~DV11~Derived Variable~Business Cycle Conditions~…researchers alter the specifications of the linear probability model by estimating a fully interacted version where national and state economic conditions are allowed to vary with all personal characteristics simultaneously. In this model, the coefficient on national economic conditions reflects the cyclicality of currently-employed, young, white male high school graduates who are unmarried and have no children.
169~V17~L18~Variable Value~High School Dropouts~…dropouts are also insulated from the effect of the national cycle as measured by the UI claims rate. This may be because dropouts are less likely to be in jobs covered by UI (as compared to high school graduates and those with some college) and are thus less sensitive to the cycle as measured by UI claims fluctuations.
169~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~Migration Decision~…researchers believe that migration decisions are primarily made at the household level, which leads to the choice of prime-aged household heads as the unit of analysis.
169~D1, D3~V16~Variable~Age Group~…because household members are likely to differ greatly by age, this variation obscures the differential migration choices made by younger household heads.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…researchers use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data to examine characteristics that may change during the course of an individual's migration period.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…unlike the Current Population Survey, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics allows researchers to observe employment and homeownership both pre- and post-move.
169~D1, D3~V22~Variable~Employment Status~…as a major category of interest from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data because the unemployed face lower migration costs relative to individuals who must either sell their homes or give up their current job.
169~D3~V25~Variable~Homeownership Status~…as a major category of interest from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data because renters face lower migration costs relative to individuals who must either sell their homes or give up their current job.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…this data source provides annual information on an individual's state of residence from 1968 to 1993. 
169~D3~T10~Time Period~1968-1993~…survey period from which Panel Study of Income Dynamics data is drawn.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…this data sample is limited to household heads between the ages of 18 and 65, for a total of about 130,000 observations (roughly 1/10 the size of the Current Population Survey).
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…regressions using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data do not include state-level controls because the sample is too small to separately identify so many interactions, but point estimates are similar when these controls are included.
169~D1, D3~V16~Variable~Age Group~…to highlight the influence of age on the cyclicality of migration patterns, researchers split the Panel Study of Income Dynamics into two household head age groups.
169~V16~L16~Variable Value~18 to 35 Year Olds~…the younger of two aggregated household head age groups from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
169~V16~L17~Variable Value~36 to 64 Year Olds~…the older of two aggregated household head age groups from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
169~D1, D3~DV20~Derived Variable~Employment Status Transitions~…shows how the cyclicality of migration varies for workers making three different types of employment status transitions.
169~DV20~L19~Variable Value~Job Finders~…researchers define job finders as individuals who are currently employed but were unemployed or not-in-the-labor-force in the previous period.
169~DV20~L20~Variable Value~Job Seekers~…researchers define job seekers as those who were either unemployed or not-in-the-labor-force in the previous period and unemployed in the current period.
169~DV20~L21~Variable Value~Job Separators~…researchers define job separators as those who were employed in the previous period and currently unemployed or not-in-the-labor-force.
169~DV20~L22~Variable Value~Job Stayers~…the omitted group includes individuals who were employed in both periods as well as those not in the labor force in either period and those who transitioned out of the labor force from unemployment.
169~D1, D3~F19~Findings~Employment Transitions for the Younger Age Group~…for the younger age group, job finders and seekers have more procyclical migration propensities than individuals in the omitted category. However, these transitions cannot completely account for the cyclical migration behavior of young workers, as even the migration patterns of the baseline group are also somewhat procyclical. By contrast, none of the employment transitions of older household heads are cyclical. These results suggest that young individuals migrate to take advantage of new job opportunities more than older people, perhaps because they have less location-specific capital to lose and a longer horizon over which to reap the benefits of investing in a new location. Job separations are not correlated with the cyclical component of either age group.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the state of residence is provided biannually in 1997, 2001 and 2003, but researchers view 2-year migration periods as too long to observe moves related to business cycle conditions.
169~D1, D3~V26~Variable~State of Residence~…the state of residence is provided biannually in 1997, 2001 and 2003 in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, but researchers view 2-year migration periods as too long to observe moves related to business cycle conditions.
169~D1, D3, D4~F20~Findings~Cyclicality of Migration and Homeownership Status~…the cyclicality of migration does not vary by prior-year homeownership status once the correlation between homeownership and the presence of children is taken into account. Therefore, national fluctuations in the net cost of moving are unlikely to be related to the adjustment costs associated with selling a home, providing further evidence that these cyclical migration patterns are more closely related to labor markets than to housing markets.
169~D2~D2~Dataset~Internal Revenue Service~…source of data on inter-state and inter-metropolitan population flows.
169~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…source of data used to assess whether migration rates of certain demographic groups are more procyclical than others.
169~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…source of data used to assess whether migration rates of certain demographic groups are more procyclical than others.
169~D5~DV16~Derived Variable~Dispersion in MSA Level conditions~…it is possible that the controls for relative employment, unemployment, income and house prices do not adequately capture the true dispersion in local economic conditions across local markets. However, this possibility is unlikely because the addition of the local controls that are observed have little impact on the estimates of aggregate cyclicality. In order for omitted time-varying differences across locations to explain the results, these differences would have to be uncorrelated with the observable controls.
169~V16~L14~Variable Value~18 to 24 Years Old~…the youngest of six aggregated age groups.
169~V16~L23~Variable Value~25 to 30 Years Old~…the second youngest of six aggregated age groups.
169~V16~L24~Variable Value~31 to 35 Years Old~…the third youngest of six aggregated age groups.
169~V16~L25~Variable Value~36 to 45 Years Old~…the third oldest of six aggregated age groups.
169~V16~L26~Variable Value~46 to 55 Years Old~…the second oldest of six aggregated age groups.
169~V16~L27~Variable Value~56 to 65 Years Old~…the oldest of six aggregated age groups.
169~D1, D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Migration Rates~…all migration rates are detrended using a Hodrick-Prescott filter.
169~DV11~L4~Variable Value~Employment Gap~…the employment gap is defined as the logarithm of employment relative to a Hodrick-Prescott trend, averaged from April to March.
169~DV11~L5~Variable Value~National Unemployment Rate~…the unemployment rate is an average from April to March.
169~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~UI Claims rate~…the UI claims rate is the annual average during the previous calendar year.
169~DV4~L28~Variable Value~MSA-Level Migration Flows~…the total number of migrants entering or leaving MSA J in year t from all other 358 continental MSAs
169~V17~L18~Variable Value~High School Dropouts~…one of four aggregated educational categories.
169~V17~L29~Variable Value~Some College~…one of four aggregated educational categories.
169~V17~L30~Variable Value~College~…one of four aggregated educational categories.
169~V18~L31~Variable Value~Black~…the minority-based race-specific dummy variable.
169~V19~L32~Variable Value~Hispanic~…the minority-based ethnic-specific dummy variable.
169~DV20~L19~Variable Value~Job Finders~…job finders are defined as either an unemployed-to-employed or not-in-the-labor-force-to-employed transition.
169~DV20~L20~Variable Value~Job Seekers~…job seekers are defined as either a not-in-the-labor-force-to-unemployed transition or a household head who was unemployed both in the previous and current year.
169~DV20~L21~Variable Value~Job Separators~…job separations are defined as an employed-to-unemployed or employed-to-not-in-the-labor-force transition. 
169~DV20~L22~Variable Value~Job Stayers~…the omitted category includes individuals who were employed in both periods, not-in-the-labor-force in both periods, or who transitioned from unemployment to not-in-the-labor force.
169~D1, D3~M3~Methodology~Linear Probability Models~…all regressions include controls for age, gender, marital status, presence of kids, number of kids, race, ethnicity, education, current and previous year employment status, current and previous year homeownership and a quadratic time trend.
169~D1, D3~V27~Variable~Number of Kids~…a regressor included in linear probability model regressions specifying for the number of kids present in a respondent's home.
170~170: Labor Supply at the Extensive and Intensive Margins: The EITC, Welfare, and Hours Worked~~~~
170~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
170~D1~V1~Variable~EITC Benefits~…the Earned income Tax Credit changes during the 1990-1996 period sharply altered the budget sets of single mothers over a short period of time.
170~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1990-1996~…the Earned income Tax Credit changes during the 1990-1996 period sharply altered the budget sets of single mothers over a short period of time.
170~D1~V1~Variable~EITC Benefits~…the EITC unequivocally encourages single parents to work at least some hours during a year because it shift out the budget set at all positive hours points.
170~D1~V1~Variable~EITC Benefits~…theory implies that the EITC will decrease hours worked among those already working because most recipients are on the plateau or phase-out portions of the credit schedule. For these recipients, the EITC reduces or does not affect the affect-tax wage while at the same time discouraging work through the income effect of the credit payment.
170~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1986-2000~…during the 1986 to 2000 period, incentives to work during the year changed sharply.
170~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1990-1997~…the author focuses particularly on the longer period for context and some comparisons. 
170~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1990-1997~…over this period, tax incentives almost entirely from the EITC increased annual net-of-tax earnings by an amount just under $1,000, on average, for single mothers (who earned $18,164, on average).
170~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1990-1996~…over the six years starting in 1990, the maximum EITC credit rose from $953 for all families to $2,152 for families with one child and $3,556 for those with two or more children.
170~D1, D2~T4~Time Period~1994-1996~…sharply stronger credit incentives for families with two or more children began in 1994 and steadily increased through 1996.
170~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1990-1997~…the EITC was unchanged in real terms after 1996, but the author includes this survey year in the analysis period because past researcher has suggested a lagged effect of EITC changes.
170~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Pre-Tax Earnings~…to determine the relevance of different parts of the EITC schedule for different groups, this research examines the pre-tax earnings distribution of single mothers.
170~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Pre-Tax Earnings~…among mothers with less than a high-school degree, 45% had earnings in the EITC phase-in region. For those with more than a high school degree, the corresponding number was 14%.
170~D1~V1~Variable~EITC Benefits~…among mothers with less than a high-school degree, 95% received some credit if they had two or more children. For those with more than a high school degree, the corresponding number was 65%.
170~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1990-1997~…toward the end of the 1990 to 1997 period and accelerating after this period, welfare reform sharply increased the incentives to do some work. For many single mothers, the welfare reform occuring throughout this period removed the possibility of receiving support without working.
170~D2~V3~Variable~Subsidy Rate~…the rate at which EITC benefits are paid out, as a percentage of earnings, to individuals at various low-income levels.
170~V3~L1~Variable Value~Phase-In Subsidy Rate~…the EITC expansions occuring throughout the 1990's raised the phase-in subsidy rate from 14% in 1990 to 34% for one-child families and 40% for families with two or more children in 1996.
170~V3~L1~Variable Value~Phase-In Subsidy Rate~…because the phase-in range for two-child families ends at $8,890, this part of the schedule is mostly relevant for low-skilled mothers. Only 14% of those with more than a high school education earn less than $8,890, and thus other parts of the schedule are much more important for these women.
170~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Pre-Tax Earnings~…because the phase-in range for two-child families ends at $8,890, this part of the schedule is mostly relevant for low-skilled mothers. Only 14% of those with more than a high school education earn less than $8,890, and thus other parts of the schedule are much more important for these women.
170~V3~L2~Variable Value~Phase-Out Subsidy Rate~…the phase-out rate, an implicit tax on earnings, rose from 10% to just over 21% for those with two or more children and just 16% for those with one child and applied to many more people after the credit expansions of the 1990s.
170~D1~D1~Dataset~NBER~…to quantify the hours disincentives due to the EITC changes, the author uses the National Bureau of Economic Research's TAXSIM program to calculate the mean change in the tax bill and the marginal tax rate between 1990 and 1996 for single mothers with different levels of education.
170~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hours Disincentives~…to quantify the hours disincentives due to the EITC changes, the author uses the National Bureau of Economic Research's TAXSIM program to calculate the mean change in the tax bill and the marginal tax rate between 1990 and 1996 for single mothers with different levels of education.
170~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Mean Tax Bill Change~…the mean change in the tax bill between 1990 and 1996 for single mothers with different levels of education.
170~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Marginal Tax Rate~…the marginal tax rate between 1990 and 1996 for single mothers with different levels of education.
170~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Mean Tax Bill Change~…for this calculation, the author assumes that the distribution of real earnings after 1990, conditional on working, would be the same as that from 1984 to 1990.
170~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Marginal Tax Rate~…for this calculation, the author assumes that the distribution of real earnings after 1990, conditional on working, would be the same as that from 1984 to 1990.
170~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Elasticities, Hours Worked, and Education~…using an income elasticity of 0.2 and a wage elasticity of 1.0, hours worked are predicted to decline between 1990 and 1996 by 1.7% for those with a high-school degree and 2.8% for those with some college.
170~D2~V4~Variable~Employment Rates~…the author eports the employment rates of single mothers and single childless women, by education and family size, by year for 1986-2000.
170~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1986-2000~…time period for which the employment rates of single mothers and single childless women are reported  by education and family size.
170~D2~F2~Findings~Single Mother Employment and Low Education~…the employment of single mothers without a high-school degree rose 22% between 1990 and 1997. Between 1986 and 2000, the employment of this group rose 60%.
170~D2~F3~Findings~Single Mother Employment and High Education~…between 1990 and 1997, those with a high-school degree saw their employment rise 8%, while over the full time period it rose 17%. The corresponding numbers for those with more than a high-school education are 3% and 8%.
170~D1, D2~T4~Time Period~1994-1996~…time period during which the two-child credit became relatively much larger.
170~D2~F4~Findings~Two-Child Credit Introduction and Employment Rates~…from 1994 to 1996, when the two-child credit became relatively much larger, the employment rate of those with two or more children rose sharply from 0.712 to 0.769.
170~D2~V5~Variable~Weeks Worked~…the author reports weeks worked conditional on working for single mothers and single childless women, by year for the 1986-2000 period.
170~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1986-2000~…time period for which the weeks worked per year were reported, conditional on working, for single mothers and single childless women
170~D2~F5~Findings~Weeks Worked and Education~…weeks worked by mothers with a high-school education were constant over the EITC expansion period of the 1990's, while weeks for those with more than a high-school education appear to have risen very slightly. The changes in weeks for these groups of single mothers are not in agreement wit standard predictions that implied that weeks worked would have fallen in response to the adverse income and substitution effects of the EITC expansions among more-educated single mothers.
170~D2~V6~Variable~Hours Worked~…the author reports usual hours worked per week conditional on working for single mothers and single childless women over the 1986 to 2000 period.
170~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1986-2000~…time period for which the hours worked per week are reported, conditional on working, for single mothers and single childless women.
170~D2~F6~Findings~Hours Worked and Education~...the usual hours of work per week for single mothers are remarkably constant. This constancy is also apparent for single women without children. Again, the lack of a decline in hours over the 1990 to 1997 period for those with a high-school education, and for those with greater than a high-school education, is inconsistent with the predicted effects of the EITC.
170~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1990-1997~…over the 1990 to 1997 period, real mean and median hourly earnings for single mothers and single childless women with a high-school degree or more education declined slightly.
170~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Welfare Receipts~…the author reports welfare receipt rates over the period from 1986 to 2000.
170~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1986-2000~…time period for which welfare receipt rates and the fraction of single mothers who combined work and welfare are reported.
170~D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Fraction of Work and Welfare~…the researcher reports the fraction of single mothers who combined work and welfare over the period from 1986 to 2000.
170~D2~F7~Findings~Fraction of Work and Welfare and Education~…for the two higher-educated groups, the fraction of single mothers combining work and welfare does not clearly fall below the early 1990's rate until 1999. Thus, a fall in the share of these mothers with low weeks and hours worked is not the explanation for the lack of a decline in weeks and hours worked by the groups with a high-school degree or more education. The author also examined the mean hours and weeks worked by those combining work and welfare. These numbers do rise by 1999, but the increase is small and late in the study period.
170~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Result Implication 1~…estimated results suggest that incentives affecting the labor supply of single mothers work almost exclusively through the participation margin.
170~D2~F9~Findings~Result Implication 2~…estimated results offer a challenge to determine what pattern of costs of work and what utility function shape might be consistent with nearly all of the labor-supply response occuring on the participation margin. Alternatively, it may be necessary to consider what type of constraints on hours and weeks choices should be incorportaed in labor-supply models.
170~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Result Implication 3~…estimated results suggest that policy simulations that do not recognize the unresponsiveness of single mothers' labor supply on the intensive margin may give biased estimates.
170~D2~V7~Variable~Education Level~…education level is a proxy for income, as individuals with higher educational attainment will be more likely to have higher income and, in turn, less likely to receive welfare benefits.

171~D1~T1~Time Period~1940-1990~…a fifty year time period of data from the United States Decennial Census that allows to subsume all the time-periods examined by previous studies, allowing simple comparison of estimates.
171~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source has the advantage of producing a fairly consistent yearly time-series from 1964 onward; however, it does not sample members of the armed forces and contains no information on the incarcerated population, the former of which causes the researcher to overstate the racial wage gap because it ignores the significant role of employment in the armed forces in compressing the racial wage gap and the latter of which ignores the role of increasing criminal activity as a response to a changing wage structure.
171~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the analysis is restricted to men because the extent of nonemployment amongblack women has fallen over time, in sharp contrast to the increase for black men.
171~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the analysis is restricted to prime working age men, aged 22 to 55, so that the results are not contaminated by the increasing prevalence of early retirement among men or the fact that a substantial fraction of younger cohorts in the 20 to 25 age group are enrolled in college.

171~D1, D3, D4~F1~Findings~Dropout Labor Force Participation From 1940 to 1990~…in 1940 a little less than 7% of blacks aged 25 to 55 who were high school dropouts were not in the labor force or institutionalized, while by 1990, this number had grown to almost 35%.
171~D1, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Weekly Wages~…reported for each year of data for whites and blacks.
171~D1, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Racial Wage Gap~…the ratio of average weekly wages for prime age black males to prime age white males.

171~D1, D3, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Relative Earnings Ratio~…the racial wage gap provided for once the unemployed are accounted for.
171~D1, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Cell Minimum Estimator~…the matching estimator that relies on using cell-minima as estimates of the earnings of the nonemployed provides estimates that are between those obtained from the Brown estimator and the cell-mean-based matching estimator.
171~D1, D2, D3, D4~F3~Findings~Wage Gap Improvements~…regardless of the estimator chosen to correct for nonemployment, it is evident that during the 1960's black males made substantial gains relative to their white counterparts with blacks increasing in observed average weekly earnings from 149 in 1940 to 602 in 1990 and whites increasing in observed average weekly earnings from 308 in 1940 to 7999 in 1990.

172~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this research paper uses individual-level data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to ask some basic questions about the experiences of different skill classes over the last 30 years of the United States business cycle, paying particular attention to the most recent recession.
172~D2~V1~Variable~Occupation Group~…to partially control for industry effects, in most of the analysis middle-skill workers are separated into three subclasses - middle-skill manufacturing, middle-skill construction, and middle-skill other. Adding high- and low-skill workers from all industries to the three middle-skill groups gives researchers a total of five industry-skill groups to analyze.
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…the job-finding rate is defined as the rate at which unemployed workers find jobs. This definition does not account for employment-to-employment flows or transitions into and out of the labor force.
172~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Job-Separation Rate~…the job-separation rate is defined as the rate at which employed workers enter the unemployment pool. This definition does not account for employment-to-employment flows or transitions into and out of the labor force.
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…because researchers want to know how worker skills affect job-finding probabilities, finding rates are calculated only for workers who held a previous job; that is, unemployed workers who are new entrants to the labor force are excluded.

172~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics~…the classification system that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to code occupations has changed near the start of each decade; fortunately, Meyer and Osborne (2005) create a classification system that generates consistent occupational categories over time. Yet, while the Meyer-Osborne system has the advantage of consistency, it also has hundreds of entries. Researchesr borrow from Autor and Don (2009) and Autor (2010) that aggregated the Meyer-Osborne occupations into the 10 coarser occupations.

172~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the unemployment rates are adjusted for seasonal variation with a simple regression-based adjustment.
172~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Manufacturing Employment Over the Relevant Period~…workers in the production, craft, and repair group suffered jobless rates of approximately 15% during both the early 1980s and during the Great Recession. Unemployment rates for operators, fabricators, and laborers top out at more than 20% in the early 1980s and somewhat less than that recently.
172~V1~L1~Variable Value~High Skill Occupations~…at the start of the sample period, more than 80% of high-skill jobs were outside of manufacturing and construction; that share has risen even higher since then.
172~V1~L5~Variable Value~Middle Skill Other~…the share of middle-skill jobs outside of manufacturing and construction has been rising throughout the sample period, but starting from a smaller initial value than high-skill workers, so that today more than 20% of middle-skill work remains in manufacturing.

172~DV4~L7~Variable Value~Manufacturing Employment~…as a share of total employment, manufacturing employment has been shrinking for most of the postwar era. It has been shrinking in absolute terms since the 2001 recession.
172~DV4~L8~Variable value~Construction Employment~…as a share of total employment, construction employment has generally fluctuated from 4% to 6$ of total employment since the 1950s.
172~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Middle Skill Employment~…manufacturing and construction are heavily represented in middle-skill employment.
172~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~High Skill Employment~…manufacturing and construction account for nontrivial shares of high-skill employment.
172~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~High Skill Employment~…researchers could separate manufacturing and construction employment from high-skill employment, as is done for middle-skill employment, but increasing the number of industry-skill groups would complicate the analysis; in particular, doing so could render the statistical models estimated in the remaining analysis less informative.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…researchers run robustness checks to make sure that any interesting results they find do not stem from the inclusion of some manufacturing and construction workers in the high-skill group.

Shortly after the 1990-1991 recession, high-skill employment pulls away from the other two groups, leaving the middle-other and low-skill groups to grow together until the 2001 recession.
172~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 2001, a Current Population Survey classification change causes measured low-skil employment to jump, making further trend comparisons difficult after this point.

172~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the unemployment rates are adjusted for seasonal effects but not demographic composition.
172~DV4~L8~Variable Value~Construction Employment~…the middle-construction unemployment rate corresponds only to construction workers with mid-level skills, while the published unemployment rate is relevant for all construction workers. However, data shows that 80% of construction employment is middle-skill. This fact implies a close correspondence between the middle-construction unemployment rate and the published rate for all construction workers.

This fact implies a close correspondence between the middle-construction unemployment rate and the published rate for all construction workers.
172~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the unemployment rates vary across groups because workers flow in and out of unemployment at different rates.
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…job flows are calculated for those Current Population Survey respondents who have been matched across consecutive survey months.

172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…to ensure that these flows reflect cyclical forces, the flows are adjusted in several ways. To account for changing demographics, researchers run year-specific, individual-level logit regressions for each of the five industry-skill groups. To calculate the adjusted job-finding probabilities for one of the groups, researchers use year-specific logit coefficients to generate a series of expected job-finding probabilities for a typical worker in that group.

To calculate the adjusted job-separation probabilities for one of the groups, researchers use year-specific logit coefficients to generate a series of expected job-separation probabilities for a typical worker in that group.
172~D1, D2~M4~Methodology~Logit~"…to account for chainging demographics, researchers run year-specific, individual-level logit regressions for each of the five industry-skill groups to ensure that the job flow rates reflect cyclical forces. The regressors in this model are demographic demographic variables reflecting race, marital status, gender, education and age. This approach generates separate sets of demographic coefficients that vary by year for each of the five groups. To calculate the adjusted job-finding probabilites for one of the groups, researchers use these year-specific logit coefficients to generate a series of expected job-finding probabilities for a ""typical worker"" in that group. Adjustments for job-separation rates are figured similarly, using logits modeling the probability that an employed worker will transition to unemployment."
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…after adjusting the job flows for demographic composition, these flows are then adjusted for time-aggregation. Researchers follow the method concurrently proposed by Shimer (2011) and Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2012) by using the eigen values from the transition matrix of unadjusted flows to back out the implied continuous-time flow probabilities of moving from employment to unemployment or vice vers. Using these continuous-time probabilities, one can then calculate the probability of moving from employment to unemployment, or vice-versa, from month t to t+1, abstracting from the possibility that a new job can be found before the next survey date occurs.

172~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…when a worker in the Current Population Survey loses a job, the worker has on average about two weeks to find a new job before the Current Population Survey's next monthly survey week. If the worker does find a job, then the Current Population Survey will not record the job separation, causing the measured job-separation rate to be too low.
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…finally, to seasonally adjust a time series, researchers simply regress the series on a constant and a set of quarterly dummies, omitting the dummy for the first quarter of the year. The seasonally adjusted series is the constant from this regression plus the residual.
172~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Job-Separation Rate~…finally, to seasonally adjust a time series, researchers simply regress the series on a constant and a set of quarterly dummies, omitting the dummy for the first quarter of the year. The seasonally adjusted series is the constant from this regression plus the residual.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M5~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to seasonally adjust a time series, researchers simply regress the series on a constant and a set of quarterly dummies, omitting the dummy for the first quarter of the year. The seasonally adjusted series is the constant from this regression plus the residual
172~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Typical Worker~…the typical worker is defined as one with demographic characteristics equal to the within-group sample average.
172~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Continuous-Time Flow Probabilities~…the approach of accounting for time-aggregation bias uses the eigenvalues from the transition matrix of unadjusted flows to back out the implied continuous-time flow probabilities of moving from employment to unemployment or vice versa.
172~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Continuous-Time Flow Probabilities~…these probabilities can be used to calculate the probability of moving from employment to unemployment, or vice versa, from month t to t+1, abstracting from the possibility that a new job can be found before the next survey date occurs.
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…the full time-aggregation correction described in Shimer (2011) and Elsby, Jobijn, and Sahin (2012) also allows transitions to and from labor-market nonparticipation, but the current research abstracts from nonparticipation in adjusting flow rates.
172~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Job-Separation Rate~…the full time-aggregation correction described in Shimer (2011) and Elsby, Jobijn, and Sahin (2012) also allows transitions to and from labor-market nonparticipation, but the current research abstracts from nonparticipation in adjusting flow rates.
172~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Job-Separation Rate~…it is important to note the strong cyclical comovement in the separation rates of different groups. This comovement emerges more clearly when job flows are graphed standardized, so that each series has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
172~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Job-Separation Rate~…standardizing the separation rates shows in particular that even though high-skill workers suffer fewer separations during recessions than other workers, their separations cyclically rise and fall along with those of everyone else.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…a common procedure to assess both common and idiosyncratic movements in a set of time series.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…this nonparametric procedure models common variation in a system of variables as arising from a set of common factors, to which the individual series are related by so-called factor loadings.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…the outcome variable is either the unemployment rate or a job flow rate for a particular industry-skill group in a specific quarter; left-hand side variables include factors that are common to all five groups and the group-specific loadings.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Common Factors~…represents the factors that are common to all five groups.
172~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Group-Specific Loadings~…depicts the group-specific factor loadings.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Common Factors~…these factors are identified by imposing orthogonality among the factors, then ording the factors sequentially by how much variance they can explain.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…the first common factor and its according group-specific factor loading are constructed to explain the maximum amount of total variation among the five individual rates. Then the second factor and its associated factor loadings are constructed to explain the maximal amount of remaining variance, and so on for all five factors. Because there are five industry-skill classes, five factors will explain all of the variance in each system of labor-market data and thus will completely characterize each individual unemployment rate or job flow.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…one limition of this estimation method is that the individual component series being modeled should have variances of similar sizes, so it is common to perform PCA on standardized series. If this standardization is not performed and the variances of the component series differ greatly, then the first factor will be unduly influenced by the series with the largest variance. This limits the usefulness of the PCA as a characterization of common variance across all component series.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…there is no error term in this equation because this decomposition includes all five factors. Also, while the construction of the factors have been described sequentially, in practice the factors are estimated simultaneously through an eigenvalue decomposition of the system's covariance matrix.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Common Factors~…factors are estimated simultaneously through an eigenvalue decomposition of the system's covariance matrix.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…seasonal adjustments are made to the component series before estimating the PCA. Regarding the individual variances, PCA works well when individual component variables have the same variances, but that variance does not have to equal one. Normalizing the component series to have unit variance is a common choice, however, and is equivalent to performing a PCA on the correlation matrix of the variables rather than the covariance matrix. 
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…this estimation method is used to analyze unemployment rates, job-finding rates, and job-separation rates.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Common Factors~…because there are five industry-skill groups in each PCA, the fifth common factor shows that the total variance explained by using all five factors equals 1.00.
172~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Standardized Unemployment and First Common Factor, Factor loadings, and Total Variance in PCA Systems~…among standardized unemployment rates, the first factor and its associated factor loadings explain 90.2% of the total variance in the PCA calculated system.
172~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Individual Job Flows and First Common Fact, Factor Loadings, and PCA Systems~…when analyzing the individual job flows, the first factor and its associated factor loadings explain 86.4% of  the total variance in the PCA calculated system, a number that confirms the pattern suggested in visual graphs of the results: the job-finding rates of the different industry-skill groups move together closely over the cycle. One job-separation rates are standardized, a single factor explains 66.9% of their total variance - a smaller, but still substantial, amount.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…PCA can also be used to study idiosyncratic variatio in component series.
172~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Actual vs. Predicted Job-Finding Rates~…the actual and predicted finding rates for high-skill workers line up closely, as would be expected given the high degree of total variance in finding rates explained by only one factor. But the predicted high-skill finding rate dips below the actual finding rate for an extended period in the early 2000s. Additionally, the predicted high-skill separation rate lies below the actual rate during the last tow business cycles. In other words, relative to their experiences in previous business cycles, high-skill workers experienced job-finding rates that were lower than expected in the early 2000s, while they experienced separation rates that were higher than expected during the two most recent business cycles.
172~D1, D2~F8~Findings~PCA and Idiosyncratic Movements for High-Skill Workers~…the full results of the PCA indicates that the pattern of idiosyncratic movements for high-skill workers is essentially the opposite of the pattern experienced by low-skill workers, who enjoy higher-than-normal finding rates during the early 2000s and lower-than-normal separation rates during the two most recent recessions.
172~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Principal Components Analysis~…PCA is often used to characterize comovement in different series, but the need to standardize the data beforehand means that the variances that a PCA attempts to estimate are in some sense artificial.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…researchers estimate dynamic factor models, which do not require pre-standardization, in order to overcome the limitations of principal components analysis.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…this model generates a latent factor (or factors) to drive common variation in the system. The model in this research has one common factor that depends on quarter-specific indexes.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…the unobserved common factor in this model is constrained to be an AR(1) process by the state equation, while the individual rates are determined by the so-called observation equations, the functional form of which resembles ordinary least-squares.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…the observation equations include the common factor, the group-specific constants, and seasonal coefficients. The component series therefore have their own means and seasonal cycles, though these series are partly determined by common variation. In this system, after accounting for common and seasonal variation, all remaining variation is absorbed by the error term. This error is assumed to be normally distributed. This normality assumption allows joint estimation of the system as a state-space model via maximum likelihood and the Kalman filter.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Common Factors~…a single common factor is included in dynamic factor model equations.
172~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Group-Specific Constants~…a series of constants that are attributable to each of the five separate occupation-specific skill groups.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Seasonal Coefficients~…a series of seasonal effects to account for seasonal variation in analyzing employment trends by occupation-specific skill groups.
172~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Common Factors for Flow Rate Systems and Autocorrelation~…the common factors for both flow rate systems are strongly autocorrelated, with estimated AR(1) coefficients above 0.90 in both bases.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…independent variables can be entered as right-hand-side variables in the state equation. These additions are especially useful in forecasting applications.
172~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Dynamic Factor Model Analysis and Occupation Group Constants~…all but the middle-construction constant terms are estimated to be close to 0.25 in the dynamic factor model analysis.
172~D1, D2~F11~Findings~The Common Factor and Job-Finding Rates~…the common factor has a similar effect on the finding rates of all industry-skill groups, with the relevant coefficients clustered in a tight range of 0.010 to 0.014.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~F12~Findings~Finding-Rate Dynamic Factor Model and Job-Finding Rates for Middle-Skill Workers~…the finding-rate DFM does a particular good job of explaining finding rates for middle-skill workers. The R-squared of the observation equation for middle-other workers is 0.95, while those for middle-construction and middle-manufacturing workers are both 0.96. However, the R-squared for both the high- and low-skill workers are only marginally lower (0.83).
172~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Dynamic Factor Model Analysis and Constant Terms~…the constant terms in the separation DFM analysis range from a low of 0.565 for high-skill workers to almost 10 times that for middle-construction workers.
172~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Job-Separation Rates and Common Factor Coefficients by Occupation Group~…the varying scale of separations across groups is also reflected in the large dispersion among common factor coefficients, ranging from 0.016 for the high-skill group to 0.379 for middle-construction.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~F15~Findings~Separation-Rate Dynamic Factor Model and Middle-Construction Workers~…the separation DFM does a better job fitting the data for middle-construction workers than for other workers. The R-squared for the middle-construction equation is 0.88, though all other R-squares in the model are close to 0.50 or larger. The relatively good fit for middle-construction may reflect a strong cyclical component for separations in that industry-skill group, relative to the importance of idiosyncratic variation.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…coefficient estimates in the observation equations of the separation DFM have been multiplied by 100 for notational convenience.
172~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Inverse Relationship Between Finding and Separation Rate Errors~…there exists a general inverse relationship in both finding and separation errors for middle-skill workers in manufacturing and construction. The 2000s saw middle-manufacturing workers lose jobs at higher than normal rates, while similarly skilled construction workers experienced fewer than expected separations. The opposite is true for job-finding rates, which were relatively low for manufacturing workers and high for construction workers during the same period. This manufacturing-construction dichotomy highlights the importance of accounting for industry effects when investigating the interaction between polarization and the business cycle, perhaps encouraging researchers to put more weight on the results for middle-skill workers outside of the two cyclical groups.
172~D2~F17~Findings~Construction Employment During the 1991 Recession~…Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that the four-quarter change in overall construction employment was -9.5% in 1991:Q3. This four-quarter rate of decline is larger than any four-quarter decline experienced during the recessions of the early 1980s.
172~D1, D2~F18~Findings~High-Skill Finding Rates After the 2001 Recession~…high-skill finding rates are abnormally low after the 2001 recession and separations are elevated after the two most recent recessions. These patterns are generally the reverse of the pattern for low-skill workers.
172~D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~VU Ratio~…the ratio of total job vacancies to total unemployment.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Dynamic Factor Models~…this model does not take into account the size of the individual industry-skill classes, so the common factors they generate are influenced by the classification scheme that the researchers choose.
172~D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~VU Ratio~…a close relationship between the rate of hiring in the economy and the VU ratio - a relationship sometimes called the hiring function - is clearly implied by theory and has been demonstrated in previous empirical work using aggregate data.
172~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Job-Finding Rate~…a close relationship between the rate of hiring in the economy and the VU ratio - a relationship sometimes called the hiring function - is clearly implied by theory and has been demonstrated in previous empirical work using aggregate data.
172~D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~VU Ratio~…to construct the VU ratio, researchers use the vacancy series produced in Barnichon (2010), which spans the post-1995 decline in newspaper help-wanted advertising (the basis for the traditional vacancy series that started in the early 1950s) as well as the introduction of the BLS's Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey in December 2000.
172~D3~D3~Dataset~Help-Wanted Advertising~…researchers draw a vacancy series from that produced in Barnichon (2010), which spans the post-1995 decline in newspaper help-wanted advertising (the basis for the traditional vacancy series that started in the early 1950s).
172~D4~D4~Dataset~JOLTS~…researchers draw a vacancy series from that produced in Barnichon (2010), which spans the introduction of the BLS's Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey in December 2000.
172~D4~T6~Time Period~2000-2011~…survey period from which Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey data is drawn.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M5~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to relate the finding rate to the VU ratio, researchers regress the common finding factor on the VU ratio and a constant. Then, the fitted values and out-of-sample forecasts from this regression are graphed, along with the actual values of the finding rate. A close fit would indicate that the classification system is reasonable and that the VU ratio explains economy wide hiring rates well. A divergence would suggest either that the classification system is inappropriate, or that the hiring function has broken down for reasons unrelated to polarization.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~F19~Findings~VU Ratio and the Common Finding Rate Over the Relevant Period~…the relationship between the VU ratio and the common finding rate is remarkably stable until the onset of the most recent recession (i.e. the Great Recession). Both regression-based predictions for the finding rate are close to one another, even though the two predictions are generated from samples of very different lengths. This closeness indicates that the relationship between the common finding rate and the VU ratio does not change much between the end of the first sample (1985:Q4) and the end of the second sample (2007:Q3). When the Great Recession begins, however, both of regression-based predictions imply that hiring should be much higher than it actually is.
172~D3~D3~Dataset~Help-Wanted Advertising~…Barnichon (2010) augments the traditional help-wanted data beginning in January 1995 with data from a concurrent survey of online help-wanted ads. Researchers use the traditional newspaper-based vacancy series from January 1976 to December 1994, then use Barnichon's composite series until December 2000. This method gives a consistent series of vacancies, in levels, throughout the sample period.
172~D3~T7~Time Period~1976-2000~…survey period from January 1976 to December 2000 during which the traditional newspaper-based vacancy series is collected from 1976 to 1994 and then Barnichon's composite series is collected until 2000, at which point the official vacancy series from the JOLTS program becomes available.
172~D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~VU Ratio~…for the denominator of the VU ratio, researchers use the reported number of unemployed persons from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~F20~Findings~Average Finding Rate and the VU Ratio During and After the Great Recession~…the average finding rate indicated by the model-based common finding rate is closely related to the VU ratio before 2007:Q3; however, the recent discrepancy between job-finding rates and vacancies suggests that the hiring environment has undergone a pronounced adverse change, a finding that is consistent with the recent outward shift in the Beveridge curve.
172~D1~V5~Variable~Composition of Outflows~…the composition of outflows from unemployment for each of the five industry-skill groups.
172~D1~V5~Variable~Composition of Outflows~…these outflows are taken from the Current Population Survey data with no demographic adjustments.
172~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…outflows from unemployment for each of the five industry-skill groups are taken from the Current Population Survey data with no demographic adjustments.
172~D1, D2~F21~Findings~Middle-Skill Workers and Middle-Skill Transitions~…middle-manufacturing workers leaving unemployment take middle-skill jobs more than 75% of the time, while the corresponding percentage for middle-construction workers is even higher. Additionaly, the probability of skill-switching for middle-skill workers appears particularly immune to business cycle fluctuations. Combined with the high percentage of middle-skill workers who stay in middle-skill work, the lack of cyclical variation in skill-switching for the middle-skill unemployed suggests that it is unattractive or infeasible for unemployed middle-skill workers to find high-skill or low-skill jobs at any phase of the business cycle.
172~V5~L9~Variable Value~New Job~…depicts the transitions of workers who leave unemployment for a new job, either high-skill, low-skill, or middle-skill.
172~V5~L10~Variable Value~Nonparticipation~…indicates a transition out of unemployment toward nonparticipation.
172~V5~L10~Variable Value~Nonparticipation~…as the labor force ages, a higher share of the unemployed may choose to retire early by moving from unemployment to nonparticipation.
172~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Composition of Outflows Over the Relevant Period~…estimates show that in the second half of the sample, a progressively higher share of workers who exit unemployment do so by leaving the labor force. This rising share of U-to-N exits, combined with the cyclicality of this share in the latter part of the sample period, suggests that a study of long-run labor-market trends and cyclical reallocation should incorporate the potential exit for unemployed workers to nonparticipation.
172~D1~V5~Variable~Composition of Outflows~…a worker can exit from unemployment in one of two ways: leaving the labor force or finding a job. Consequently, when the job-finding rate falls, the probability of moving from U-to-N conditional on exiting unemployment is likely to rise simply because the probability of exiting unemployment in the only other possible way has declined.
172~D2~D2~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics~…source of data on gross worker flows.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-N~…the unconditional probability of moving from unemployment to nonparticipation is the ratio of U-to-N movements to the total number of unemployed workers in the previous month.
172~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-N and the Job-Finding Rate Collapse~…even though the top panel shows that the share of unemployment spells that end in nonparticipation its near its post-1976 high, the bottom panel shows that the unconditional probability of moving from U-to-N is near a 20-year-low. These two facts are explained, of course, by the recent collapse in the overall job-finding rate.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…researchers estimate multinomial logit models that ask how the undconditional transition probabilities change in response to the economy's overall job-finding rate, controlling ror worker-level demographic characteristics (which may be relevant for trends as well as the cycle) as well as unemployment duration.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-E~…the unconditional probability of moving from unemployment to employment is the ratio of U-to-E movements to the total number of unemployed workers in the previous month.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-E~…with staying in unemployment is normalized as the baseline choice, the unconditional probabilities of transitioning from unemployment to either E or N are logit-based regressions dependent on a vector of regressors and parameters. For notational convenience, this representation does not distinguish between exits to high-skill, middle-skill, or low-skill employment, but this breakdown is made in the empirical work.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-N~…with staying in unemployment is normalized as the baseline choice, the unconditional probabilities of transitioning from unemployment to either E or N are logit-based regressions dependent on a vector of regressors and parameters. For notational convenience, this representation does not distinguish between exits to high-skill, middle-skill, or low-skill employment, but this breakdown is made in the empirical work.
172~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Worker Attributes~…to capture worker-level attributes, this individual characteristic vector includes data on educational attainment, gender, marital status, and age.
172~D1~V6~Variable~Unemployment Duration~…reported unemployment duration is also entered as a set of dymmy variables, with the omitted dummy corresponding to workers who have zero to one weeks of unemployment duration.
172~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Common Factors~…to caputre the state of the business cycle, researchers include the common factor from the finding-rate DFM.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…to caputre the state of the business cycle, researchers include the common factor from the finding-rate DFM.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-E~…for all unemployed workers except the high-skilled, researchers report transition probabilities for a baseline worker who is 35 years old, male, unmarried, and white, and who has a high school diploma but no further education.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-N~…for all unemployed workers except the high-skilled, researchers report transition probabilities for a baseline worker who is 35 years old, male, unmarried, and white, and who has a high school diploma but no further education.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-E~…for the high-skilled probabilities, researchers construct a baseline worker with a college degree.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-N~…for the high-skilled probabilities, researchers construct a baseline worker with a college degree.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…for each of the five types of unemployed workers, researchers run two multinomial logits, one on a sample from 1976:Q1-1985:Q4 and another on a sample from 1986:Q1-2012:Q1.
172~V5~L10~Variable Value~Nonparticipation~…flows between unemployment and nonparticipation are known to be measured with error.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the main purpose of the multinomial logit regressions is rto see whetrher the transition decisions change over time. If the nature of measurement error has remained constant, it would not be immediate clear how errors in reporting U-to-N transitions would affect the results.
172~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Worker Attributes~…researchers enter a post-1994 dummy in the worker attribute vector where appropriate.
172~D1~V7~Variable~Post-1994~…researchers enter a post-1994 dummy in the worker attribute vector where appropriate. This dummy controls for any level shift in the probabilities after the Current Population Survey redesign, including the upward shift in the unconditional U-to-N probability that appears after the redesign.

172~D1, D2~F24~Findings~Middle-Skill Workers and the Job-Finding Rate~…middle-skill workers are less likely to exit unemployment for middle-skill jobs when the finding rate falls. A drop in the overall finding rate has little effect on the probability that a baseline middle-skill worker will find a job in another skill class, as these probabilities are low to begin with. Because the unconditional probabilities must sum to one, the lack of a cyclical response for most potential exits means that the decline in middle-skill re-employment probabilities caused by a drop in the overall job-finding rate is reflected nearly one-for-one by an increase in the probability that a middle-skill worker remains unemployed.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methdology~Multinomial Logit~…for comparison purposes, researchers also estimate multinomial transition logits for unemployed high- and low-skill workers.
172~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Unconditional Probability of Moving from U-to-E~…these probabilities correspond to a 35-year-old baseline worker with a high-school degree, and choosing another baseline worker would affect the likelihood of a middle-skill transition out of unemployment into a low-skill or high-skill job. Setting the baseline equal to an average worker would still generate few transitions to high- or low-skill jobs.
172~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…in this paper, researchers match workers only across consecutive months in the Current Population Survey, and nonparticipating Current Population Survey respondents are not asked questions about their most recent occupations. Consequently, researchers are unable to determine whether ""middle-skill nonparticipators"" are more likely to emerge from nonparticipation with higher-skill jobs, as would be expected if these workers chose to use their time out of the labor market to agument their skills. They did, however, investigate outflows from nonparticipation over the sample period disaggregated by gender."
172~D1, D2~F25~Findings~Multinomial Logit Regression Results~…taken together, the results of the multinomial logits suggest that the rising and increasingly cyclical share of exits from unemployment to nonparticipation does not result from middle-skill workers - or any type of worker, for that matter - choosing to transition to nonparticipation as an optimal response to lower job-finding rates. Rather, the time-series behavior of reallocations of unemployed workers to nonparticipation seems driven by a combination of demographic influences and the simple mechanical effect of being unable to exit unemployment by finding a job.
172~D1, D2~T8~Time Period~2009-2011~…survey period from which the worst employment growth was experienced by middle-skill workers, the same group that has been adversely affected by long-term polarization trends in the United States labor market.
172~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…after the recession, the economy's unemployment rate remains high for an extended period, as large numbers of former routine workers endure long unemployment spells in the swtiching market where jobs are hard to find.
172~D1, D2~F26~Findings~High-Skill Separations and the Business Cycle~…high-skill separations are cyclical in nature and during the jobless recoveries from the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions, the high-skill separation rate was high relative to its historical norm. As for job-finding rates, these flows are similar across industry-skill groups throughout the sample period, though they were particularly low for high-skill workers in the early 2000s. These findings do not necessarily rule out a role for polarization in generating recoveries, but the do suggest that the factors linking polarization to jobless recoveries extend beyond job-matching frictions.

173~D1, D3, D5~F20~Findings~Average Annual Earnings Relative to College Type~…in 1975, the average annual earnings of a male 18-24-yearold high school graduate working full year and full time was $20,845 (1991 dollars), where in contrast, the average tuition was $701, and the average tution at public four-year institutions was $1,172, suggesting that the full cost of a year of full-time study is quite similar at the two types of institutions, despite the differences in tuition levels.
173~D1, D2, D3~F21~Findings~Opportunity Costs~…using estimated costs, if an individual completes only one semester of schooling, or 13 weeks, the cost of college is roughly $5,211 in forgone earnings and $351 in tuition, thus, the increased earnings for the two-year college student need only compensate the individual for this difference, the the margin.

173~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972~…a credit at a school on the quarter system was considered at two-thirds the weight of a semester credit using a rule of thumb suggested by the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, where students were given 2 credits for courses for which no number of credit hours was recorded but for which they had passing grades, and 2 credits for courses with neither credits nor grades recorded.
173~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972~…failed courses or courses with alphanumeric course grades indicating incomplete, withdrawn, or unsatisfactory were not counted in the total credits and courses accompanied by credits but no grades were counted as having been passed; the maximum number of credits alowed er course was 12, and transfer courses were not double-counted.

174~174: Layoffs and Lemons~~~~
174~Parent Object~Label~Tag ~Value~Context
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…evidence on displaced workers from Current Population Surveys supports all three of the researchers' model's predictions.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in this article theoretical and empirical analyses of an asymmetric-information model of layoffs is provided. 
174~D1~V1~Derived Variable~Wages~…the main idea behind the article is simple. If a firm has discretion over who to lay off, then the firm's desire to retain a worker signals to the market that the worker is of high ability, so the market bids up the wage of retained workers. As a result, the firm finds it unprofitable to retain low-ability workers and hence lays them off. The market then infers that the laid-off workers are of low ability and so offers them low wages in their next jobs.
174~D1~V1~Derived Variable~Wages~…one might asky why high- and low-ability workers cannot be retained at high and low wages, respectively. As will become clear, the answer is that, if the firm could retain low-ability workers at a low wage, then it could also retain high-ability workers at this low wage, thereby destroying the market's willingness to allow any workers to be retained at the low wage.
174~D1~V1~Derived Variable~Wages~…researchers assume that workers displaced by plant closings suffer from no adverse inference and so receive (relatively) higher reemployment wages from the market.
174~D1~V1~Derived Variable~Wages~…the current model predicts that the postdisplacement wages of (otherwise observationally equivalent) workers will differ according to the cause of displacement. Furthermore, in the current model it is the layoff event that signals unfavorable information to the market, so the model predicts that the predisplacement wages of (otherwise observationally equivalent) workers will not differ according to the cause of displacement. Combining these predictions, researchers have that the wage loss at displacement should be larger those laid off than for those displaced by plant closings.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the empirical work, researchers use data from the Displaced Workers Supplement in the January 1984 and 1986 Current Population Surveys. Because the current model assumes that the firm has discretion over whom to lay off, researchers focus on white-collar workers (rather than on blue-collar workers, whose jobs often are covered by collective-bargaining agreements involving explicit layoff-by-senioirty rules).
174~D1~F1~Findings~Wage Loss from Layoff Relative to Plant Closing Displacement for White-Collar Workers~…in the current CPS sample, the estimated mean percentage wage loss from displacement is 5.5 percentage points greater for white-collar workers displaced by layoffs than for (otherwise observationally equivalent) white-collar workers displaced by plant closings. 
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in interpreting the empirical results, it is worth noting that they do not control for a potentially important effect in the opposite direction: if a plant is large compared to its local labor market, then the increase in the local unemployment rate following a plant closing seems likely both to depress the reemployment wages and to extend the typical unemployment duration of dispaced workers.
174~D1~V1~Derived Variable~Wages~…in the signaling equilibria, a firm lays off its least productive workers. Prospective employers then infer that these workers are of low productivity and so offer them a low wage. Researchers assume that no such negative inference is warranted after a plant closing, so the average reemployment wage of workers who lose their jobs because of a plant closing is higher than that of workers who lose their jobs because of a layoff.
174~D1~V2~Variable~Period~…the current model has two periods.
174~V2~L12~Variable Value~Period 1~…the initial period in the model in which the respondents of interest are employed at a certain wage.
174~V2~L13~Variable Value~Period 2~…the secondary period in the model in which the respondent's current employment and wage offer is contingent on the variables in the model.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~...the major elements of the model are (1) the production technology, (2) the information structure, (3) the commitment and contracting possiblities, and (4) the timing of events between periods 1 and 2.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…Production Technology: the first-period output of a worker of (time-invariant) productive ability n is y(1)(n) = n. The second-period output of a worker of ability n is y(2)(n) = n + s if the worker remains with the first-period employer but is y(2)(n) = n if the worker changes employers. The parameter s can be interpreted as firm-specific human capital and/or as one (or even the sum) of the following transaction costs: a mobility cost incurred by the worker, a hiring cost incurred by a new employer, or a firing cost incurred by the first-period employer. Given the range of these possible interpretations of s, it is difficult to specify how one might measure s. Nonetheless, it seems plausible to researchers that in many employment relationships at least one of these potential interpretations of s is an important consideration.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…Information Structure: at the beginning of the first period, information is symmetric but imperfect: based on the observable characteristics of a given worker, all firms and the worker share the belief that the worker's productive ability is distributed according to the probability distribution F(n) on (n(L), n(H)) with density f(n). At the end of the first period, the worker's current employer (hereafter also called the firm) observes the worker's first-period output and so perfectly infers the worker's ability, but prospective employers (hereafter also called the market) do not observe output and so do not (yet) update their beliefs about the worker's ability. Finally to keep things simple, researchers make assumptions below (on the kinds of wage and employment contracts that are feasible) to guarantee that it is immaterial whether or not the worker observes first-period output.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…Information Structure: in the interest of clarity, researchers impose a (rather weak) regularity condition on the distribution of productive ability: f(n) must be log concave (i.e. ln f(n) must be concave in n), which implies that d{E(n|n>= x)}/dx <= 1 for every x. Many familiar distributions - including the uniform, Normal, exponential, and beta distributions -satisfy this condition. Furthermore, the truncation of a log-concave distribution is log concave. Researchers also impose an assumption relating the importance of firm-specific capital and the distribution of ability. As will become clear, the model is trivial without this assumption because a first-period employer can afford to retain even the lowest-ability worker for the second period, even if prospective employers offer a wage equal to the expected ability of the entire population of workers.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…Commitment and Contracting Possibilities: researchers assume that neither contingent nor long-term contracts are possible: the first-period wage is determined at the beginning of the first period, the second-period wage is determined at the beginning of the second period, and the layoff decision is made at the beginning of the second period. The firm cannot commit at the beginning of the first period to pay a particular second-period wage or to make a particular second-period layoff decision, whether or not the wage or layoff decision is contingent on first-period output. Once the second period arrives, however, the firm chooses to pay wages and make layoff decisions that depend on output (i.e. ability). Since there are no contingent or long-term contracts, firms have no way to offer insurance, so it is immaterial whether workers are risk neutral or risk averse. 
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~...Commitment and Contracting Possibilities: the assumption that contracts contingent on output cannot be enforced fits naturally with the assumption that output is not observable by prospective employers (and so plausibly also is unobservable to court). The assumption that long-term contracts cannot be enforced seems natural because of the possiblity that firm-specific productivity shocks may occur: if a bad enough shock occurs at the beginning of period 2, the current employer will go bankrupt rather than live up to the contract. More generally, both of these assumptions are in keeping with the view that output and compensation are complex, multidimensional quantities that are difficult to specify in a contract: output can be produced under favorable or unfavorable circumstances and can be of high or low quality; compensation includes not only wages but working conditions and task assignments.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…Timing of Events: the crux of the model is the sequence of events between the two periods. After observing a given worker's first-period output, the current employer decides whether to lay off the worker. If the worker is laid off, then the current employer has no further contract with the worker. In particular, there is no possiblity of recall. Following a layoff, prospective employers observe that the worker was laid off and then simultaneously offer the worker a second-period wage. The worker acepts the highest wage offered (randomizing in case of a tie). If the current employer does not lay off the worker, however, then the following wage-setting game ensues. First, prospective employers observe that the worker was not laid off by the first-period employer. Second, prospective employers simulatenously offer the worker a second-period wage. Third, the current employer observes the offers from prospective employers and then makes its own second period wage offer to the worker. Finally, the worker chooses the highest of the wages offered (choosing the current employer's offer in case of a tie), except  that with probability [mu] the worker is constrained to move - in order to accompany a spouse, for example - and so accepts the highest offer from the market (randomizing among tied offers).
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the model of layoffs and wage-setting integrates two leading models from the literature: the adverse-selection model developed by Greenwald and the signaling model developed by Waldman. There are two major differences between these models. First, Greenwald assumes that the market's second-period wage offer to a worker the firm does not lay off equals the worker's expected ability conditional on the worker choosing to accept the market's offer rather than the firm's. Waldman, in contrast, assumes that the market's offer is the (unconditional) expectation of the worker's ability. In the terminology of auction theory Greenwald allows for the winner's curse, while Waldman assumes it away. Second, Greenwald assumes that the firm has no opportunity to signal its private information, whereas Waldman does allow the firm to signal (through job assignments rather than through layoffs as here).
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the current model has a continuum of equilibria, ranging from an equilibrium analogous to the unique equilibrium in Greenwald's model to an equilibrium analogous to the unique equilibrium in Waldman's model. All of these equilibria formalize the intuition that if the firm lays off any one at all, it lays off its least productive workers; the market infers that laid-off  workers are of low productivity and so offers them a low wage; assuming that no such negative inference is warranted after a plant closing, laid-off workers thus earn lower reemployment wages than do workers displaced by plant closings.
174~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Output~…as a proxy for ability.
174~DV2~L1~Variable Value~First Period Output~…the first-period output of a worker of (time-invariant) productive ability n is y(1)(n) = n.
174~DV2~L2~Variable Value~Second Period Output~…the second-period output of a worker of ability n is y(2)(n) = n + s (where s > 0) if the worker remains with the first-period employer but is y(2)(n) = n if the worker changes employers.
174~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Human Capital/Transaction Costs~…the parameter s can be interpreted as firm-specific human capital and /or as one (or even the sum) of the following transaction costs: a mobility cost incurred by the worker, a hiring cost incurred by a new employer, or a firing cost incrrued by the first-period employer.
174~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Human Capital/Transaction Costs~…given the range of the possible interpretations of s, it is difficult to specify how one might measure s. Nonetheless, it seems plausible that in many employment relationships at least one of these potential interpretations of s is an important considerations.

174~D1~V6~Variable~Layoff Decision~…once the second period arrives, the firm choose to pay wages and make layoff decisions that depend on output.
174~D1~V1~Variable~Wages~…the assumption that contracts contingent on output cannot be enforced fits naturally with the assumption that output is not observable by prospective employers (and so plausibly also is unobservable to court).

174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…in constructing an equilibrium in the current model, the secondary step is to compute the market's optimal wage offer to a worker who was not laid off, given that the firm's subsequent offer will be the best response just derived and given the market's conjecture about the layoff rule used by the firm.
174~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Layoff Rule~…in constructing an equilibrium in the current model, the third step is to compute the firm's optimal layoff rule, given that the subsequent wage offers will be the best responses just derived. In equilibrium, the firm's chosen layoff rule must be identical to the market's conjecture.
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…let w(m) denote the worker's best offer from the market (hereafter also called the market wage); w(m) = max {w(m1)[R], w(m2)[R]}.
174~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Firm Wage Offer~…if the worker's ability satisfies n + s >= w(m), the firm's best response is to try to retain the worker by offering the market wage, in which case the worker remains with the firm for the second period with probability 1 - [mu] but is constrained to move with probability [mu].
174~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Probability of Move~…if the worker's ability satisfies n + s >= w(m), the firm's best response is to try to retain the worker by offering the market wage, in which case the worker remains with the firm for the second period with probability 1 - [mu] but is constrained to move with probability [mu].
174~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Firm Wage Offer~…if the worker's ability satisfies n + s < w(m), however, the firm's best response is to offer less than the market wage, in which case with probability one the worker leaves the firm to accept a higher second-period wage offer from a new employee.
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…in equilibrium, prospective employers anticipate that the firm will play the best response just derived. In order to compute their optimal wage offers, prospective employers must also have a conjecture about the layoff rule used by the firm. Suppose that prospective employers believe that the firm lays off a worker if and only if the worker's ability is less than some cutoff, n(R). Then Bertrand wage competition among prospective employers bids up the second-period wage the market offers to workers who are not laid off until the market earns zero expected profit on the workers it attracts with this offer.
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…prospective employers understand that with probability [mu] the worker will be constrained to move and so will accept w(m) independent of the offer received from the firm but that with probability 1 - [mu] the worker will not be constrained to move and so will accept w(m) only if it exceeds the wage offer received from the firm (i.e., only if n < w(m) - s, given the firm's best response derived).
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…for each of the relevant values of n[R], equation (1) (i.e. the equation used to solve the optimal market wage) has a unique solution.
174~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Layoff Rule~…in equilibrium, the firm anticipates that the subsequent market wage offer will be w(m), the solution to (1), and so understands that it will find it unprofitable to employer a worker of ability satisfying n + s < w(m). The firm is indifferent between the two ways it can rid itself of such a worker: it can lay off the worker, or it can induce the worker to quit by offering less than the market wage. Thus, provided that n[R] + s <= w(m), one of the firm's optimal layoff rules is to layoff a worker if n < n(R) and to induce the worker to quit if n[R] <= n < w(m) - s. If the firm chooses this rule then the market's conjucture researchers assume is correct.
174~DV2~L6~Variable Value~Retain Ability~…suppose that prospective employers believe that the firm lays off a worker if and only if the worker's ability is less than some cutoff, n[R].
174~DV2~L6~Variable Value~Retain Ability~…an equilibrium in the current model is constructed, provided n[R] satisfies n[R] + s <= w(m) where in w(m) is in turn a function of n[R]. This equality holds provided that n[R] <= n*, where n* is the unique solution to n* + s = E(n|n >= n*).
174~DV2~L7~Variable Value~n*~…n* is the unique solution to n* + s = E(n|n >= n*). Equation (3).
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…w(m) is a function of n[R] as described by (1).
174~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Layoff Wage Offer~…to complete the description of equilibrium, it remains only to specify the equilibrium behavior by prospective employers if the firm lays off a worker: Bertrand wage competition yields a second-period wage equal to the worker's expected ability. If prospective employers believe that the firm lays off a worker if and only if the worker's ability is less than n[R], then the reemployment wage of a laid-off worker will be w(2)(L) = E(n|n < n[R]). Since n[R] < n* < n(H), it is had that w(2)(L) < E(n). Equation (4). For workers who lose their jobs because of a plant closing, researchers assume that no adverse inference about ability is warranted, so that competition among prospective employers yields the reemployment wage w(2)(PC) = E(n). Equation (5).
174~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Layoff Wage Offer~…comparing (4) and (5) shows that w(2)(PC) > w(2)(L). This inequality is the main prediction of the current model: the reemployment wages of laid-off workers are less than those of (otherwise observationally equivalent) workers displaced by plant closings.
174~V1~L3~Variable Value~First-Period Wage~…in the current model, competition among employers and the symmetric information before period 1 yield a single first-period wage w(1) for all workers, independent of ability.
174~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Wage Changes~…in the current model, competition among employers and the symmetric information before period 1 yield a single first-period wage w(1) for all workers, independent of ability. Therefore, the wage changes experienced by displaced workers satisfy w(2)(PC) - w(1) > w(2)(L) - w(1).
174~DV2~L7~Variable Value~n*~…n* in (3) decreases with s. In the limits n* approaches n(L) as s approaches E(n) - n(L) and approaches n(H) as s approaches zero. These results follow from the fact that the current employer considers the productivity (in that firm) of the marginal retained worker, while prospective employers consider the productivity (in their firms) of the average retained worker. Some level of firm-specific human capital (s>0) is necessary for theses two productivities to be equal.
174~DV2~L8~Variable Value~Layoff Ability~…a level of output (i.e. ability) that constitutes layoff from a specific firm.
174~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Human Capital/Transaction Costs~…some level of firm-specific human capital (s > 0) is necessary for the marginal retained worker productivity and the average retained worker productivity to be equal.
174~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Output~…n(L) and n* are independent of [mu].
174~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Layoff Rates~…n(L) and n* are independent of [mu]. Thus, the range of layoff rates associated with the continuum of equilibria (i.e., F(n[R]), for n[R] ranging from n(L) to n*) is independent of [mu]. 
174~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Quit Rates~…n(L) and n* are independent of [mu]. The range of quit rates associated with these equilibria does vary with [mu], however, and also varies inversely with the layoff rate: the maximal quit rate occurs when the layoff rate is zero (i.e., when n[R] = n(L)) and the minimal quit rate (namely, [mu]) occurs when the layoff rate is maximal (i.e. when n[R] = n*).
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…the higher the ability of the most able laid-off worker (namely, n[R]), the weaker the winner's curse the market suffers when it makes a second-period wage offer to a worker the firm does not lay off (in that sense that this wage offer becomes closer to the unconditional expectation of the worker's ability). One interpretation of these equilibria is that researchers relax Waldman's assumption that the winner's curse is absent but show that the assumption holds in one of the limiting equilibria (and is approximately correct in nearby equilibria). A second interpretation is that they could allow the ability distribution in Greenwald's model to be determined endogenously by the firm's layoff decision and show that even if [mu] is arbitrarily small (as casual reflection suggests it might be) there exist equilibria in which turnover does not vanish: the layoff rate can be as high as F(n*), independent of [mu]. Under either interpretation, however, the main resultwill be practically the same.
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~...the winner's curse arises in an auction when the good being sold has a common value to all the bidders (such as an oil field) and each bidder has a privately known unbiased estimate of the value of the good (such as from a geologist's report): the winning bidder will be the one who most overestimated the value of the good; this bidder's estimate itself may be unbiased but the estimate conditional on the knowledge that is the highest of n unbiased estimates is not. 
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…evidence on the wages of male dispalced workers is provided using data from the January 1984 and January 1986 Displaced Workers Supplement (DWS) to the Current Population Survey. Researchers examine  how the change in wages, the predisplacement wage, and the postdisplacement wage vary with the cause of displacement and with predisplacement occupation.
174~D1~T1~Time Period~1984-1986~…evidence on the wages of male dispalced workers is provided using data from the January 1984 and January 1986 Displaced Workers Supplement (DWS) to the Current Population Survey.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers focus on males dispalced from full-time jobs in an attempt to identify a sample of workers with strong attachments to the labor market. This allows them to focus on the impact of the lemons effect on wages alone rather than jointly modeling the impact on labor-force participation.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…workers in the January 1984 DWS permanently lost a job between January 1979 and January 1984. Workers in the January 1986 DWS permanently lost a job between January 1981 and January 1986. Individuals enter the DWS if they lost a job in the 5 years prior to the survey because of a plant closing, an employer going out of business, or a layoff from which he or she was not recalled. Interviewers for the DWS were instructed that, if an individual was fired from a job for cause, then the individual should not be included in the DWS. If a worker lost more than one job in the 5 years prior to the survey, the survey questions refer to the lost job he or she held the longest. See U.S. Deparment of Commerce (1986) for further details on the desing and implementation of the DWS surveys.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data used in the current research concerns layoffs and plant closings.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~...the model used in the current research concerns layoffs and plant closings.
174~V8~L9~Variable Value~Plant Closing~…a laid-off worker could claim to have been displaced by a plant closing. Researchers assume that plant closings are not only widely observed but also verifiable.
174~V8~L10~Variable Value~Quit~…a laid-off worker might try to escape the lemons inference described in the model by claiming to have quit rather than admit to having been laid off.
174~D1~V8~Variable~Reason For Displacement~…researchers assume that a personnel officer could check an applicant's claim concerning a plant closing. Likewise, it is assumed that a personnel officer could check an applicant's claim concerning current or previous employment.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers assume that a personnel officer could check an applicant's claim concerning a plant closing. Likewise, it is assumed that a personnel officer could check an applicant's claim concerning current or previous employment.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers examine a pooled sample of male workers between the ages of 20 and 61 who were permanently displaced from a private-sector, full-time, nonagricultural job because of a plant closing, slack work, or a position or shift that was eliminated; researchers classify as layoffs those displaced because of slack work or a position or shift that was eliminated. Workers displaced from construction jobs were eliminated from the sample since it is difficult to formulate an appropriate definition of permanent displacement from a construction job.
174~V8~L10~Variable Value~Quit~…this value is excluded from analysis as a worker who has quit has technically not been laid off.
174~V8~L11~Variable Value~Slack Work~…researchers classify as layoffs those displaced because of slack work.
174~V8~L12~Variable Value~Position or Shift Eliminated~…researchers classify as layoffs those displaced because of a position or shift that was eliminated.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…for most of the analysis, the sample is restricted to those individuals who were reemployed in wage and salary employment at the survey date and who had reemployment earnings of at least $40 a week. Potential sample-selection bias is exaimed arising from the fact that sample workers not reemployed at the survey date are excluded.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample is approximately evenly split between those displaced through plant closings and those displaced by layoffs. The vast majority (79%) of those whom researchers classify as displaced by layoffs were displaced because of slack work. 
174~D1~F2~Findings~Lemon Effect Identification~…the major measured difference between workers displaced by plant closings and those displaced by layoffs is that, on average, the former had been on their predisplacement jobs substantially longer (2.2 more years). This suggests that seniority rules may be important in layoff decisions. The earnings loss for the typical displaced worker in the sample is substantial. The mean change in the log of real weekly earnings is -0.16 for the whole sample and does not differ much between those displaced by plant closings and those displaced by layoffs. Thus, the fact that the earnings losses of workers displaced by layoffs and by plant closings are similar despite the higher average predisplacement tenure of those displaced by plant closings suggest that a lemon effect may be operating.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…unfortunately, the CPS does not provide current earnings information for those workers who entered self-employment.
174~D1~V9~Variable~Previous Tenure~…the length of tenure held at a CPS respondent's previous job.
174~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Change in Log Real Weekly Earnings~…the changes in log real weekly earnings for CPS respondents.
174~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Log of Previous Weekly Earnings~…the log of previous weekly earnings for CPS respondents.
174~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Log of Current Weekly Earnings~…the log of current weekly earnings for CPS respondents.
174~D1~V10~Variable~Weeks of Joblessness After Displacement~…the weeks of joblessness after displacement for CPS respondents.
174~D1~V11~Variable~No Unemployment After Displacement~…a binary variable equal to 1 if a CPS respondent was not unemployed after displacement.
174~D1~V12~Variable~Advance Notification of Displacement~…a binary variable equal to 1 if a CPS respondent received advance notification of displacement.
174~D1~V13~Variable~Education~…the years of schooling achieved by a CPS respondent.
174~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…age minus education minus 6 for a CPS respondent at displacement.
174~V16~L13~Variable Value~White Collar~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the CPS respondent's previous job was white collar.
174~D1~V15~Variable~Manufacturing~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the CPS respondent's previous job was in manufacturing.
174~D1~F3~Findings~Layoff vs. Plant Closings Displacement~…a measured difference between workers displaced by plant closings and those displaced by layoffs is that, on average, the former have shorter spells of joblessness following displacement, are more likely to have found new jobs without an intervening spell of unemployment, and are more likely to have received advance notification of job loss.
174~D1~V6~Variable~Layoff Decision~…the information content of a layoff depends on whether the employer has any discretion with respect to whom to lay off.
174~DV8~L14~Variable Value~Layoff-by-Seniority Rule~…in the presence of a layoff-by-seniority, there may be little or no information concerning a worker's ability revealed by the fact that the worker was laid off.
174~DV8~L14~Variable Value~Layoff-by-Seniority Rule~…most jobs covered by collective-bargaining agreements are governed by layoff-by-seniority rules, but many nonunion jobs are not governed by such rules.
174~D1~V16~Variable~Occupation~…because many fewer-white- than blue-collar jobs are covered by collective-bargaining agreements, researchers presume that the degree of discretion over whom to lay off is likely to be higher in white- than in blue-collar jobs.
174~D1~F4~Findings~Difference in Average Predisplacement Tenure Across Occupations~…the difference in average predisplacement tenure between workers displaced by plant closings and those displaced by layoffs is significantly smaller for white-collar workers than it is for blue-collar workers (1.3 vs. 2.6 years). This suggests that strict layoff-by-seniority rules are less important and employer discretion is more important for layoff decisions concerning white-collar workers than for those involving blue-collar workers. the significantly lower fraction of white- than of blue-collar layoff victims who received advance notification of displacement (0.41 vs. 0.51) also suggests that white-collar layoffs are less likely to be governed by collective-bargaining agreements, which often include formal prenotification requirements and formally limit employer choice with respect to whome to lay off.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…unfortunately, the Displaced Workers Supplements do not provide information on whether a worker's predisplacement job was covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers used all 12 outgoing rotation groups from the 1983 Current Population Survey to tabulate unionization rates by occupation for a sample of workers comparable to the relevant DWS sample. Included in the sample are 20- to 61-year-old, male, full-time, private-sector employees not working in agriculture or construction. Workers were classified as unionized if they were union members and/or working in employment covered by a collective-bargaining agreement. Researchers find that 10.4% of white-collar workers were unionized, compared to 38.5% of blue-collar workers.
174~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Difference in Tenure~…researchers compute the difference in average predisplacement tenure between workers displaced by plant closings and those displaced by layoffs for one-digit predisplacement occupations rather than for our white- and blue-collar occupational aggregates.
174~D1~F5~Findings~Difference in Tenure Across Detailed Occupation Categories~…among white-collar workers, the average difference in tenure (in years) is: managers and administrators = 1.4, professional and technical workers = 1.6, clerical workers = 1.2, and sales workers = 1.2. Among blue-collar workers, the average (in years) is: craft and kindred workers = 2.7, operatives (except in transportation) = 2.9, transport operatives = 2.2, laborers = 3.1, and service workers = 1.4. Thus, with the exception of service workers, the white= vs. and blue-collar division of the sample closely matches the division of the sample in terms of this average difference in predisplacement tenure.
174~V16~L13~Variable Value~White Collar~…the white-collar sample consits of workers with predisplacement jobs as managers and administrators, professional and technical workers, clerical workers, and sales workers.
174~V16~L15~Variable Value~Blue Collar~…the blue-collar sample consists of workers with predisplacement jobs as craft and kindred workers, operatives (except in transportation), transport operatives, laborers, and service workers.
174~D1~F6~Findings~Raw Earnings Losses Across Occupations for BothPre- and Postdisplacement Periods~…when looking at the pattern of (raw) earnings losses for white-collar workers fits the predictions of the model: predisplacement earnings do not differ much by cause of displacement, while postdisplacement earnings are significantly lower (by 6%) for those displaced by layoffs. Furthermore, for blue-collar workers the analogous difference in postdisplacement earnings is not significantly differnt from zero, again as predicted by the model.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the reported regressions include a spline function in previout tenure (with breaks at 1, 2, 3, and 6 years), education, a dummy for advance notification of displacement, year-of-displacement dummies, seven previous-industry dummies, eight previous-occupation dummies, experience (age-education-6) and its square, a marriage dummy, a nonwhite dummy, and three region dummies. Certain specifications (columns 1 and 3) also include years since displacement.
174~D1~V9~Variable~Previous Tenure~…earnings regressions include a spline function in previous tenure (with breaks at 1, 2, 3, and 6 years).
174~D1~V13~Variable~Education~…earnings regressions include education.
174~D1~V12~Variable~Advance Notification of Displacement~…earnings regressions include a dummy for advance notification of displacement.
174~D1~V17~Variable~Year-of-Displacement~…earnings regressions include year-of-displacement dummies.
174~D1~V18~Variable~Previous-Industry~…earnings regressions include sevon previous-industry dummies.
174~D1~V14~Variable~Previous-Occupation~…earnings regressions include eight previous-occupation dummies.
174~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…earnings regressions include experience (age - education - 6).
174~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Experience Squared~…earnings regressions include experience and its square.
174~D1~V19~Variable~Marriage~…earnings regressions include a marriage dummy.
174~D1~V20~Variable~Non-White~…earnings regressions include a nonwhite dummy.
174~D1~V21~Variable~Region~…earnings regressions include three region dummies.
174~DV23~L16~Variable Value~Low-Union~…the low-union sample consists of workers in industry-occupation cells with unioniation rates of less than 25.5% in 1983.
174~DV23~L17~Variable Value~High-Union~…all workers in industry-occupation cells with higher unionization rates than 25.5% are in the high-union sample.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…Dependent variable: col. 1 = log (current wage/previous wage); col. 2 = log (previous wage); col. 3 = log (current wage).
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…to continue to assess the empirical support for the predictions of the model, researchers present estimates (in table 3) of the coefficient on a layoff dummy in regressions of (i) the change in earnings; (ii) predisplacement earnings; and (iii) postdisplacement earnings on a standard set of worker characteristics, year-of-dispalcement dummies, region dummies, a dummy variable for advance notification of displacement, and one-digit predisplacement occupation and industry dummies. The wage-change and postdisplacement earnings equations also include years since displacement.
174~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Wage Changes~…the change in earnings as included as the dependent variable in estimates of the coefficient on a layoff dummy in earnings regressions.
174~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Predisplacement Earnings~…predisplacement earnings as included as the dependent variable in estimates of the coefficient on a layoff dummy in earnings regressions.
174~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Postdisplacement Earnings~…postdisplacement earnings as included as the dependent variable in estimates of the coefficient on a layoff dummy in earnings regressions.
174~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Predisplacement Earnings~…earnings are deflated by the GNP deflator.

174~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Worker Characteristics~…a standard set of worker characteristics as included in earnings regressions estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy.
174~D1~V17~Variable~Year-of-Displacement~…a year-of-displacement indicator as included in earnings regressions estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy.
174~D1~V21~Variable~Region~…a region indicator as included in earnings regressions estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy.
174~D1~V12~Variable~Advance Notification of Displacement~…an advanced notification of displacement as included in earnings regressions estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy.
174~D1~V14~Variable~Previous-Occupation~…one-digit predisplacement occupation dummies as included in earnings regressions estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy.
174~D1~V18~Variable~Previous-Industry~…one-digit predisplacement industry dummies as included in earnings regressions estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy.
174~D1~V22~Variable~Years Since Displacement~…the wage-change and postdisplacement earnings equations estimating the coefficient on a layoff dummy also include years since displacement.
174~D1~F7~Findings~Layoffs vs. Plant Closings Displacement and Wage Loss~…workers displaced through layoffs experience approximately 4% larger wage reductions than do workers with the same measured predisplacement characteristics who were displaced in plant closings. This effect is perhaps stronger than it might appear because it is net of two effects in the opposite direction: first, workers involved in plant closings seem more likely to be located in distressed local labor markets, and, second, many of the layoffs in the sample are likely to have been determined by strict seniority systems. Columns 2 and 3 reveal, however, that the estimate in column 1 arises both from the slightlyhigher predisplacement earnigns and from the slightly lower postdisplacement earnings of those displaced by layoffs. The model predicts only the lower postdisplacement earnings.
174~D1~F8~Findings~Reemployment Earnings Among White-Collar Workers~…among white-collar workers, reemployment earnings are estimated to be more than 6% lower for those displaced by layoffs than for those displaced by plant closings; no similar difference is apparent for blue-collar workers. Thus, for white-collar workers there is fairly strong evidence supporting the lemons effect.
174~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Unionization Extent~…an alternative approach to determining whether workers were displaced from jobs that were likely to be governed by formal layoff-by-seniority rules is to classify workers by the likelihood that their predisplacement jobs were unionized. Since the DWS does not provide information on whether a worker's predisplacement job was unionized, researchers used the extent of unionization in a worker's predisplacement industry-occupation cell to determine whether the worker's predisplacement job was likely to be covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the DWS does not provide information on whether a worker's predisplacement job was unionized.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers used all 12 outgoing rotation groups from the 1983 Current Population Survye (the full-year sample) to generate a sample of workers comparable to the relevant DWS sample and then to compute unionization rates for white- and blue-collar workers in each three digit industry. Researchers then classified workers into high- and low-union subsample depending on whether their predisplacement industry-occupation cell had a unionization rate above or below the sample median rate of 25.5%
174~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Unionization Extent~…researchers used all 12 outgoing rotation groups from the 1983 Current Population Survye (the full-year sample) to generate a sample of workers comparable to the relevant DWS sample and then to compute unionization rates for white- and blue-collar workers in each three digit industry.

174~DV23~L17~Variable Value~High-Union~…the mean unionization rates in the high-union subsample is 50.3%.
174~DV23~L16~Variable Value~Low-Union~…the mean unionization rates in the low-union subsample is 9.7%.
174~D1~DV24~Derived Variable~Industry-Occupation Cells~…unionization rates were computed for 420 industry-occupation cells using a 210-industry by two-occupation (i.e. white- and blue-collar) classification scheme. The sample was restricted to 20-61-year-old, male, full-time, private-sector, employees not working in agriculture or construction. The sample consisted of 53,972 obserations satisfying these criteria.

The sample consisted of 53,972 obserations satisfying these criteria.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the unionization rate sample was restricted to 20-61-year-old, male, full-time, private-sector, employees not working in agriculture or construction. The sample consisted of 53,972 obserations satisfying these criteria.
174~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Unionization Extent~…workers were classified as unionized if they were union members and/or employed in a job covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
174~D1~F9~Findings~Reemployment Earnings Among Low-Union Workers~…the reemployment earnings of low-union workers displaced by layoffs are estimated to be approximately 4.5% lower than are those of low-union workers displaced by plant losings, while no such gap is apparent in the high-union sample.
174~D1~V6~Variable~Layoff Decision~…according to (a simple extension of) the current model, the informatin content of a layoff also should be greater where employers have better information about workers' abilities. Since some time may have to elapse before the current employer can accurately evaluate a worker's ability (perhaps because the employer is unable to learn the worker's ability until the worker learns the job), it may be that layoffs after brief employment spells signal little information to prospective employers.
174~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Output~...some time may have to elapse before the current employer can accurately evaluate a worker's ability (perhaps because the employer is unable to learn the worker's ability until the worker learns the job).
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…to study the possibility that layoffs after brief employment spells signal little information to prospective employers, researchers exlored whether the lemons effect associated with layoffs differs for workers with more versus less predisplacement job tenure. To do so, researchers reestimated the regression (in rows 1 to 3 of table 3) after replacing the layoff dummy with two interactions between the layoff dummy and two predisplacement tenure dummies - a low-tenure dummy for predisplacement tenure less than 2 years and a high-tenure dummy for predisplacement tenure of at least 2 years. (The results of these regressions are presented in table 4). Researchers also computed the analogous estimates using low- and high-tenure dummies defined as less than and at least 1 year of predisplacement tenure, respectively. Because the sample of such low-tenure workers is extremely small, though, the estimates for the low-tenure subsample are quite imprecise and the estimates for the high-tenure subsample are very similar to the estimates for the whole sample (presented in table 3).
174~V9~L18~Variable Value~Low-Tenure~…a low-tenure dummy for predisplacement tenure less than 2 years.
174~V9~L19~Variable Value~High-Tenure~…a high-tenure dummy for predisplacement tenure of at least 2 years.
174~D1~V6~Variable~Layoff Decision~…a dummy variable equal to 1 if a CPS respondent has been laid off as the coefficient of interest in earnings regressions.
174~D1~DV25~Derived Variable~Layoff, Low-Tenure~…the layoff dummy is replaced with two interactions between the layoff dummy and two predisplacement tenure dummies, including a low-tenure dummy for predisplacement tenure less than 2 years.
174~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Layoff, High-Tenure~…the layoff dummy is replaced with two interactions between the layoff dummy and two predisplacement tenure dummies, including a high-tenure dummy for predisplacement tenure of at least 2 years.
174~D1~F10~Findings~Tenure Experience, Occupation, and Loss in Postdisplacement Earnings~…for the whole sample and for white- and blue-collar workers considered separately, workers with less than 2 years of tenure experience essentially no (statistically significant) different effect from a layoff. Not surprisingly, therefore, the estimates for workers with at least 2 years of tenure are amplified versions of the estimates that do not allow for tenure differences. For high-tenure white-collar workers, for example, the extra loss in postdisplacement earnings following a layoff rather than a plant closing is 8.2% rather than the 6.4% for all white-collar workers (reported in table 3). As before the analogous loss for high-tenure blue-collar workers is zero, as is the influence of a layoff on the predisplacement earnings of high-tenure white-collar workers. The influence of a layoff on the predisplacement earnings of high-tenure blue-collar workers is not (a statistically significant) 4% rather than (an insignificant) 2%.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…since the equations (presented in table 3) were estimated on the sample of displaced workers who were reemployed at the survey date, the estimates potentially reflect sample-selection bias. 
174~D1~M2~Methodology~Heckit~…the first step researchers take in correcting the problem of sample-selection bias is by reestimating the models (presented in table 3) using the two-stage sample selection bias correction approach of Heckman (1979). The reemployment probit equations in the first stage of the Heckit procedure were estimated on the basic sample plus displaced males who were unemployed, self-employed, or employed, and earning less than $40 a week at the survey date. The reemployment probit includes the same variables as the independent variables in the wage regressions (in table 3). Since researchers could not make a convincing exclusion restriction (i.e. identify a variable that affects the probability of reemployment at the survey date but does not affect earnings), the Heck models are identified only by the nonlinearity of the sample-selection bias correction term (the inverse Mills ratio).
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the reemployment probit equations in the first stage of the Heckit procedure were estimated on the basic sample plus displaced males who were unemployed, self-employed, or employed, and earning less than $40 a week at the survey date.
174~D1~F11~Findings~Heckit Estimation Results~…the Heckit estimates of the layoff-dummy coefficients for white-collar workers are -0.055 in the wage change equation, -0.0093 in the predisplacement earnings equation, and -0.064 in the postdisplacement earnings equation.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…as a second approach to the sample-selection problem, researchers examined the subsample of workers who were displaced at least 2 years prior to the survey date. These workers have had a substantial amount of time to find a new job. Also the effects of short-lived bad matched and temporary jobs after displacement should be reduced.
174~D1~L20~Variable Value~2 Years or More~…as a second approach to the sample-selection problem, researchers examined the subsample of workers who were displaced at least 2 years prior to the survey date. These workers have had a substantial amount of time to find a new job. Also the effects of short-lived bad matched and temporary jobs after displacement should be reduced.
174~D1~F12~Findings~2 Years or More of Displacement Sample Results~…the layoff effects for white-collar workers displaced at least 2 years before the survey date are similar to the analogous effects for the entire white-collar sample, and the findings for the whole sample and for blue-collar workers are in the spirit of the analogous results (in table 3).
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in addition to sample bias, a second potential bias arises in the results because the DWS asks respondents about events that occurred as long as 5 years prior to the survey date. Thus, some respondents may have either completely forgotten events that occurred in the distant past or rememberd such events but misreported the dates at which they occured, or both. In brief, researchers find three reasons why retrospection bias appears not to be an important problem here. First, while researchers cannot reject the possibility that such a bias explains the results for the sample as a whole, the data do not support the conjecture that such a bias explains the current results for white- versus blue-collar workers. Second, the presence of such a bias would seem to suggest that the lemons effect should grow (in absolute value) with years since displacement, but it does not. And third the effect of such a bias would seem to be reduced for workers displaced from jobs with long predisplacement tenure, but (as reported in table 4) the qualitative properties of the current empirical results are not only preserved but even strengthened by focusing on workers with long predisplacement tenure.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the DWS asks respondents about events that occurred as long as 5 years prior to the survey date. Thus, some respondents may have either completely forgotten events that occurred in the distant past or rememberd such events but misreported the dates at which they occured, or both.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the current sample (including those not reemployed at the survey date), the layoffs reported in the 1984 DWS are 314, 504, and 484 for 1981 to 1983, respectively, while those reported in the 1986 DWS are 142, 258, and 188 for the same years. The plant closings reported in the 1984 DWS, in contrast, are 238, 298, and 272 for 1981-83, respectively, while those reported in the 1986 DWS are 227, 247, and 242 for the same years.
174~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Initial Spell of Joblessness~…researchers know of two potential explanations for the fact that workers permanently displaced by plant closings experience shorter unemployment spells than do workers permanently displaced by layoffs. The first potential explanation focuses on the importance of recall expectations in the job-search behavior of the unemployed: workers displaced by layffs are more likely to think they may be recalled to their preunemployment jobs than are workers displaced in plant closings; higher recall expectations are likely to reduce the new-job-finding rate by reducing search intensity and making workers choosier about new jobs. the second potential explanation involves a simple extension of the current model. The model yields predictions about wage changes at displacement but also predicts that there will be no post-displacement unemployment.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the model yields predictions about wage changes at displacement but also predicts that there will be no post-displacement unemployment. The latter prediction arise for a simple reason: for any belief about a worker's ability, there is always a wage low enought that firms will be willing to hire the worker.
174~D1~M3~Methodology~Weibull~…in an attempt to assess the extent to which a lemons effect contributes to the current finding that workers permanently displaced by layoffs experience longer unemployment spells than do those displaced by plant closings, researchers used the January 1986 DWS to construct a sample of first spells of joblessness for 20-61 year-old males permanently displaced from full-time private-sector jobs not in agriculture or construction. The sample contains 830 complete initial spells of joblessness and 498 censored spells. Researchers analyze the duration of initial spells of joblessness for this sample using formal hazard-model techniques. The hazard rate is parameterized using a Weibull specification.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in an attempt to assess the extent to which a lemons effect contributes to the current finding that workers permanently displaced by layoffs experience longer unemployment spells than do those displaced by plant closings, researchers used the January 1986 DWS to construct a sample of first spells of joblessness for 20-61 year-old males permanently displaced from full-time private-sector jobs not in agriculture or construction. The sample contains 830 complete initial spells of joblessness and 498 censored spells.
174~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Initial Spell of Joblessness~…researchers analyze the duration of initial spells of joblessness for the permanently displaced 1986 DWS sample using formal hazard-model techniques.
174~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate~…researchers parameterize the hazard rate (i.e., the escape rate from joblessness) using a Weibull specification. The hazard rate for an individual at time t is contingent on a vector of time-invariant covariates for an individual I, the Weibull duration-dependence parameter, and a vector of parameters.
174~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Initial Spell of Joblessness~…let T(i) be the length of individual (i)'s unemployment spell.
174~D1~M3~Methodology~Weibull~…the Weibull specification of the hazard function implies that the log of the failure time for (i) (i.e., Y(i) = log T(i)) can be written as a regression model where 1/a is known as the Weibull scale parameter, [beta] = the negative of the Weibull scale parameter multiplied by a vector of parameters, and an error term with an extreme-value distribution. Equation (7).
174~D1~M3~Methodology~Weibull~…(Table 6) presents maximum-likelihood estimates of Weibull duration models for the initial spell of joblessness following displacement of the 1986 DWS sample. For ease of interpretation, researchers present the estimates in the form of the regression model in equation (7): researchers report the parameter [beta](j) for each covariate X(j). The estimates thus can be interpreted as the effects of the covariates on the expected log duration of joblessness.
174~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the january 1984 DWS only provides information on total weeks of joblessness since displacement and so does not allow one to determine the length of the initial spell of joblessness. The January 1986 DWS, in contrast, provides information on the number of jobs held by a worker since displacement. This variable and information on total weeks of joblessness since displacement allow one to determine both the length of the initial spell of joblessness for those employed in their first job since displacement at the survey date and the censored length of the initial spell for those who had worked since displacement.
174~D1~V10~Variable~Weeks of Joblessness After Displacement~…the DWS provides information on the total weeks of joblessness since displacement.
174~D1~V23~Variable~Number of Jobs Since Displacement~…the January 1986 DWS provides information on the number of jobs held by a worker since displacement.
174~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Initial Spell of Joblessness~…the number of jobs held by a worker since displacement and the information on total weeks of joblessness since displacement allows one to determine the length of the initial spell of joblessness for those employed in their first job since displacement at the survey date.
174~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Censored Initial Spell of Joblessness~…the number of jobs held by a worker since displacement and the information on total weeks of joblessness since displacement allows one to idetermine the censored length of the initial spell for those who had not worked since displacement.
174~D1~V10~Variable~Weeks of Joblessness After Displacement~…the variable that measures weeks of joblessness since displacement is top-coded at 99.
174~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Censored Initial Spell of Joblessness~…researchers treat initial spells of joblessness top-coded at 99 as being censored at 99 weeks.
174~D1~M3~Methodology~Weibull~…the dependent variable in Weibull equations is the log of weeks of joblessness.
174~D1~M3~Methodology~Weibull~…NOTE: the reported models were estimated by maximum likelihood with left censoring explicitly treated using the LIFEREG procedure in SAS. The sample size is 1,228. The reportd specifications include education, a dummy for advance notification of displacement, year-of-displacemnt dummies, seven previous-industry dummies, eight previous-occupation dummies, experience (age - education - 6) and its square, a marriage dummy, a nonwhite dummy, and three region dummies. Fraction union is the 1983 fraction unionized of the worker's predisplacement industry-occupation cell. High union equals one for workers displaced from industry-occupation cells where the fraction unionized was greater than 25.5% in 1983. It equals zero otherwise.
174~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Unionization Extent~…fraction union is the 1983 fraction unionized of the worker's predisplacement industry-occupation cell.
174~DV23~L17~Variable Value~High-Union~…high union equals one for workers displaced from industry-occupation cells where the fraction unionized was greater than 25.5% in 1983; it equals zero otherwise.
174~D1~F13~Findings~Layoff Dummy Coefficient Estimates and Unemployment Spells~…the coefficient estimate for the layoff dummy (in column 1 of table 6) indicates that workers permanently displaced by layoffs have approximately 25% longer initial unemployment spells than do those displaced in plant closings. This finding is consisten with the current (extended) lemons model but of course is also consistent with a recall-expectations model.
174~D1~F14~Findings~Occupations, Reason for Displacement, and Unemployment Spells~…workers permanently displaced by layoffs experience significantly longer initial unemployment spells than do workers displaced by plant closings, regardless of whether the displacement is from a white- or blue-collar job. (More precisely, the point estimates in col. 2 suggest that the effect is slightly smaller for white collar workers but far from statistically significantly so.) Since white-collar workers are much less likely to expect to be recalled than are blue-collar workers, the similarity in the impact of the layoff dummy on unemployment durations for the two groups suggests that a lemons affect may be influencing the postdisplacement unemployment duration of white-collar workers permanently displaced by layoffs.
174~DV23~L17~Variable Value~High-Union~…in Weibull regressions the measure of the extent of unionization is a dummy variable equal to one if the rate exceeds 25.5%.
174~D1~F15~Findings~Low-Union Workers, Reason for Displacement, and Unemployment Spells~…it is found that, for workers from low-unionization predisplacement industries and occupations, those displaced by layoffs experience significantly longer (approximately 35% longer) postdisplacement unemployment durations than do those displaced by plant closings. It is also found that, for workers from high-unionization predisplacement industries and occupations, those displaced by layoffs experience only 5% longer unemployment spells than do those displaced by plant closings; this difference in unemployment duration etween those laid off from low- versus high-unionization industries and occupations is statistically significant.
174~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Layoff, Unionization Extent~…in (column 4 of) the Weibull model, researchers interact the layoff dummy with the unionization rate (i.e., the continuous variable that underliese the unionization dummy) of the worker's predisplacement industry and occupation.
174~D1~M3~Methodology~Weibull~…in (column 4 of) the Weibull model, researchers interact the layoff dummy with the unionization rate (i.e., the continuous variable that underliese the unionization dummy) of the worker's predisplacement industry and occupation.
174~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Output~…a worker's current employer is assumed to be better informed about the worker's productive ability than prospective employers are.
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…the key feature of the current model is that, when firms have discretion with respect to whom to lay off, the market infers that laid-off workers are of low ability. Under the assumption that no such negative inference is warranted if workes are displaced in a plant closing, the current model predictst that the postdisplacement wages of otherwise observationally equivalent workers will be lower for those displaced by layoffs than those displaced by plant closings.
174~D1~DV20~Variable~Predisplacement Earnings~…in the current model, it is the layoff even that signals unfavorable information to the market, so the model predicts that the predisplacement wages of (otherwise observationally) equivalent workers will not differ according to the cause of displacement.
174~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Initial Spell of Joblessness~…a simple extension of the model predicts that the average postdisplacement unemployment spell of otherwise observationally equivalent workers will be shorter for those displaced by plant closings than for those permanently displaced by layoffs.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in order for a symmetric-information model to match with the empirical findings, the model must provide descriptions of why layoffs occur (rather than wage changes) and of which workers are laid off. Having done this, the model must then explain why laid-off workers fare worse than those displaced by plant closings, in terms of postdisplacement wages and unemployment durations, but are no different in terms of predisplacement wages.
174~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Firm Wage Offer~…in equilibrium, the firm cannot retain low-ability workers at a low wage: if it could, it would also retain high-ability workers at the lwo wage, which would destroy the market's willingness to  allow any workers to be retained at the low wage.
174~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the current empirical results are not conclusive proof that asymmetric information plays an important role in the labor market. Rather, researchers interpret the results as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for confidence in models based on asymmetric information about worker's abilities: had the estimates rejected the model, it would cast doubt on the entire family of models based on this kind of asymmetric information.
174~DV2~L7~Variable Value~n*~…there exists a unique n* satisfying (3) and that n* < n(H). At n* = n(L), the right-hand side of (3) exceeds the left; at n* = n(H), the left exceeds the right; and the derivative of the left hand side with respect to n* is one, which exceeds the derivative of the right-hand side becase the fact that f(n) is log concave implies that d{E(n|n>=x)}/dx <= 1 for every x. Note that the same monotonicity argument implies that, if n[R] < n*, then n[R] + s < E(n|n >= n[R]).
174~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Market Wage~…at w(m) = n(L), the right-hand side of (1) is positive because the first term is positive and the probability term in the second term is zero. At w(m) = n(L), the right-hand side is negative because the first term is negative and the second term is either negative or zero (depending on whether the probability term is positive or zero). Finally, the derivate of the right-hand side with respect to m(w) is negative because d{F(x)[E(n|n<x) - x]}/dx = -F(x) < 0 for every x. Thus, given n[R], (1) has a unique solution.
174~DV2~L6~Variable Value~Retain Ability~…the firm lays off a worker if and only if the worker's ability is less than n[R].
174~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Retain Wage Offer~…offering a lower wage attracts no workers and so earns no profit. Offering a higher wage attracts all rather than half of the pool of workers that would otherwise accept the market's offer and also attracts the lowest-ability workers that the firm would otherwise retain, but the prosepctive employer earns negative profit on both groups.
174~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Layoff Wage Offer~…offering a lower wage attracts no workers and so earns no profit. Offering a higher wage attracts all rather than half of the pool of workers that would otherwise accept the market's offer and also attracts the lowest-ability workers that the firm would otherwise retain, but the prosepctive employer earns negative profit on both groups.
174~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Layoff Rule~…any equilibrium layoff rule leads to a reemployment wage for laid-off workers satisfying w(2)(L) < E(n).
174~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Layoff Rule~…if the firm's layoff rule has L(n) = 1 for some n,then it must be that n + s <= w(m), so E[n|L(n) = 1] < w(m).

175~D1, D4, D5~V4~Variable~Marital Status~…agents change their marital status as often as people do in the United States, an aspect that is embedded in a standard macroeconomic growth model: individuals in a married household solve a joint maximization problem that takes into account that, in the future, the marriage may break up because of death or divorce.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Two-Sex OLG Model~…researchers use individual couples' choices of life insurance purchases as well as aggregate restrictions to identify how individuals assess their utilities in different demographic stages.
175~D1, D4, D5~V1~Variable~Consumption~...the household composition affects the utility of agents, not only because of altruism toward descendents but also because it affects how consumption expenditures translate into consumption enjoyed.
175~D1, D4, D5~V1~Variable~Consumption~…household composition also matters for earning because the specificity with which the household composition affects agents changes over time, as the number of dependants evolves and as earnings varies translating into different amounts of life insurance being purchased.
175~D1~V6~Variable~Life Insurance Claims~…changes in the amoung of life insurance being purchased, and in effect the amount of life insurance claims one holds, contain a lof information about how agents' utility changes.
175~D1, D5~F1~Findings~Average Dependent Bequest Rate~…estimates indicate that a single male in the last period of his life will choose to leave more than 50% of his resources as a bequest, suggesting that individuals are very caring for their dependants.
175~D1, D4, D5~F2~Findings~Economies of Scale Through Marriage~…it costs $1.32 to provide for two people living together what it costs each of them $1 living apart, suggesting that large economies of scale exist in consumption when couples live together..
175~D1, D4, D5~F3~Findings~High Marginal Cost of Children~…a single man with one child has to spend $5.57 to get the same marginal utility that he would have had if he did not have dependents and spent $1.00, suggesting that children are extremely expensive, especially for males.
175~D1, D4, D5~F4~Findings~Gender Differences In Successful Providing~…children who live with either single women or married couples require 48% less expenditures to keep marginal utility constant than children who live with single men, suggesting that women are much better at providing for children than men.

175~V11~L5~Variable Value~Term Insurance~…renewal of such a policy typically involves an increase in the premium because the policy-holder's mortality is increasing with age.
175~V11~L6~Variable Value~Whole Life Insurance~…does not have any expiration date, as when signing the contract, the insurance company and the premiumholders agree to set a face value and a monthly premium which remains constant throughout the life of the policy.
175~V11~L6~Variable Value~Whole Life Insurance~…offers a combination of insurance and savings, granting the requirement of having to subtract this saving component from the face value to get the pure insurance amount.
175~D1~D1~Dataset~International Survey of Consumer Financial Decisions for 1990~…is not very explicit about what type of insurance it refers to.
175~D2~D2~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…from 1992 documents the face values of term insurance and whole insurance separately as well as their cash values, which allows to compute the amount of pure insurance in each household solving the problem of inexplicit insurance type in the International Survey of Consumer Financial Decisions for 1990 data.
175~D2~T2~Time Period~1992.0~…survey year from which additional data from the Survey of Consumer Finances is drawn in order to calculate the pure insurance amount in each household.

175~D2~D2~Dataset~Survey of Consumer Finances~…it is important to note that the Survey of Consumer Finances collects information on life insurance for the whole household and in turn cannot distinguish between life insurance for the husband or for the wife in a married couple.
175~D1~D1~Dataset~International Survey of Consumer Financial Decisions for 1990~…in order to compare the amounts reported in the Stanford Research Institute data to that of the Survey of Consumer Finances, the face value for married men and women is combined by age to get the face value of married households in the SRI.
175~D1~D1~Dataset~International Survey of Consumer Financial Decisions for 1990~…estimates between Stanford Research Institute data and Survey of Consumer Finances data are extremely similar leading the researchers to conclude that the Stanford Research Institute data are a good measure of the amount of pure life insurance held by American households.
175~D1~D1~Dataset~International Survey of Consumer Financial Decisions for 1990~…limited as it pertains to this research paper in that it does not contain data on consumption and life insurance holdings for many households making it impossible to recover the relation of the utility function and the altruism function.

175~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…from 1989 to 1991 to compute the earnings of agents.
175~D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Labor Earnings~…labor earnings for different years are adjusted using the 1990 GDP deflator.
175~D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Labor Earnings~…labor earnings are distinguished by age, sex, and marital status.
175~D1, D4, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Marital Status and Gender~…the sample for earnings analysis is divided into 7 different marital statuses with regard to the four statuses and genders as a compromise for not having hours worked as married men have higher earnings than single men, while the opposite is true for women.
175~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in order to collect data on alimony and child support income of divorced women.
175~DV14~L22~Variable Value~Female Labor Earnings~…researchers add age-specific alimony and child support income to the earnings of divorced women on a per capita basis to account for the fact that most women who divorce receive custody of their children.

175~D1, D5~F1~Findings~Average Dependent Bequest Rate~…estimates imply that the average single man of a particular age with dependents consumes 45 cents and gives 55 cents as a bequest, while the estimates for single women range from consuming 37 cents for never married to 54 cents for a widow.
175~D4, D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Dependent Cost~…when researchers allowed the costs of child dependents to be different for married couples and single females, it was obtained that the estimate for a married couple is 2% lower than for single females, with small changes in the other parameters, and the gains in terms of accuracy to change from 11.8% to 12.9%, or around a 1.1 percentage point change.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Utility~…in the first alternative variation of the benchmark two-sex OLG model it is assumed that all singles enjoy the same utility for a dollar spent implying that those who are divorced/widowed are not different from those who never married.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5~F8~Findings~OECD Equivalence Scales Expenditure to Consumption Ratio~…when imposing OECD equivalence scales, each additional adult in a household requires an expenditure of 70 cents in order to enjoy one dollar of consumption, while each child requires 50 cents.
175~D1, D4~F9~Findings~50 Year Old Behavorial Changes~…as married men become 50, aggregate life insurance face value rises to 160% of GDP from 151%, while there is a 0.3% increase in total assets held.
175~D1, D4, D5, D6~F10~Findings~Compensation Variation and Welfare~…when computing the compensation variation, a measure of 0.999 is computed and it is found that survivor's benefits have no effect on welfare because as married men over age 50 increase their insurance holdings, their Social Security benefit increases, effects that cancel each other out.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Two-Sex OLG Model~…implies that women acquire strong habits while in a marriage.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 1~…assumes that all singles enjoy the same utility for a dollar spent, and in turn attempts to tilt consumption toward married females by choosing a much lower weight for the male than does the benchmark model.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 1~…limited in that this no-habit model generates too little life insurance holdings late, especially in the case of a male's death, relative to the data.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 2~…imposes a symmetric structure in the habits created by marriage.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 2~…limited in that this model gerates holdings of life insurance in the case of the death of older males that are too low.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 3~…assumes that men and women are equally good at home production.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 3~…predicts purchases of life insurance in the case of death of young married females that are too low, however the fit of this model is the best among alternative specifications.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M5~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 4~…for the sake of comparison with a very standard measure of what a household is, the model is reestimated imposing the OECD equivalence scales under which each additional adult in a household requires an expenditure of 70 cents in order to enjoy one dollar of consumption, while each child requires 50 cents, while also assuming that there are no habits or differences between males and females.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M5~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 4~…the patience and altruism parameters are reestimated as well as the weights in the joint maximization problem.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M5~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 4~…the model predicts that insurance is held in different circumstances from those in which people in the United States hold insurance, however underpredicts the holdings of married couples, especially late in life and conditional on the death of females.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M6~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 5~…imposes equal weights in the joint maximization problem, solved by a married couple, to see if this margin matters.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~M6~Methodology~Alternative Two-Sex OLG Model 5~…the model tries to account for what would be holdings of life insurance that are too low in the case where the wife dies by increasing men's disadvantage at home production dramatically from 102% versus 48%.
175~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~F11~Findings~Alternative Model vs. Benchmark Model~…the main conclsuion from the assessment of alternative models is that doing without any of the features of the benchmark model leads to a much worse fit of the model with the data, while finding that the OECD scales do a very bad job in accounting for the life insurance holding patterns.
175~D1, D4, D6~DV16~Derived Variable~Compensation Variation~…calculted by computing the ex post discounted lifetime utility of all newborns and then calculating what percentage change in consumption makes agents indifferent between living in the benchmark economy and in an economy without survivor benefits.
175~D1, D4, D5, D6~F12~Findings~Impact of Eliminating Social Security~…in an experiment where researchers eliminate Social Security, the response of the household is to drastically reduce its life insurance purchasing when reaching retirement age and total wealth in this economy becomes 50% hgher than that of the benchmark economy.
175~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…used in order to calculate the probability of remarrying, transitions from singles, transitions from married, and switches between two dependents status.
175~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…does not allow to calculate for mortality.
175~D3, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Mortality~…in order to account for mortality as it pertains to marital status transitions, first the complement of those who stay married to the same spouse is computed, then the probability of marital dissolution is defined as the maximum value and the probability of spousal death, and then finally the transition probabilities are redefined and the agent's own probability of death is accounted for.
176~176: Lifestyle Prices and Production~~~~
176~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
176~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Shopping Frequency and Prices Paid~…the data suggests that a doubling of shopping frequency lowers the price paid for a given good by approximately 10%.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…a novel data set used to document that households that shop more intensively pay lower prices for identical goods.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…data on time use merged with Homescan survey data used in order to estimate parameters of the shopping and home production technologies households employ to minimize total cost of cosumption.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…the output of a production function that combines market goods and time.
176~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…this function allows households to substitute time for expenditures optimally in response to fluctuations in the relative cost of time.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…data used in order to explore how prices for goods vary across households in practice, and to what extent this variation accords with standard theory.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this survey collects grocery scanner data at the level of the households; each purchase in the database records the actual price paid by the household at the level of the Universal product Code bar code.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this database is novel in the sense that it has detailed demographics about the household making the purchases and it tracks the household purchases across multiple retail outlets.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…because this dataset includes information about the shopping trip, researchers can infer the household's shopping intensity.
176~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Prices Paid and Household Income~…researchers find that the price paid for a particular good is an increasing function of income; specifically, households with annual income over $70,000 pay 5% more on average for an identical good (defined by UPC) than households earning less than $30,000. this result is consistent with the fact that high-income households face a higher opportunity cost of time.
176~D1, D2, D4~F3~Findings~Family Composition and Prices Paid~…it is found that households with more children pay higher prices than households with fewer or no children; this effect is robust to controls for income. Given the additional time demands associated with having children, households with more children will have higher opportunity costs of time compared with households with no children, all else being equal.
176~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Prices Paid Over the Life Cycle~…one of the most striking results of this research is that prices paid by households are hump-shaped over the life cycle: households with heads in their early forties pay, on average, between 6% and 8% more for identical goods than either households with heads in their early twenties or households with heads in their late sixties; this result is consistent with the idea that households with heads in their forties face the highest market opportunity cost of time (the highest wages) as well as the highest nonmarket demands on time (the most children).
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…given the price data, as well as information on shopping frequency in the Homescan data set, a shopping function that maps time and quantity purchased into price is able to be estimated.
176~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Shopping Function~…given the price data, as well as information on shopping frequency in the Homescan data set, a shopping function that maps time and quantity purchased into price is able to be estimated.
176~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Shopping Frequency and Prices Paid~…all else being equal, households that double their shopping frequency will pay prices that are 5% to 12% lower, on average.
176~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…optimality implies that the shopper equates the marginal value of additional shopping for lower prices to the opportunity cost of time; with this in mind; the observed shopping behavior, as well as the estimated shopping function, are used to calculate the shopper's opportunity cost of time for each household.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…price data is used to estimate the parameters of a home production assumption.
176~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…price data from the Homescan survey is used to estimate the parameters of a home production function.
176~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…the identification assumption is that the opportunity cost of time of the shopper is the same as that of the person undertaking home production.
176~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…the identification assumption is that the opportunity cost of time of the shopper is the same as that of the person undertaking home production.
176~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Marginal Rate of Transformation~…under the identification assumption that the opportunity cost of time of the shopper is the same as that of the person undertaking home production, the marginal rate of transformation of time to dollars in shopping is equated to that in home production.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…using detailed data on time spent in home production from this data source, researchers can use the first-order condition between shopping and home production to estimate the parameters of the home production function.
176~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…researchers use the first-order condition between shopping and home production to estimate the parameters of the home production function from the American Time Use Survey data; the advantage of this approach is that the assumptipon that the cost of time in home production is the market wage need not be made.
176~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…because researchers do not need to assume that the cost of time in home production is the market wage, a price of time may be calculate for retirees and for married households with only on worker.
176~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Elasticity of Substitution Between Time and Goods~…an elasticity of substitution between time and goods in home production is estimated to be close to 2, and, in all specifications, the null hypothesis that the elasticity is 1 or less can be rejected.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…this variable is calculated using observed inputs of time and in market goods given the home production function.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…this series over the life cycle in a manner distinct from household expenditures.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Implied Consumption to Expenditures~…the ratio of implied consumpion to expenditures declines as household heads enter middle age and then rises rapidly through their retirement.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Implied Consumption to Expenditures~…the lifecycle profits of this ratio reflects the changing cost of time as household heads age and highlights the danger of inferring the lifecycle profile of consumption directly from expenditures.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers incorporate into an otherwise-standard model of lifecycle consumption that the fact that households can shop for bargains and undertake home production.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…researchers incorporate into an otherwise-standard model of lifecycle consumption that the fact that households can shop for bargains and undertake home production.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the simple model augmented with home production and shopping can match the data quantitatively along a variety of dimensions.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…this model matches the empirical lifecycle profiles of time spent shopping, time spent in home production, and prices paid.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…this model matches the empirical lifecycle profiles of time spent shopping, time spent in home production, and prices paid.
176~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~..the wedge between household market expenditures and actual household consumption increases as the price of time increases.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…the data used, and the accompanying model, provide a microfounded story of how the ability to home produce and shop implies a nonseparability between expenditure and leisure even when utility is separable over consumption and leisure.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…the data used, and the accompanying model, provide a microfounded story of how the ability to home produce and shop implies a nonseparability between expenditure and leisure even when utility is separable over consumption and leisure.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the data used, and the accompanying model, provide a microfounded story of how the ability to home produce and shop implies a nonseparability between expenditure and leisure even when utility is separable over consumption and leisure.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…the data used, and the accompanying model, provide a microfounded story of how the ability to home produce and shop implies a nonseparability between expenditure and leisure even when utility is separable over consumption and leisure.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…price data is drawn from the ACNielsen Homescan Panel.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this database is designed to capture all consumer grocery packaged goods purchaed by the household at a wide variety of retail outlets.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this database is used for Denver, covering the period January 1993 through March 1995, and is designed to be representative of the Denver metropolitant statistical area, and summary demographics line up well with the estimates from the 1994 Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
176~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…used in order to compare summary demographics to that of the ACNielsen's Homescan survey in order to determine the quality of representation in the Homescan survey.
176~D1, D3~T1~Time Period~1993-1995~…survey period through which the Homescan database is used for Denver, covering the period January 1993 through March 1995.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…for proprietary reasons, the ACNielsen Company is reluctant to release any of the homescan data; however, in the late 1990s, the Denver survey data was available to academics for resarch. For this reason, researchers have access only to the Denver data from the early 1990s.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…respondents in the Homescan survey remain in the survey for upwards of 27 months.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this survey is implemented at the household level and contains detailed demographics, which are updated annually; specifically, the characteristics of the household include the head's age, sex, race, education, and employment status and the family composition and household income.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…for the head of household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Sex~…for the head of household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1~V3~Variable~Race~…for the head of household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Education~…for the head of household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1~V5~Variable~Employment Status~…for the head of household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Family Composition~…the family composition for a household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1~V6~Variable~Household Income~…the level of income for a household as reported in the ACNielsen's Homescan survey.
176~D1~V5~Variable~Employment Status~…broadly measured as a categorical variable.
176~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Household Income~…broadly measured as a categorical variable.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…households selected for the Homescan sample are equipped with an electronic home scanning unit and after every shopping trip, the shopper scans the UPC bar codes of all purchased packaged goods.
176~D1~V7~Variable~UPC Code~…each type of packaged good has a unique UPC bar code printed on its packaging, a code that is so specific that a liter bottle of Pepsi, a six pack of Pepsi cans, and a twelve pack of Pepsi cans all have distinct UPC bar codes.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…the shopper provides three pieces of information in addition to the UPC code scans regarding each transaction: the date, the store, and the total amount of discounts due to promotions, sales, or coupons.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…the scanners are programmed to include all the stores in the household's shopping area (including grocery stores, convenience stores, specialty stores, super centers, and price clubs; if a household member shops at a store outside the defined shopping area, the household can manually input the store information.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…ACNielsen maintains a database of current prices for all stores within the metropolitan area; given the store and date information, ACNielsen can link each product scanned by the household to the actual price for which it was selling at the retail establishment.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…in terms of associated demographics and coverage of multiple outlets, the Homescan database is superior to retail-based scanner data for lifecycle analysis.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…within the Homescan data set, there are 2,100 separate households and over 950,000 transactions; for the relevant analysis, researchers focus on households in which the average age of the primary shopper is between the ages of 24 and 75, and, unless otherwise noted, the age of the household head is restricted to be at least 25. These restrictions leave the sample to include just over 2,000 households.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this database is essentially a cross-section at a given point in time over the 27 months of the relevant survey period
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…issues with this data include representativeness of the households in the Homescan sample, coverage of the goods scanned by households in the sample, sample attrition, and the importance of store and grocery-chain fixed effects.
176~D1~V8~Variable~Price of Good~…households may pay less than the stated store price if they use coupons or avail themselves of in-store discounts; this information is manually entered by household members. Given that this information is likely fraught with large amounts of measurement error, researchers do not use it when computing and reporting price indices; however, as a robustness check, analysis is repeated including the coupon information when computing price differences across households.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…the Homescan database records up to three ages for each household: that of the male head, the female head, and the primary shopper.
176~D1~V8~Variable~Price of Good~…programmed into the UPC bar code and based on individual stores in the household's shopping area including grocery stores, convenience stores, specialty stores, super centers, and price clubs.
176~D1~V8~Variable~Price of Good~…ACNielsen maintains a database of current prices for all stores within the metropolitan area; given the store and date information, ACNielsen can link each product scanned by the household to the actual price for which it was selling at the retail establishment.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…categorical variables separated for male and female heads; given the fact that the head's ages are recorded in five-year blocks (for example, 25 to 29), the majority of married-couple households report the same age category for both heads.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…because many married-couple households report the same age category for both heads, it makes little difference to the analysis in this research whether the shopper's age, the male head's age, or the female head's age is used.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…because many married-couple households report the same age category for both heads, it makes little difference to the analysis in this research whether the shopper's age, the male head's age, or the female head's age is used.
176~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Shopper's Age~…the age of the primary shopper, recorded as a positive integer.
176~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Shopper's Age~…the age of the primary shopper may change from shopping trip to shopping trip, depending on who did the shopping for the household.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…the main age variable used in the relevant analysis.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…when two heads of household are present, researchers follow standard practice and use the male head's age.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…standard economics suggest that, all else being equal, households with a lower opportunity cost of time will be more likely to spend time searching/shopping to reduce the price paid for a given market good.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…using this data, researchers can test the basic premise that households with a lower opportunity cost of time pay lower prices for identical goods.
176~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Average Price Per Trip~…given the fact that households buy a variety of different goods during each trip, researchers must define an average price measure for each household.
176~D1~V8~Variable~Price of Good~…the price of a specific good purchased by a specific household on a specific shopping date.
176~D1~V10~Variable~Quantity of Good~…the quantity of a specific good purchased by a specific household on a specific shopping date.
176~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Average Price Per Trip~…because there may be another household purchasing the same good at a different price, the average price measure is averaged over households within the month to obtain the average price paid for a given good during that month, where the average is weighted by quantity purchased.
176~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Average Price of Good~…because there may be another household purchasing the same good at a different price, researchers average over households within the month to obtain the average price paid for a given good during that month.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…defined for the household as the ratio of expenditures at actual prices to the cost of the bundle at average prices; this index is normalized by dividing through the average price index across households within the month, ensuring that for each month the index is centered around 1.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…this index shares the typical feature that the basket of goods is held constant as prices vary between the numerator and denominator.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…in a standard price index, the relative price of two goods may differ across time periods; however, in the current framework, the distribution of prices for any two goods is the same across households, but the relative price of time varies, resulting in variation in the relative purchase price of goods.
176~DV11~L1~Variable Value~Greater Than 1~…a price index greater than 1 reflects a household that pays higher prices on average; it is important to note that the price premium is not reflecting higher quality.
176~DV11~L2~Variable Value~Less Than 1~…a price index lower than 1 reflects a household that pays lower prices on average; it is important to note that the price discount is not reflecting lower quality.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…with the current index, the price differentials are for the identical goods as defined by the UPC.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…an alternative price index could be constructed by forming the ratio of price to average price for each good and averaging across the household's basket, however, the difference between that measure and the current index is not substantial in practice in that the share a correlation coefficient of 0.8.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…using the price index, researchers can revisit whether prices paid for the same goods vary across households with different costs of time.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…one measure of the opportunity cost of time is the market wage.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…in the Homescan data, wages are not available; only categorical measures of household income are included.
176~D1~V6~Variable~Household Income~…using the Homescan data, researchers aggregate up to four income categories.
176~V6~L3~Variable Value~Below $30,000~…indicates household income below $30,000.
176~V6~L4~Variable Value~$30,000-$50,000~…indicates household income between $30,000 and $50,000.
176~V6~L5~Variable Value~$50,000-$70,000~…indicates household income between $50,000 and $70,000.
176~V6~L6~Variable Value~Above $70,000~…indicates houeshold income greater than $70,000.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Mean Price Index~…a measure of the mean price index for households within the four income categories including below $30,000, $30,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $70,000 and above $70,000.
176~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Low Income and Prices Paid~…households that earn less than $30,000 a year, on average, pay 5% lower prices than households that earn over $70,000 (with a p-value of difference < 0.01); technically the difference in the price index is 0.05 points, however, this difference is refered to as an approximate 5% increase due to the normalization of the price index to 1 (this caveat holds throughout further analysis).
176~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Middle income and Prices Paid~…households that earn between $30,000 and $50,000 pay, on average, 3% lower prices than households that earn over $70,000 (with a p-value of difference < 0.01).
176~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Low vs. Middle Income and Prices Paid~..the difference in prices paid between households that earn less than $30,000 and households that earn between $30,000 and $50,000, 2%, is statistically significant (with a p-value of difference = 0.04).
176~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Middle-High vs. High Income and Prices Paid~…there is no significant difference in prices paid by households earnings between $50,000 and $70,000 and those households earning above $70,000 (with a p-value of difference = 0.66).
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…influenced by the large time demand associated with raising children.
176~D1, D2, D5~F10~Findings~Household Members and Prices Paid~…households with only one household member pay 10% less for an item than households with family size greater than or equal to five (with a p-value of difference < 0.01).
176~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Single Parents and Prices Paid~…single females with no children pay 7% lower prices than married couples with children (with a p-value of difference < 0.01), while single males without children pay 4% lower prices than married couples with children (with a p-value of difference < 0.01); these differences persist after controlling for household income.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Family Composition~…households with larger families pay higher prices than households with smaller families.
176~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Amount of Goods Purchased~…it should be noted that a larger consumption basket increases the returns to shopping.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Family Composition~…it should be noted that a larger household size raises the cost of shopping.
176~D1, D2~L7~Variable Value~Full-Time Status~…indicates that an individual member of a household works at least 30 hours per week.
176~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Marital Status, Employment Status~…to explore whether married families in which both adults work at least 30 hours per week in the market differ from those in which only one spouse works in the market; however, the absence of a differential may reflect endogeneity of market labor.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…households that face greater time demands within the home may opt to have only one spouse work in the market, while those that do not face such heavy demands may have both spouses supply market labor; in this way, the opportunity cost of time may be uncorrelated with the labor status of a spouse.
176~D1, D2~F12~Findings~FTE Married Couples and Prices Paid~…among married-couple families, it is found that households in which neither spouse works more than 30 hours per week in the market pay, on average, 2% less for goods (p-value=0.04) than married-couple households in which at least one spouse works full-time; among all households, the difference is 1%, but the difference is not statistically significant (p-value=0.41).
176~D4~D4~Dataset~Census~…used to determine at what age the number of children in a married-couple household is greatest.
176~D4~T2~Time Period~2000.0~…survey year from which Census data is drawn.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…using the 2000 census, it is found that the number of children in a married-couple household is greatest when the head is around age forty.
176~V1, V9~L8~Variable Value~45-49~…wages of both males and females, conditional on working, peak around the age range of 45 to 49 years old.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…to the extent that labor force participation is declining in late middle age, the observed wages overstate the average cost of time for households in their fifties and sixities.
176~D3~V18~Variable~Wages~…wages for both males and females, conditional on working.
176~D3~V18~Variable~Wages~…drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data source.
176~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…wage data comes from the 1993 to 1995 cross-sections of this data source.
176~D1, D3~T1~Time Period~1993-1995~…relevant survey years from which Panel Study of Income Dynamics data is drawn.
176~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Middle Age and Prices Paid~…unconditional on marital status, households with heads aged 45 to 49 pay 7% higher prices than households with heads aged 25 to 29 (p-value < 0.01) and 4% higher prices than households with heads aged 65 and older (p-value < 0.01).
176~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Middle Age and Prices Paid Conditional on Marriage~…conditional on marriage, households with heads aged 40 to 44 pay 8% higher prices than households with heads aged 25 to 29 (p-value < 0.01) and 6% more than those with heads 65 and older (p-value < 0.01).
176~D1~V11~Variable~Product Category~…the category of a product purchased determined from the UPC codes.
176~V11~L9~Variable Value~Milk~…the most common product category purchased in the dataset.
176~D1~V12~Variable~Product Categories Purchased~…the number of product categories a household purchases per month, where a product category is a broad class such as milk, beer, orange juice, et.
176~D1~V11~Variable~Product Category~…product category is a broad class such as milk, beer, orange juice, et.
176~D1~V13~Variable~Varietal Purchases I~…the number of individual UPCs, or varieties, a consumer purchases per month.
176~D1~V7~Variable~UPC Code~…distinct varieties include a six-pack of pepsi, a twelve-pack of Pepsi, a six-pack of Diet Coke, etc.
176~D1~V13~Variable~Varietal Purchases I~…distinct varieties include a six-pack of pepsi, a twelve-pack of Pepsi, a six-pack of Diet Coke, etc.
176~D1~V13~Variable~Varietal Purchases I~…conditional on the number of product categories, number of varieties pruchased captures the propensity of a household to substitute brands or sizes.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Within-Household Price Dispersion~…within-household price dispersion tracks the change in price for the same good and the same household over time, using the panel dimension of the Homescan data.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Within-Household Price Dispersion~…for each household and each year, researchers compute the standard deviation of log price, good-by-good, and then average these standard deviations across all goods purchased by the household (equally weighted).
176~D1, D2, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Between-Household Price Dispersion~…for this measure, researchers take advantage of the cross-sectional dimension of the Homescan data.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Between-Household Price Dispersion~…to create this measure, shoppers are segmented into eight aggregated age ranges; for each UPC and each month, the standard devation of log prices is calculated across households in the same age category.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Between-Household Price Dispersion~…the measure of dispersion averages all the standard deviations of log price across all good-month cells within the age category.
176~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Shopper's Age~…aggregated into eight age ranges.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to ensure that the observed effects are not due to a changing basket of goods over the life cycle, later specifications of this model break out milk, a single category purchased by almost every household, and perform the same analysis on UPCs within this category.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…to ensure that the observed effects are not due to a changing basket of goods over the life cycle, later specifications of this model break out milk, a single category purchased by almost every household, and perform the same analysis on UPCs within this category.
176~D1, D2, D5~F15~Findings~Within-Dispersion Peaks and Troughs~…the within dispersion peaks in middle age and declines in retirement, dropping by roughly 20% to 40% (or 5 percentage points) from peak to trough.
176~D1, D2, D5~F16~Findings~Between Dispersion Peaks and Troughs~…the between dispersion drops by 33% to 50% between middle age and retirement.
176~D1~V14~Variable~Varietal Purchases II~…researchers also replace the number of UPCs as their measure of varieties with the number of brands (Coke, Pepsi, Miller, etc) within a product category a household purchases per month; this measure counts Coke and Pepsi as different varieties, for example, but does not distinguish between six-packs and twelve-packs of Coke.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…to examine time spent in shopping over the life cycle, data is used fom the 2003 American Time Use Survey, conducted by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…participants in this survey are drasn from the exiting sample (that is, the final outgoing rotation group) of the Current Population Survey.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…roughly 1,700 individuals complete the survey each month, yielding an annual sample of over 20,000 individuals.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…only one individual per household is sample; respondents in the sample, via a telephone survey, complete a detailed time diary of their previous day and then the Bureau of Labor Statistics staff aggregate the survey responses into time-use categories.
176~D2~V15~Variable~Time Spent Grocery Shopping~…one of two measures of time spent shopping, factoring only time spent shopping for grocery items.
176~D2~V16~Variable~Time Spent Household Shopping~…one of two measures of time spent shopping, factoring total time spent shopping for household items.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…researchers restrict the relevant sample to include only individuals betweent he ages of 25 and 75 years old.
176~V1, V9~L8~Variable Value~45-49~…households with heads in their mid-forties have the largest family sizes and, as a result, have the greatest shopping needs.
176~V1, V9~L10~Variable Value~65 and Older~…households in their post-retirement years have the lowest opportuntiy cost of time, and, therefore, shop most intensively for a given basket of goods.
176~V1, V9~L11~Variable Value~25-29~…households with young heads shop relatively little because they buy relatively few goods and have work and education demands on their time.
176~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Grocery Shopping to Total Shopping Over the Life Cycle~…the ratio of grocery shopping to total shopping is fairly constant at 25% to 30% over the life cycle.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Price Function~…researchers can undertake a more formal analysis of price paid by estimating a price function that maps shopping frequency and quantity purchased into the price paid.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Price Function~…the estimated elasticities calculated by this function will be used in the lifecycle model of consumption.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Price Function~…the function is dependent on the price index, the amount of time shopping, and the amount of goods purchased.
176~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Amount of Goods Purchased~…the amount of goods purchased per shopping trip at a specific date in time.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Price Function~…holding this variable constant, households that hsop more will reduce the price they pay, but these returns to shopping diminish as shopping increases; likewise, holding shopping time constant, households that purchase more goods pay higher prices.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…unforunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not have each spouse within the same household fill out a time diary; researchers construct synthetic married-couple households by summing over married men and women, based on the husband's age. Given that each age group contains a fairly large cross-section and that the Bureau of Labor Statistics randomly selects which spouse is recorded within a household, resaerchers feel that the bias from this approach is minimized.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this data allows for the calculation of the number of shopping trips undertaken by the household, but does not report the time spent per trip.
176~D1~V17~Variable~Trips Per Month~…because the Homescan data set does not report the time spent per shopping trip, resaerchers use trips per month as the measure of shopping time in the price function when using ACNielsen Homescan survey data.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Price Function~…because the Homescan data set does not report the time spent per shopping trip, resaerchers use trips per month as the measure of shopping time in the price function when using ACNielsen Homescan survey data.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…benchmark regressions take the amount of goods purchased to be evaluated at the mean prices; however, alternatives are also explored, such as the total number of product categories purchased and the variety of goods purchased.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…benchmark regressions take the amount of goods purchased to be evaluated at the mean prices; however, alternatives are also explored, such as the total number of product categories purchased and the variety of goods purchased.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…this method assumes that price is log linear in shopping frequency and quantity.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…this method assumes that price is a second-order polynomial in shopping time and a fifth-order polynomia in quantity; increasing the polynomial in shopping time beyond these orders has little effect on results.
176~D1, D2~F18~Findings~Shopping Frequency Elasticity~…the coefficient on the log of shopping frequency in the log-log regression is equal to -0.08 (p-value < 0.01), while a similar elasticity of -0.12 is obtained from ordinary least-squares regressions, evaluated at the sample average; in other words, the data from Homescan indicate that a doubling of the shopping frequency reduces prices paid by roughly 8% to 12%, conditional on the quantity purchased. Moreover, the positive coefficient on the second-order term in shopping frequency from the ordinary least-squares regression indicates diminishing returns to search.
176~D1~F19~Findings~Quantity Purchased and Prices Paid~…it is found that the quantity purchased has a statistically significant impact on price in both specifications with elasticities of 0.07 and 0.11, respectively; hat is, for a given shopping frequency, the more purchases a shopper makes, the higher the price paid for the average good.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…one concern with the benchmark specification of this model is that the quantity purchased may be a function of price; in turn, researchers re-estimate this regression including controls for the number of product categories and the number of varieties purchased; researchers instrument for log quantity, using income, while also including dummies for household size and composition as additional regressors.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Household Price Index ~…measures how much one pays for a given UPC good relative to what the average person pays; the fact that one can buy in bulk to reduce the price is not relevant here as the bulk good is treated as a different UPC-coded good.
176~D1~V6~Variable~Household Income~…used as an instrument for log quantity in later specifications of the log-log model.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Family Composition~…household size and composition may affect shopping efficiency and is correlated with the baseline regressors.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…one concern with the benchmark specification is that shopping frequency rather than shopping time; however, this distinction is immaterial if time per trip is constant across households. The American Time Use Survey data suggest that time per trip is not constant over the life cycle and in fat, frequency and time per trip are negatively correlated over the life cycle; in a univariate regression, this would bias the estimated elasticities with respect to time toward zero.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…this data source suggests that time per trip is not constant over the life cycle; in fact, frequency and time per trip are negatively correlated over the life cycle.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…data used to define two separate measures of home production.
176~D2~V19~Variable~Time Spent on Food Production~…one of two measures of home production that includes total time spent on food production, comprising meal preparation and meal clean-up.
176~D2~V20~Variable~Total Home Production~…one of two measures of home production that includes total home production, comprising food production, indoor clearning and chores, clothes care, outdoor maintenance, and lawn care.
176~V1, V9~L12~Variable Value~40-44~…home production time peaks for households with heads in their early forties, because holds with heads in their early forties have the greatest home production needs (that is, the larges family sizes).
176~V1, V9~L10~Variable Value~65 and Older~…home production time peaks again for households with heads who are 65 and older, because households with heads 65 or older have the lowest opportunity cost of time.
176~D2~F20~Findings~Food Production and Total Home Production~…over the life cycle, the ratio of time spent in food production to time spent in total home production is roughly constant, at approximately 28%.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…shopping data can be used to estimate the shadow value of the opportuntiy cost of time.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…the household's cost minimization problem is a function of the amount of time spent shopping, the quantity of market goods pruchased at a specific price, the amount of time devoted to home production and the price of time.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…for the elasticity of substitution of the home production function, one need only to assume weak separability; in particular, it is only needed to assume that the ratio of marginal products does not vary with other goods or uses of time. 
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…the cost minimization problem does not depend on whether the goods in question are separable in utiity with other consumption goods or leisure; however, it is only needed to assume that the current price function and home production function for food are adequately captured by the data set.
176~D1, D2, D4, D5~DV17~Derived Variable~Price Function~…the cost minimization problem does not depend on whether the goods in question are separable in utiity with other consumption goods or leisure; however, it is only needed to assume that the current price function and home production function for food are adequately captured by the data set.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…the opportunity cost of time for the shopper is hump-shaped over the life cycle and differs from that of wages for either males or females; specifically, the shopper's cost of time rises faster than wages in the early thirties, but then is relatively flatter through middle age, before declining sharply.
176~D3~V18~Variable~Wages~…reported wages are condtional on working and are, therefore, not directly information regarding the unemployed or those out of the labor force.
176~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Marginal Rate of Transformation~…first-order conditions imply that the marginal rate of transformation between time and market goods in shopping equals the marginal rate of transformation in home production.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…the availability of this price data is crucial to estimating the home production function.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…the current approach requires only that the opportunity cost of time for the shopper equals the opportunity cost of time for the home producer.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…the home production function has a constant elasticity of substitution between time and market goods.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…the function is allowed to be homogeneous of arbitrary degree, although this parameter will not be able to be identified.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this price data does not contain time spent in production; however, to get around this issue, researchers merge this data with data from the American Time Use Survey, by creating demographic cells in both data sets, using age, sex, marital status, and education.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…researchers merge Homescan data with data from the American Time Use Survey, by creating demographic cells in both data sets, using age, sex, marital status, and education.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…merged demographic cells from both the Homescan and American Time Use Survey data sets, using age, sex, marital status, and education.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…researchers use eight age ranges, four education categories, two marital status categories, and two gender categories.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…the demographic variables are those reported for the houeshold head.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…adjusting for the fact that not all combinations are represented, there are a total of 92 separate cells.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…for each cell in the American Time Use Survey data set, researchers calculated the sample average of time spent in food production and total home production and merge this ito the homescan data set.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…aggregated into eight age ranges when deriving demographic cells.
176~V1, V9~L11~Variable Value~25-29~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L13~Variable Value~30-34~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L14~Variable Value~35-39~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L12~Variable Value~40-44~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L8~Variable Value~45-49~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L15~Variable Value~50-54~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L16~Variable Value~55-64~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~V1, V9~L10~Variable Value~65 and Older~…one of eight aggregated age ranges for the head of household or shopper.
176~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Education~…aggregated into four education categories when deriving demographic cells.
176~V4~L17~Variable Value~Less Than High School~…one of four aggregated education levels for the head of household.
176~V4~L18~Variable Value~High School~…one of four aggregated education levels for the head of household.
176~V4~L19~Variable Value~Some College~…one of four aggregated education levels for the head of household.
176~V4~L20~Variable Value~College or More~…one of four aggregated education levels for the head of household.
176~D1, D2~V22~Variable~Marital Status~…aggregated into two categories when deriving demographic cells.
176~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Sex~…aggregated into two categories when deriving demographic cells.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Between-Effects Regression~…note that while researchers have variation at the household level for price and quantity, the measure of time use varies only according to demographic cells; therefore, each cell is collapsed and ran with a between-effects regression.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…averaging over a number of household in each demographic group should reduce the errors-in-variables inherent in the relevant data; this averaging will also correct for idiosyncratic productivity shocks that are uncorrelated with demogarphics.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…the constraint is imposed that all demographic cells face the same producting ffunctions; this may be problematic to the extent that the quantity of home capital may vary across cells.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…contains dummy variables for presence of home durables including microwaves, dishwashers, garbage disposals, etc.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…when analyzing over the home production function, inclusion of dummy variables for durables does not alter the results and therefore, specifications are reported without these controls, given the desire to preserve degrees of freedom.
176~D1, D2~F21~Findings~Elasticity of Substitution and Demographic Cells~…using information from the 92 demographic cells yields an estimate of the elasticity of substitution to equal 1.2, with a standard error of 0.1 in log-log specifications on home production; in this case, one can reject the hypothesis of an elasticity of q at standard confidence levels.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…while the baseline log-log model of home production uses the food production measure of home production time, certain specifications of the log-log model on home production perform the same analysis of the 92 demographic cells using the borader measure of time spent in home production.
176~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Total Home Production and Elasticity of Substitution~…when the broader measure of home production is implemented, an estimate of substitution elasticity is found to be 1.3 with a standard error of 0.1; in this case, one can reject the hypothesis of an elasticity of q at standard confidence levels.
176~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Demographic Cells~…some of the demographic cells have few households, with the minimum number of observations per cell being equal to six.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…one of the concerns with the baseline and expanded specifications of the log-log model is that some of the demographic cells have few households.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Between-Effects Regression~…to correct for the fact that some of the demographic cells have very few households, researchers run a between-effects regression on home production, using the eight age groups as the cells.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4~F23~Findings~Between-Effects Results and Elasticity of Production~…when researchers run a between-effects regression using the eight age groups as cells, an elasticity of 2.5 is found for food production and 2.7 for total home production, both with standard errors of 0.2.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…aggregated into eight age ranges as cells in order to correct for few household representation in some of the 92 demographic cells; these cells are much larger than the demographic cells, with a minimum observation count per cell of 2,449.
176~D1, D2~F24~Findings~Elasticity of Substitution Between Home and Market Goods~…researchers report an elasticity of substitution between home and market goods of 1.5 for single, employed women.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…in order to determine whether including quantity on both the right- and left-hand sides of the log-log regressions on home production is a problem, researchers estimate variation that only includes log quantity on the right hand side; in this case, the log of home production time is the only outcome of interest.
176~D1, D2~F25~Findings~Log-Log Regressions and Home Production Elasticity~…when variation of the home production log-log regressions are run with log quantity on the right-hand side only and only log home production on the left-hand side, the estimate of the substitution elasticity is equal to 2.5, with a standard error of 0.5, a result roughly the same as that found in previous specificaitons.
176~D1~F26~Findings~Right-Hand Side Log Quantity Coefficient~…the estimated coefficient on the log of quantity when this variable is restricted to the right-hand side is 1.0 with a standard error of 0.3.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…with a parametrized home production function, researchers can compare how lifecycle expenditure (an input into the home production function) compares with lifecycle consumption (an ouput of the home production function).
176~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Average Price Per Trip~…an input into the home production function.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…the output of the home production function.
176~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Returns to Scale~…going from the Marginal Rate of Transformation to levels requires the assumption of a value for returns to scale, which is taken to be 1.
176~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Marginal Rate of Transformation~…the denominator is set equal to 1 when estimating a parametrized home production function.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…household consumption has a twin peaks shape.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…consumption rises rapidly early in the adult lifecylce, peaking around 40, then declines until late middle age before rising through retirement.
176~D1, D2~F27~Findings~Household Consumption Peak by Age Group~…household consumption's peak for houesholds with heads in the late thirtes is 26% higher than that for households headed by adults 25 to 29 (p-value < 0.01), 9% higher than that of households with heads in their early fifties (p-value = 0.08), and 3% higher than that of the households with heads in their sixties (p-value = 0.50).
176~D1, D2, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Implied Consumption to Expenditures~…plotted to control fro changing family size over the life cycle.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Implied Consumption to Expenditures~…note that any proportional scaling factor due to changing household size is accounted for by this ratio.
176~D1, D2~V23~Variable~Household-Level~…consider a household comprised of two adults; where no index is used, this implies that aduls have been summed across to report a household-level variable.
176~D1, D2, D4~V24~Variable~Household Age~…the age of the household is denoted by a single index which runs from zero, when the household is formed, through a single point at which the adult members of the household die.
176~D1, D4~DV20~Derived Variable~Number of Children, Age~…at a certain age, the household also includes a level of children of a specific age.
176~D1, D4~DV20~Derived Variable~Number of Children, Age~…dependent on the age-t household's vector of number of children at a specific age
176~D1, D4~DV20~Derived Variable~Number of Children, Age~…the arrival of children is taken to be exogenous.
176~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Preferences~…agents have preferences over consumption and leisure and seek to maximize total discounted utility over the life cycle.
176~DV1~L21~Variable Value~Household Food Consumption~…the household food consumption as a function of preferences.
176~DV1~L22~Variable Value~Household Other Consumption~…the household consumption of other goods as a function of preferences.
176~D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Leisure~…the leisure time for a specific individual as a function of preferences.
176~D1, D2~V25~Variable~Intertemporal Discount Factor~…the intertemporal discount factor as a function of preferences.
176~DV1~L21~Variable Value~Household Food Consumption~...consumption is the product of the home production function that was estimated for a subset of goods, namely food items captured by Homescan; it is assumed that utility is separable in food and other goods allowing to model in partial isolation decisions regarding food expenditures and time spent shopping for and preparing food.
176~D2~V19~Variable~Time Spent on Food Production~...consumption is the product of the home production function that was estimated for a subset of goods, namely food items captured by Homescan; it is assumed that utility is separable in food and other goods allowing to model in partial isolation decisions regarding food expenditures and time spent shopping for and preparing food.
176~DV1~L22~Variable Value~Household Other Consumption~…the purchase of other goods and time spent shopping or other goods enter only through the budget constraints.
176~D2~V20~Variable~Total Home Production~…the purchase of other goods and time spent shopping or other goods enter only through the budget constraints.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Family Composition~…this vector enters as a taste shifter implemented by defining the number of adults in the household and the number of children at a specific age.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV23~Derived Variable~Relative Weight of Consumption~…the relative weight in consumption of a child of a certain age to an adult.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV23~Derived Variable~Relative Weight of Consumption~…a specification of adult equivalencies.
176~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Returns to Scale~…a parameter capturing the returns to scale in household consumption.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…exhibits constant returns to scale.
176~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~EIS for Consumption~…the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption included in an iso-elastic utility function for consumption.
176~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~EIS for Leisure~…the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in leisure included in an iso-elastic utility function for leisure.
176~D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint for Time~…as the focus is on shopping and home production - margins that can more plausibly be adjusted freely - we endow an adult in a household of any age at a total of units of time that can be allocated to shopping, home production, and leisure; the remaining time is exogneously commited to market work, childcare, sleep, personal care, etc.
176~D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint for Time~…researchers have scaled up time spent shopping for and home producing food to account for the corresponding time devoted to other goods.
176~D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint for Time~…given that labor income is exogenous, the budget constraint can be collapsed to be dependent on the net present value of labor income plus any initial assets, the share of expenditures on food, and researchers have made explicit the assumption that price is given by the shopping function.
176~D1, D2~DV27~Derived Variable~NPV of Labor Income Plus Assets~…the net present value of labor income plus any initial assets as included in calculating the budget constraint.
176~D1, D5~DV28~Derived Variable~Share of Food Expenditures~…the share of expenditures on food as included in calculating the budget constraint.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…household consumption is greatest when the cost of time is lowest.
176~V1, V9~L10~Variable Value~65 and Older~…household consumption is greatest when the cost of time is lowest; that is, adjusted for family size and impatience, consumption is highest inretirement.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…total expenditures in terms of time and money are then constant multiples of expenditures on food.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…holding price and its parameter constant, expenditures increases with the price of time if 1 divided by the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption is less than the elasticity of substitution; the intution behind this relationship is the following: an increase in the price of time provides an incentive to purchase more market goods and less time as inputs into home production for a given level of consumption, however, the total cost of consumption is relatively high when time is scarece, providing an incentive to reduce consumption (and market goods as an input) in those periods.
176~D1~V8~Variable~Price of Good~…in the current framework, researchers allow the price of goods to vary with the cost of time.
176~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Shopper's Opportunity Cost of Time~…in the current framework, researchers allow the price of goods to vary with the cost of time.
176~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~EIS for Consumption~…a relatively low elasticity of intertemporal substitituion for consumption and the changin cost of time directly imply a hump in expenditures over the life cycle; this driven solely by the opportunity cost of time and the ability to substitute time for expenditure in shopping and home production.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…the well known lifecycle hump in expenditures is present for food expenditures from the Homescan data.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…the model overpredicts expenditures early in the life cycle by a few percentage points, and, therefore, the model's hump is slightly shallower than the data's.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…the model captures the dramatic decline in expenditures in later middle age and retirement; this decline is a combination of declining family size and the falling opportunity cost of time.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Implied Consumption to Expenditures~…for comparison purposes, researchers include the consumption-to-expenditure ratio as found in the data, evaluated using the calibrated home production parameters.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…for the model, consumption is calculated using the calibrated home production function plus the predicted inputs of market fgoods and time.
176~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Home Production Function~…used to calculate consumption in the estimation model.
176~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Household Consumption~…in both the data and the model, consumption is relatively low in middle age and high late in life; this reflects both the intratemporal and intertemporal margins of substitution as time is at a premium in middle age, and agents will therefore substitute toward market goods along any consumption isoquant, lowering the ratio of consumption to expenditure, and because consumption is cheap when time is cheap, agents will accordingly substitute away from consuming in middle age and towards consuming in retirement.
176~D1, D2, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Ratio of Implied Consumption to Expenditures~…time is at a premium in middle age, and agents will substitute toward market goods along any consumption isoquant, lowering the ratio of consumption to expenditure.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…when the estimated elasticities for the shopping and home production function are fed into the model, the model yields lifecycle profiles for shopping and home production that match the empirical patterns quite closely.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…when the estimated elasticities for the shopping and home production function are fed into the model, the model yields lifecycle profiles for shopping and home production that match the empirical patterns quite closely.
176~D1, D2~F28~Findings~Parameterization A I~…the elasticity of substitution between time and goods in home production is lowered from 2.5 to 1.1 when elasticities in the home production and shopping functions are lowered by roughly one half.
176~D1, D2~F29~Findings~Parameterization A II~…the elasticities of price with respect to shopping time and goods purchased are lowered to -0.05 and 0.10, from -0.11 to 0.21, respectively, when elasticities in the home production and shopping functions are lowered byu roughly one-half.
176~D1, D2~F30~Findings~Parameterization B~…altering the adult equivalence scales to specify that all children, regardless of age, are considered to be equivalent to 0.5 adults in consumption, and setting the returns-to-scale parameter to 1, raises the expenditure early in the life cycle, which ultimately lead to higher prices paid.
176~D1, D2~F31~Findings~Parameterization C~…raising the intertemporal elasticities of substitution for consumption leisure to 0.67 leads to households becoming more willing to delay consumption until retirement, when time is cheap. The ratio of consumption to expenditure during retirement remains high relative to its value in middle age, but it is slightly lower than in the benchmark; the increased level of expenditures leads to higher prices during retirement relative to the benchmark.
176~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Log~…regressions used to estimate the elasticity between time and money due to shopping and home production.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this data source is limited in the sense that it only consists of a subset of grocery items and, in turn, cannot state whether similar patterns hold for other goods.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…this data suggests that households shop and engage in home production for nonfood goods. 
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…within this data, the average monthly expenditure for packaged goods scanned is $176 per month, expressed in current dollars.
176~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…within this data, the average exenditures on food at home is $323 per month.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…this data does not include meat, fresh foods, or vegetables.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…it may be the case that households fail to scan all grocery items in the Homescan database; on average, a household reported 1% lower expenditure in the first quarter of 1994 than it did during the first quarter of 1993, and 5% lower expenditure in the first quarter of 1995 compared with the same quarter in 1994. The failure to record all transactions is not crucial to many of the facts regarding price dispersion documented in this paper, as long as the transactions a household does record are representative of that household's purchases; however, the failure to record all transactions may influence such items as total expenditures and frequency of shopping. When results are estimated for each of the analyses with only the first quarter of the Homescan survey sample with those obtained using the sample from the last quarter, researchers did not uncover substantial differences.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…within the data set, roughly two-thirds of the households are present for at least 16 months of the survey, and over half remain for the entire 27 months.
176~D1, D2, D5~F32~Findings~Expenditure Regression and Demographic Categories~…in a regression of the month-to-month decline in expenditure on age and time dummies, the p-value of the test that all seven age dummies are zero is 0.44, while in a regression of the month-to-month decline in expenditure on education and time dummies, the p-value of the teset that all five education categories are zero is 0.78.
176~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…in order to compare expenditures in Homescan data with those in this panel data, researchers created cells for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics respondents by age of head, education, and year.
176~D3~DV29~Derived Variable~Comparable Demographic Cells~…demographic cells used in order to compare expenditures in Homescan data with those in the panel data.
176~D3~DV29~Derived Variable~Comparable Demographic Cells~…respondents are sorted by eight age categories, four education categories, and three year categories. 
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…the age of the head of household distincted into eight aggregated categories and used in deriving comparable demographic cells for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data source.
176~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Education~…four aggregated education categories used in deriving comparable demographic cells for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data.
176~D3~V26~Variable~Year~…three year dummies used in deriving comparable demographic cells for the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data.
176~V26~L23~Variable Value~1993.0~…one of three year dummies used in order to sort Panel Study of Income Dynamics respondents into comparable demographic cells.
176~V26~L24~Variable Value~1994.0~…one of three year dummies used in order to sort Panel Study of Income Dynamics respondents into comparable demographic cells.
176~V26~L25~Variable Value~1995.0~…one of three year dummies used in order to sort Panel Study of Income Dynamics respondents into comparable demographic cells.
176~D1, D5~V27~Variable~Total Food Expenditures~…for each comparable demographic cell, researchers calculated the average expenditure on food at home reported in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and then merged these values into the Homescan dataset.
176~D1, D3~DV30~Derived Variable~Homescan/PSID Ratio~…researchers use the merged food expenditures data to construct the ratio between Homescan households and their corresponding Panel Study of Income Dynamics cells.
176~D1, D3~F33~Findings~Homescan Survey vs. Panel Study of income Dynamics~…the gap between the Homescan survey and Panel Study of Income Dynamics data shows no correlation with the age of the household head (the p-value of the F test is 0.56).
176~D1, D3~F33~Findings~Homescan Survey vs. Panel Study of income Dynamics~…reported expenditure in Homescan for households with a college-educated head is, on average, 42% of that reported in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, while the comparable share for high school graduates is 55% (p-value of difference < 0.01); this suggests that households with more-highly educated heads are less likely than others to scan all purchases (or that these individuals buy more goods outside the scope of Homescan, such as meat and produce).
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…one issue with this data set is that the Denver metropolitan area is treated as a single market; it may be the case that there is extensive market segmentation due to income, age, and family composition.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…within the data, 83.6% of purchases were made at grocery stores, 4.1% were purchased at discount stores, 3.1% at price clubs, 1.7% at convenience stores, and 1.5% at drug stores; the remaining purchases occurred at specialty stores, including liquor stores, gas stations, vending machines, pet stores, etc.
176~D1~V7~Variable~UPC Code~…the quality of a purchase may not be perfectly proxied by this UPC code. For example, high-income individuals may shop at high-end crocery stores because the store displays are nicer or because they have access to a wider variety of high-quality goods. The higher price for a specific UPC good at such a store may be the result of better store amenities; however, the nature of the Homescan suggests that this is not an issue as 85% of all products purchased at grocery stores were purchased within four grocery chains of similar quality.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…85% of all products purchased at grocery stores were purchased within four grocery chains of similar quality: Albertsons, King Sooper, Safeway and Cubs Food.
176~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Head of Household Age~…when households consist of two adults, researchers focus on the age of the male head as the empirical counterpart of this variable, where the lifecycle begins at 25 and ends at age 81.
176~D1, D4~V28~Variable~Annual Interest Rate~…set to 2% throughout the analysis.
176~D2~V29~Variable~Time Inverse Parameter~…set equal to the inverse of 1 plus the interest rate, or 0.98; this implies that agents would like to maintain constant marginal utilities of consumption and liesure over the life cycle, all else being equal.
176~D1, D2~DV24~Derived Variable~EIS for Consumption~…this parameter is set to 5, or an EIS of 0.2, which is in line with many empirical estimates.
176~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~EIS for Leisure~…the labor literature implies a plausible estimate of this parameter to be 3; that is, a 1% increase in the price of time induces a 0.33% increase in leisure.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…in this data sample, market hours for married men aged 25 to 55 is slightly higher than reported leisure hours.
176~D2~F34~Findings~American Time Use Survey Market Hours~…in the American Time Use Survey data, market hours for married men aged 25 to 55 is slightly higher than reported leisure hours, implying a Frisch labor elasticity evaluated at the mean of roughly 0.2. For women, reported time spent in market labor is less than time spent in leisure implying a labor supply aelasticity closer to 0.4.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Family Composition~…the household consists of two adults plus children placed into three groups.
176~D1, D4~DV20~Derived Variable~Number of Children, Age~…the household consists of two adults plus children placed into three groups.
176~DV20~L26~Variable Value~0-5 years~…an age range for which a child may be divided into.
176~DV20~L27~Variable Value~6-12 years~…an age range for which a child may be divided into.
176~DV20~L28~Variable Value~13-18 years~…an age range for which a child may be divided into.
176~D1, D4~DV20~Derived Variable~Number of Children, Age~…the number of children in each age range is calibrated to the life cycle of married-couple households reported in the 2000 Census.
176~D4~D4~Dataset~Census~…the number of children in each age range is calibrated to the life cycle of married-couple household reported in the 2000 Census.
176~D1, D2, D4~DV23~Derived Variable~Relative Weight of Consumption~…given scant guidance from the literature, researchers somewhat arbitrarily set the relative consumption weights to 0.1, 0.5, and 1, for the three age ranges of children.
176~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Returns to Scale~…resaerchers set the returns to scale parameter equal to 0.9, which implies mild positive returns to scale to household size.
176~D5~D5~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…researchers set the expenditures share parameter to match the ratio of average expenditure in the Homescan database and total nondurable expenditures reported it he Consumer Expenditure Survey.
176~D1~D1~Dataset~ACNielsen's Homescan~…researchers set the expenditures share parameter to match the ratio of average expenditure in the Homescan database and total nondurable expenditures reported it he Consumer Expenditure Survey.
176~D2~F35~Findings~American Time Use Survey Home Production Time~…data from the American Time Use Survey indicates that the mean time spent home producing food is roughly one-quarter to one-third of total time spent on housework.
176~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Marginal Rate of Transformation~…the scale parameter is calibrated so that the MRT between time and goods in shopping equals that in home production when evaluated at the empirical means of shopping time, home production time, and market goods purchased for households with heads aged 40 to 44 with a resulting value of 0.9.
176~D2~D2~Dataset~American Time Use Survey~…the endowment of time for each adult is obtained from the American Time Use Survey.
176~D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint for Time~…for each age, reseachers take the sum of time allocated to home production, shopping, and leisure for married men and women and average across households.
177~Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social Security Administrative Records~~~~
177~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
177~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Draft Eligibility~…in each lottery, priority for induction was determined by a Random Sequence Number from 1 to 365 that was assigned to birthdates in the cohort being drafted, whereas men were called for induction by a Random Sequence Number up to a ceiling determined by the Defense Department, and only men with lottery numbers below the ceiling could have been drafted.
177~D2~V1~Variable~Ceiling~…the ceiling determined by the Defense Department in which all men below a certain Random Sequence Number were eligible for being drafted.
177~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Draft Eligibility~…if draft eligibility is correlated with veteran status but uncorrelated with other variables related to earnings, then earnings differences by draft-eligibility status can be attributed to military service.
177~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Service Proportion~…the proportions of draft-eligible and draft-ineligible men who actually served in the military is used to convert estimates of the effect of draft eligibility into estimates of the effect of military service.
177~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Service Proportion~…the assumptions underlying this procedure are those that justify instrumental variables estimation; in principle, any function of the Random Sequence Number provides a legitimate function for Veteran Status.
177~D1, D2, D5~F1~Findings~White Veteran Relative Earnings After Ten Years ~…white veterans earn approximate 15% less than nonveterans as much as ten years after their discharge from the military.
177~D1, D2, D5~F2~Findings~White Veternal Earnings Loss Equivalent~…earnings loss to white veterans is equivalent to a loss of 2 years of civilian labor market experience.
177~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1944-1950~…the 1970 draft lottery covered 19- to 26-year old men born in 1944-1950, although most of the men drafted in 1970 were born in 1950.
177~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1951.0~…the 1971 draft lottery covered 19- to 20-year old men born in 1951.
177~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1952.0~…the 1972 lottery covered men born in 1952.
177~D1, D2~T4~Time Period~1970-1975~…draft years, however no one was drafted after 1972, and congressional conscription authority expired in July 1973.
177~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Draft Eligibility~…Random Sequence numbers were randomly assigned in a televised drawing held a few months before men reaching draft age were to be called.
177~D2~V1~Variable~Ceiling~…draft-eligibility ceilings, 195 in 1970, 125 in 1971, and 95 in 1972, were announced once Defense Department manpowere needs were known leading many men with low numbers to volunteer for the military to avoid being drafted and to improve their terms of service.
177~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Draft Eligibility~…only the initial selection process was based on Random Sequence Number order, as subsequent selection from the draft-eligible, nondeferred pool was based on a number of criteria including pre-induction physical examination and a mental aptitude test.
177~D1, D2~T5~Time Period~1970.0~…the last year in which men over the age of 20 were drafted.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…all analysis is restricted to men who turned 19 in the year they were at risk of induction, as veterans born from 1944-1949 who managed to avoid service until 1970 may not constitute a representative sample.
177~D1, D2~T6~Time Period~1950-1953~…the relevant birth year period for this research paper as all individuals who turned 19 in the year they were at risk of being eligible for the Vietnam War draft.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…earnings data used in this study is drawn from the Social Security Administration's Continuous Work History Sample, a one percent sample drawn from all possible Social Security Numbers.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…includes two earnings series, the first of which contains information on the 1964 to 1984 earnings of men in employment covered by FICA up to the Social Security taxable maximum, while also including FICA taxable earnings from self-employment, and the second of which contains total compensation as reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 excluding earnings from self-employment.
177~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure I~…utilizes information on the 1964 to 1984 earnings of men in employment covered by FICA up to the Social Security taxable maximum while also including taxable earnings from self-employment.
177~D1, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure II~…beginning in 1978, utilizes total compensation data as reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, excluding earnings from self-employment.
177~D1~T7~Time Period~1964-1984~…earnings series from which the Continuous Work History Sample reports earnings of men in employment covered by FICA up to the Social Security taxable maximum and FICA earnings from self-employment.
177~D1~T8~Time Period~1978-1984~…earnings series from which the Continuous Work History Sample reports earnings as total compensation as reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2, excluding earnings from self-employment.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the original Continuous Work History Sample does not contain information on date of birth, however Social Security Administration Programmers matched date of birth variables to this dataset in a special extract created for this proect.
177~D2~D2~Dataset~Semiannual Reports of the Director of Selective Serivce~…data from 1969 to 1973 that compiles a source of lottery numbers that were matched to dates of birth in the Continuous Work History Sample.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the Social Security Adminstration limits disclosure of data collected for tax purposes and, in turn, could only release aggregate data.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the aggregate data set contains sample statistics for cells, defined by year of earnings, year of birth, race, and five consecutive lottery numbers.
177~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Cell Statistics~…include means, variances, fraction with earnings equal to the taxable maximum, fraction with earnings above the taxable maximu, fraction with zero earnings, and number of observations in each cell.
177~D2~V2~Variable~Lottery Numbers~…a set of five consecutive lottery numbers that determine eligibility for draft induction in a certain year.
177~D1~V3~Variable~FICA Taxable Earnings~…reported for draft lottery participants between 1950 ad 1953 with specification for draft-eligible men, and for men with lottery numbers that exempted them from the draft.
177~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure I~…all earnings are in 1978 dollars.
177~D1, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure II~…all earnings are in 1978 dollars.
177~D3~D3~Dataset~The Economic Report of the President~…the deflator used for all tabulations is the Consumer Price Index on page 313 of the Economic Report of the President, 1988.
177~D1, D2, D3, D5~F3~Findings~Draft Eligibility and Earnings Profiles~…the impact of draft eligibility on earnings profiles is striking as there appears to be no difference in earnings until the year of conscription risk in the draft lottery; subsequently, the earnings of draft-eligible white men born in 1950 to 1952 fall below the earnings of draft-ineligible white men born in 1950-1952, while the earnings of draft-eligible nonwhites also fall below the earnings of other non-whites, but the gap appears to narrow and become positibve for some nonwhite cohorts in later years, a finding that is possibly a consequence of the random assignment of draft eligibiliy as the only thing that distinguishes a draft-eligible man from a draft-ineligible man is the higher conscription risk faced by eligible men after the lottery.
177~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~FICA and W-2 Earnings Losses for Draft-Eligible Men~...estimates of the effect of draft eligibility show that the loss in FICA earnings to draft-eligible white men is sometimes stasticially significant and amounts to 2% to 3% of earnings, while estimated W-2 earnings losses are similar but tend to be larger and morevariable than the estimated losses in FICA earnings.
177~D1, D2, D3, D5~F5~Findings~Draft Eligibility and Probability of Taxable Maximum for Nonwhites~…the effect of draft eligibility on nonwhites' probability of being at the taxable maximum, although imprecisely measured, appears to go in the same direction as the effect of draft eligibility on mean earnings, a result that is worth noting because, when the effect of draft eligibility on the probability of being censored has the same sign as the effect on earnings, estimates tabulated using censored data tend to underestimate the truth effect.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…estimates of the effects of military service are based on a simple linear model for earnings, where earnings is the outcome, and explanatory variables include a cohort effect, a period effect common to all cohorts, and a residual.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…the coefficient of interest in this model is the effect of military service on civilian earnings.
177~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure I~…as the outcome of an ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effects of military service.
177~D1, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure II~…as the outcome of an ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effects of military service.
177~D1, D5~V4~Variable~Cohort Effect~…the fixed effect for a specific birth cohort.
177~D1, D5~V5~Variable~Period Effect~…a period specific fixed effect that is common across all cohorts.
177~D1, D5~V6~Variable~Veteran Status~…a binary variable indicating whether or not an individual is a military veteran.
177~D1, D5~V6~Variable~Veteran Status~…the main coefficient of interest on this variable in regressions estimating the effects of military service on civilian earnings will not be consistently estimated by Ordinary Least Squares if this variable is correlated with the unobserved components of the earnings equation.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…the draft lottery facilitates estimation of this equation because functions of randomly assigned lottery numbers provide instrumental variables that are correlated with veteran status, but orthogonal to the error term.
177~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Draft Eligibility~…an instrumental dummy variable that equals one if the individual is draft eligible.
177~D1, D2, D3, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Military Status on Earnings~…the main coefficient of interest in all Ordinary Least Squares regressions on the effect of Military Status on Earnings estimated by the mean earnings for draft eligible samples minus the mean earnings for draft-ineligible samples all divided by the proportion of the draft eligible cohort entering the military minus the proportion of the draft ineligible cohort entering the military.
177~D1, D2, D3, D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Military Status on Earnings~…simply adjusts earnings differences by draft-eligibility status for the fact that not all draft-eligible men actually served in the military, while some men who were not draft eligible voluntarily enlisted for service; the justification for estimation of the effects of military service in this manner is clear in that it is assumed that nothing other than differnces in the probability of being a vertan is responsible for differences in earnings by draft-elibility status.
177~D1, D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Service Proportion~…implementation of the Wald estimator requires estimates of the proportion of active eligible and ineligible men entering the military.
177~D4~D4~Derived Variable~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…sourced from a special version of the 1984 survey year in order to tabulate the service proportion by eligibility status through being matched to an indicator of draft-eligibility status from information on birthdates included in the Census Bureau's in-house version of this data file.
177~DV2~L1~Variable Value~Proportion of Active Eligible Men ~…because a small number of observations are available for single-cohort statistics, each Survey of Income and Program Participation estimate is actually the average for three consecutive cohorts.
177~DV2~L2~Variable Value~Proportion of Active Ineligible Men~…because a small number of observations are available for single-cohort statistics, each Survey of Income and Program Participation estimate is actually the average for three consecutive cohorts.
177~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Difference in Service Proportion~…shows the difference in the probability of military service by draft-eligibility status.
177~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Conversion Rule of Thumb~…estimates of the effect of draft eligibility on veteran status for whites born 1950 to 1952 range from 0.10 to 0.16, thus a rule of thumb for conversion of draft-eligibility treatment effects into estimates of the effects of military service is to multiply by 1/0.15 = 6.67.
177~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…the sample is restricted to the subset of whites born 1950 to 1952 because the results suggeset that this is the group for whom draft eligibility is most likely to be a useful instrument, while earnings variables are for 1981 to 1984 because the impact of military service in these years represents a long-term effect.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the sample is restricted to the subset of whites born 1950 to 1952 because the results suggeset that this is the group for whom draft eligibility is most likely to be a useful instrument, while earnings variables are for 1981 to 1984 because the impact of military service in these years represents a long-term effect.
177~D1~T9~Time Period~1950-1952~…birth cohort from which the Wald estimate sample is drawn from as results suggest that this is the group for whom draft eligibility is most likely to be a useful instrument.
177~D1~T10~Time Period~1981-1984~…time period from which earnings variables are drawn for Wald estimates of the effect of military service on selected cohorts because the impact of military service in these years represents a long-term effect.
177~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure I~…used in the numerator of the Wald estimator to present estimates for FICA earnings effects.
177~D1, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure II~…used in the numerator of the Wald estimator to present estimates for W-2 earnings effects.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…used in the numerator of the Wald estimator to present estimates for censored FICA earnings effects.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…an earnings series constructed by applying a simple non-parametric correction for censoring to the FICA earnings data in which data are adjusted for censoring by using the fraction with recorded earnings at the taxable maximum, combined with mean earnings above the taxable maximum estimates from Current Population Surveys, to estimate population mean earnings from censored mean earnings.
177~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…source of data used to calculate mean earnings above the taxable maximum of Social Security data in order to estimate population mean earnings from censored mean earnings.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Wald Estimated Annual Earnings Loss for Veterans~…Wald estimates for adjusted FICA earnings indicate that white veterans suffered annual earnings loss of roughly $2000 constant (1978) dollars of $3,500 current dollars, an amount that is approximately 15% of annual W-2 compensation for white men between 1981 and 1984.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D6~M2~Methodology~Wald Estimator~…the Wald estimator is based solely on earnings differences by draft-eligibility status.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D6~M2~Methodology~Wald Estimator~…the use of a draft indicator variable and a constant as instrumental variables leads to the following estimator for the military effect on earnings equal to the proportion mean eligible earnings minus the mean ineligible earnings divided by the proportion of the eligible cohort entering the military minus the proportion of the ineligible cohort entering the military.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…a more efficient estimator that exploits all the information on Random Sequence Numbers in the aggregate data by fitting the Ordinary Least-Squares earnings model to observations on mean earnings for each group of five consecutive lottery number. 
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…where the outcome is mean earnings for members of a cohort at a specific time with lottery numbers in a specific group, and explanatory variables are cohort effects, period effects, the fraction of a cohort with specific lottery numbers who served and an unobservables term.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…genearlizes Wald's method to grouped data with more than two groups.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Cohort, Lottery Number, Service~…the fraction of a cohort with lottery numbers in a certain group who served.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…estimates using this method may easily be shown to have an instrumental variables interpretation; in this case, the instrument set includes dummy variables that indicate groups of five consecutive lotter numbers for each race, cohort, and year of earnings with a total of 73 dummy variables for a particular race, cohort, and year.
177~D1, D2, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Lottery Numbers, Race, Cohort and Year of Earnings~…a group of 73 dummy variables for a particular race, cohort, and year where the first indicates men with lottery numbers 1 through 5 and the 73rd indicates men with lottery numbers 360-365.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…the quadratic form minimized by this estimator is an overidentification test statistic associated with the use of dummy variables as instruments, a statistic that tests the exclusion of lottery number group dummies from the Ordinary Least-Squares equation.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…the estimates are simply coefficients from regressions of mean Social Security earnings on estimates of the fraction of a cohort with lottery numbers in a certain group who served.
177~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…this data sample is too small to allow accurate estimation of a full set of the fraction of a cohort with lottery numbers in a certain group who served.
177~D6~D6~Dataset~Defense Manpower Data Center~…a source of administrative data used to derive a second set of probabilities on the fraction of a cohort with lottery numbers in certain group who served.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…data on cohort size used to estimate a second set of probabilities on the fraction of a cohort with lottery numbers in a certain group who served.
177~D6~D6~Dataset~Defense Manpower Data Center~…briefly, this data shows the total number of new entrants to the military by race, cohort, and lottery number from July 1970 through December 1973.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Cohort, Lottery Number, Service~…Defense Manpower Data Center and Continuous Work History Sample data are used to estimate this variable by first counting the number of entrants to the military by race, cohort, and lottery number interval, numbers which categorize the numerator of this variable
177~D1, D6~V8~Variable~Number of Entrants to the Military by Race~…used in order to derive the cohort, lottery number, service variable.
177~D1, D6~V9~Variable~Number of Entrants to the Military by Cohort~…used in order to derive the cohort, lottery number, service variable.
177~D1,  D6~V10~Variable~Number of Entrants to the Military by Cohort~…used in order to derive the cohort, lottery number, service variable.
177~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Overall Cohort Sized~…estimates of the overall cohort size, to be used in the denominator of the cohort, lottery number, service variable are derived from the Continuous Work History Sample
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Cohort, Lottery Number, Service~…estimates of the overall cohort size, to be used in the denominator of the cohort, lottery number, service variable are derived from the Continuous Work History Sample
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…because this data is a one percent sample, if the sampling frame is identified with the population at risk, an estimate of total cohort size is simply 100 times the Continuous Work History Sample cohort size.
177~D1, D2~L1~Derived Variable~Proportion of Active Eligible Men ~…to estimate the probability of being a veteran conditional on being draft eligibile, the number of draft-eligible men in the Defense Manpower Data Center data is divided by 100 times the number of men in the Continuous Work History Sample data with lottery numbers below the induction ceiling.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Cohort, Lottery Number, Service~…inaccuracy of the Defense Manpower Data Center data and Continuous Work History Sample data estimates for 1950 is a consequence of the fact that Defense Manpwer Data Center administrative records are unavailable before July 1970, therefore, despite the limitations of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, this data must be used to construct probabilities for the 1950 cohort.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…for each race and year, the sample used to estimate this equation includes 73 cell means for each of the three cohorts born from 1951 to 1953, plus two cell means for the 1950 cohort.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…used to show the relationship between probabilities of veteran status and mean W-2 compensation in 1978 dollars between 1981 and 1984.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F8~Findings~Generalized Least Squares Regression Slope~…in esimating the Generalized Least Squares equation, the slope of the least squares regression line drawn through the points is -2,384 with a standard error of 778, and is the estimate of the effect of military status on civilian earnings measures.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…there are 221 points plotted in the figure: 4 years of earnings times 3 cohorts with 73 cells plus 4 years of earnings times one cohort with 2 cells (men born in 1950) = 884, divided by four to compute the average over years.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…estimation of this equation is the same as instrumental variables estimation of the Ordinary Least Squares equation using dummy variables as instruments; however, inference for the case where the estimation strategy is implemented by regressing Continuous Work History Sample mean earnings on Defense Manpower Data Center data over Continuous Work History Sample data probabilities or Survey of Income and Program Participation probabilities is complicated by the use of data from mulitiple samples, but assuming that the samples used to calculate mean earings and the sample used to calculate probabilities are independent, the optimal Two-Sample Instrumental Variables estimator is applicable.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV12~Derived Variable~Two-Sample Instrumental Variable~…includes a vector of mean earnings, a vector of service probabilities, and a vector of unobservables, where theta in parentheses represents the dependence of residuals on the parameter vector and V( ) denotes the covariance matrix of the argument.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV12~Derived Variable~Two-Sample Instrumental Variable~…the minimized value of this variable is an overidentification test statistic for the validity of dummy variables as instruments.
177~D1, D4, D5~T10~Time Period~1981-1984~…earnings period through which the two-sample instrumental variable estimates are presented in 1978 dollars.
177~D3~T11~Time Period~1978.0~…base earnings year from which the Consumer Price Index adjusts for
177~D1, D4, D5~F9~Findings~White Veterans Earnings Loss~…white veterans born from 1950 to 1952 suffered an annual earnings loss of between $1,500 and $2,100 constant (1978) dollars.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Generalized Least Squares~…adjusted with Two-Sample Instrumental Variables and separated into two models including Model 1, which allows the effect of veteran status on earnings to vary by cohort, and Model 2, which restricts estimated service effects to be the same across cohorts.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F10~Findings~Model 1 vs. Model 2 Estimates~…although many of the estimates for individual cohorts in Model 1 are not significant, the combined estimates for whites in Model 2 are substantially larger than twice their standard errors, while in contrast, results for nonwhites show no evidence of a statistically significant earnings loss to veterans.
177~D1, D2, D3, D5~F11~Findings~Overidentification Test Degrees of Freedom~…the overidentification test statistics reported in Table 4 take on values less than their degrees of freedom, suggesting that the residuals in the Ordinary Least Squares equation are not correlated with lottery-based instruments.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~DV13~Derived Variable~Degrees Of Freedom~…degrees of freedom for the overidentification tests are calculated as follows: for each race, the data consist of four years of earnings for three cohorts with 73 lottery number cells each and the fourth cohort, men born in 1950, has four years of earnings with 2 lottery number cells each, giving a total of 884 cells or, equivalently, 884 categorical instruments. Model 1 includes 4 cohort dummies, 3 year dummies, and 4 treatment effects from which 884 minus 11 parameter gives 873 degrees of freedom, and Model 2 includes only 8 parameters leading to 876 degrees of freedom.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the earnings function motivated by the theory of human capital is log-linear in years of schooling.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M5~Methodology~Log-Quadratic~…the earnings function motivated by the theory of human capital is log-quadratic in years of abor market experience.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…adapting the human capital earnings function for the problem at hand, the earnings of an individual in a specific cohort at a specific time may be written where the outcome is the log of earnings and explanatory variables include a time-varying intercept, parameters, the civilian labor market experience of a man, the deviation of schooling from the sample mean level of schooling for a man, the number of years of military experience for veterans and a dummy variable indicating military service.
177~D1, D2, D4, D5, D6~V11~Variable~Time Varying Intercept~…a time varying fixed effect included in regressions run on the log of earnings.
177~D1, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Experience~…the civilian labor market experience of a man specified for cohort and time period as included in the log-linear regressions.
177~D1, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Experience~…equal to the time minus the cohort plus 18 minus the deviation of schooling from the sample mean level of schooling and the service indicator variable times the years of military experience
177~D1, D5~V12~Variable~Deviation of Schooling~…the deviation of an individual's schooling from the sample mean level of schooling used to derive experience..
177~D1, D2, D6~V13~Variable~Military Experience~…the number of years of military experience for veterans used to derive experience.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…focusing on parameters that can be estimated using Social Security data the log-linear earnings equation may be rewritten assuming that schooling does not vary by lottery number and that schooling is independent of cohort.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…using dummy instrumental variables to group this equation by cohort, year, and lottery number, average log earnings for members of a cohort at a specific time can be altered where time varying intercepts now include the period mean.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…a generalization of the log earnings model allows the linear experience term to vary with veteran status.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the variations of these models parametrize a time-varying veteran status coefficient as a linear function of labor market experience.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…does not contan the mean of log earnings.
177~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure I~…if earnings are approximately lognormally distributed, use of the log of the mean will provide a reasonable approximation.
177~D1, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure II~…if earnings are approximately lognormally distributed, use of the log of the mean will provide a reasonable approximation.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…if earnings are approximately lognormally distributed, use of the log of the mean will provide a reasonable approximation.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the sample used to estimate these equations begins in the fifth year after the lottery in which members of the cohort were drafted allowsing for three years of service and one year of readjustment to civilian life.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…evidence from previous regressions suggests that the veteran effects are essentially zero for the 1953 cohort, so it was excluded from the estimation.
177~D1, D2, D4, D5~F12~Findings~Loss of Experience for Military Veterans~…the loss of experience estimated using log-linear regressions with dummy instrumental variables is approximately 2 years, suggesting that military experience may be a partial substitute for civilian experience.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F13~Findings~Loss of Earning for Veterans Decay to Zero Point~…the reduced form estimates of the log-linear regressions imply that the loss of earnings to veterans decays to zero around age 50 with a standard error of 16.
177~D1, D6~V14~Variable~Veteran Status~…important to identify as the effect of veteran status can only be estimated for those who served in the armed forces.
177~D1, D6~V14~Variable~Veteran Status~…if veterans are more or less likely to benefit from military service than the rest of the population, then the estimated veteran status coefficient does not characeterize the impact of veteran status on a random sample.
177~D1, D2, D3~M5~Methodology~Random Coefficients Model~…the problem that if veterans are more or less likely to benefit from military service than the rest of the population, then the estimated veteran status coefficient does not characterize the impact of veteran status on a random sample is formalized in the random coefficients model for treatment effect heterogeneity including the effect of military service on the earnings of a specific person.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…contains no information on covariates other than race and age, a fact that may be of concern if the impact of veteran status is primarily through its effect on covariates.
177~D1, D2, D3, D5~F14~Findings~Annual Earnings Loss~…the annual earnings loss to white veterans is on the order of $3,500 current dollars, or roughly 15% of yearly wage and salary earnings in the early 1980s, while in contrast, the estimated veteran effects for nonwhites are not statistically significant.
177~D1, D2, D4, D6~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…although Ordinary Least Squares regressions usually show that the effect of World War II veteran status is large, positive, and significant, these results may actually be a consequence of selection bias; however, by exploiting the fact that World War II veteran status is also correlated with exact date of birth, researchers have implemented an instrumental variables estimation strategy  similar in spirit to the one used here.
177~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F15~Findings~External Validity to World War II~…the results of implemeting an instrumental variables estimation strategy similar in spirit to the one used in this research paper lead to external validity with World War II veterans as the impact of veteran status in this war is no larger than zero and may well be negative.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the Social Security Administration maintains the earnings histories of covered employees in a data base known as the Summary Earnings Record and approxmiately one year after these records have been updated with the latest year's earnings, a one percent sample of earnings histories is extracted where the sampling frame consists of al issued Social Security numbers, and the sample is stratified using the regional information coded in the numbers.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…prior to 1978, the FICA taxable earnings of employees were reported to the Social Security Administration by employers on a quarterly basis.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…self-employed workers report their earnings annually on schedule SE of Internal Revenue Service Form 1040.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…since 1978, employers have no longer been required to make quarterly reports; instead they file IRS form W-2 with the Social Security Administration on an annual basis.
177~D1~T11~Time Period~1978.0~…period after which all earnings, including those above the FICA taxable maximum, are to be reported to the Social Security Administration on form W-2.
177~D1~T12~Time Period~pre-1978~…period where FICA taxable earnings were reported to the Social Security Administration by employers on a quarterly basis.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…two shortcomings of this dataset include the facts that many employers do not report the earnings of those engaged in non-FICA taxable employmen and that the W-2 series is the poor quality of the data during the first years of annual reporting.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…FICA coverage includes most wage and salary and self-employment earnings, but for the sample period used in this research period, the most important coverage exceptions are the majority of federal civilian employees, some state and local government employees, some agricultural and domestic workers, and the employees of some nonprofit organizations; an external figure by Robert Meyer for state, local, and civilian federal government employees imply that by 1981, roughly 58% of all civilian government workers were covered.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the combined effects of limited coverage and censoring at the taxable maximum are conveniently summarized by the perentage of all earnings that are reported to the Social Security Administration; these statistics show that after 1981 over 90% of wage and salary earnings and over 75% of self-employment earnings were reported to the Social Security Administration.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…the W-2 earnings series excludes earnings from self-employment.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…in this data source, information on race and sex is obtained from a computerized record of applications for a Social Security number called the NUMIDENT file, where for this projects, dates of birht were also matched from this file.
177~D2~D2~Dataset~Semiannual Reports of the Director of Selective Serivce~…draft lottery numbers from this data source were matched to the Continuous Work History Sample using lottery number tables for 1963 to 1973.
177~D2~T13~Time Period~1969-1973~…period from which all lottery number data was drawn in this research.
177~D1~D1~Dataset~Continuous Work History Sample~…a small number of individuals were discarded from the final data set because there was no information on either their sex, race, or exact date of birht.
177~D1, D5~F16~Findings~Zero FICA Earnings Proportion~…descriptive statistics indicate that after 1972 the fraction of men in the sample with zero FICA earnings varies roughly between 15% and 22% for whites and between 33% and 36% for blacks.
177~D1, D5~F17~Findings~Taxable Maximum Proportion~…descriptive statistics indicate that the fraction with FICA earnings at the taxable maximum is more variable than the fraction with zero earnings, ranging from 3% to 15% for whites and between 2% to 10% for blacks.
177~D1~V3~Variable~FICA Taxable Earnings~…the FICA earnings of men with multiple employers can exceed the taxable maximum because reported earnings are censored by source, with the fraction of men with FICA earnings above the taxable maximum being around 1 to 2%.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…the FICA earnings series is adjusted for censoring by applying a formula, involving the mean of uncensored earnings, the mean of censored earnings, the mean of earnings above the taxable maximu, the taxable maximum and the fraction with earnings at or above the taxable maximum, using estimates of each earnings mean tabulated from the March Current Population Surveys for each year, race and cohort.
177~D1~V15~Variable~Taxable Maximum~…the taxable maximum annual earnings as determined by the Social Security Administration.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…this formula ignores the fact that the censored earnings of men with multiple employers may be above the taxable maximum.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…this formula may be used to analyze the bias in treatment effects estimated from censored data.
177~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~ …the March Current Population Surveys are used to estimate the means of uncensored earnings and censored earnings for each year, race, and cohort.
177~D1, D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Earnings Measure III~…although this procedure involves no parametric distributional assumptions, the adjustment is only approximate because the Current Population Survey estimates of the mean earnings do not vary by lottery number; however, the adjustment does incorporate variation in the fraction with earnings at or above the taxable maximum.
177~D1, D5~V15~Variable~Fraction Above Taxable Maximum~…incorporated into the Earnings Measure III with variation by lottery number.
177~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data on earnings above the FICA taxable maximum are taken from the Mare-Winship March Current Population Survey Uniform files.
177~D1, D5~V16~Variable~Cohort~…birth cohorts were determined on the basis of age in 1985.
177~DV16~L3~Variable Value~1950.0~…those that were ages 34 to 35 in 1985 were assigned to the 1950 birth cohort.
177~DV17~L4~Variable Value~1951.0~…those that were ages 33 to 34 in 1985 were assigned to the 1950 birth cohort.
177~DV18~L5~Variable Value~1952.0~…those that were ages 32 to 33 in 1985 were assigned to the 1950 birth cohort.
177~DV19~L6~Variable Value~1953.0~…those that were ages 31 to 33 in 1985 were assigned to the 1950 birth cohort.
177~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this dataset reports wage and salary earnings in the year preceding the survey year.
177~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to compute the adjusted 1981 to 1984 earnings series, data from the Current Population Surveys for 1982 through 1985 were used to compute separate mean earnings by cohort and race for each year.
177~D5~D5~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…it should be noted that Current Population Survey earnings data are also censored at $75,000 for 1981 to 1983 earnings and at $100,000 for 1984 earnings.
177~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…a Census Bureau longitudinal survey of approximately 20,000 households in the civilian noninstitutional population.
177~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…data for the first wave of the first panel of this survey were collected from four rotation groups in 1983 and 1984.
177~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…this source contains year and month of birth and also information on day of birth, which is not directly released to the public.
177~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Draft Eligibility~…was determined by the official Random Sequence Number ceiling for men born from 1944 to 1952 and by Random Sequence Number for men born in 1953.

178~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Limited Information Model~…this paper presents a model of limited information where the imperfect substitutability between different brands may arise from limited consumer information about product offerings as well as from idiosyncratic brand preferences.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Limited Information Model~…this model incorporates three important sources of consumer heterogeneity: choice sets, tastes, and advertising media exposure.
178~D1, D2~F1~Findings~PC Industry Median Markups ~…the researcher finds high estimated median markups in the Personal Computer industry in 1998, about 19%, whereas traditional full information models suggest the industry was more competitive, with estimated markups of only 5%.
178~D1~D1~Dataset~Gartner Inc.~…the product level data was provided by Gartner Inc. and consists of quarterly shipments and dollar sales of all personal computers sold between 1996 and 1998, where all prices are dollar sales dividied by units sold.

178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Logit~…this paper considers a model of random choice sets, where the probability that a specific consumer purchases a specific product depends upon the probability that she is aware of the product, the probability that she is aware of the other competing products, and the probability that she would buy the product given her choice.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M3~Methodology~Logit~…assuming consumers are aware of the outside option with probability 1, the condition probability that a specific consumer purchases a specific product depends on the set of all choice sets that include the product, the probability that the consumer is informed about the product, the presence of the outside good, and the outside sum over all the choice sets that include the product.

178~D4~D4~Dataset~Competitive Media Reporting~…there is not enough variation in the advertising data to estimate parameter effects for all media separately and, in turn, these parameters are estimated for the television medium and for the combination of newspaper and magazine media.
178~V10~L6~Variable Value~Group Advertising Expenditures~…the parameters on group advertising are identified by observed variation in expenditures on group advertisements with the number of products in the group and by functional form.

178~D1, D2, D4, D5, D6~F3~Findings~Instruments and Endogeneity~…both sets of instruments appear to address the endogeneity of price issues and result in estimates for the price coefficient that are significantly higher in absolute value, while other parameter estimates are similar across specifications, with an exception being the sign change on the coefficient for laptop, a finding that is consistent with the idea that price is endogenous as laptops are more portable and hence better, all else constant, and certainly demand a higher price.
178~D1, D5, D6~F4~Findings~Mean CPU Speed and Laptop Effects~…the means CPU speed and laptop are positive and significant at 9.288 and 1.236, respectively, suggesting that CPU speed and laptop have a signicant positive effect on the distribution of utility.
178~D1, D5, D6~F5~Findings~Marginal Valuation for CPU Speed~…the marginal valuation for CPU speed is significantly increasing in household size at 4.05, a finding that is intuitive as children often use the personal computer to play games, which requires higher CPU speeds.
178~D1, D5, D6~F6~Findings~Pentium Dummy Coefficients~…coefficients for Pentium dummy, 1.236, are not significant at the 5% level, suggesting that one you control for CPU speed and other product attributes, consumers do not place extra value on whether the chip is a Pentium; this finding comes during a period where 80% of personal computers had a pentium chip.
178~D1~F7~Findings~Firm Fixed Effect and Marginal Valuation for a Product~…firm fixed effect estimates indicate that the marginal valuation for a product is significantly higher if it is produced by Apple, Dell, IBM, or Packard-Bell with significant coefficients of 3.070, 2.658, 2.514, and 4.372, respectively; because apple operates on a different platform, so Apple fixed effects could reflect the extra valuation consumers, on average, place on the Apple platform, or these findings could capture extra valuation consumers place on enhanced services offered by the firms or other reputational effects.
178~D1, D2, D5, D6~F8~Findings~Cost and Non-Home Sector Estimates~…when estimating cost and non-home sector estimates, the only variable with an unexpected sign is Pentium with a coefficient of -0.25 indicating that personal computers with a Pentium chip are cheaper to produce.
178~D1, D2, D4~F9~Findings~Log Price of Advertising~...the coefficient on the log price of advertising is highly significant at 1.051 indicating that there are not many product-specific cost characteristics that affect the cost of advertising.
178~D1, D2, D4, D5~F10~Findings~Non-PC Computer Sales and IBM Advertisment~…the coefficient on non-personal computer sales, 3.688, is positive and signficant at the 5% level, but the interaction term between IBM and advertising in the information technology, 0.9, indicates that advertising by IBM is still more effective relative to some other firms, after controlling for non-PC enterprises; if the IBM fixed effect in the information technology were not significantly different from zero, the researcher could have concluded that the presence of IBM in the non-personal computer sector fully explained their large advertising expenditures.
178~D5, D6~DV20~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…these coefficients when measured against media exposure proxy for effectiveness of advertisments in reaching consumers through various media types.

178~D1, D4, D5, D6, D8~F12~Findings~Newspapers and High Income Married Individuals~…newspapers are the most effective at reaching high income, married individuals whoare above the age of 30, although newspaper advertising is less likely to reach a family the larger is their household with a coefficient of -0.04.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6, D7~F13~Findings~Television Advertising and Married Individuals over 50~...television advertising is also effective at reaching married individuals over 50, although not as effective as newspapers with a coefficient of 0.09.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6~F14~Findings~Low Income and Product Information~…the coefficient on income less than $60,000, 0.69, indicates these individuals are likely to be informed about 41% of the products without seeing an ad, whereas having a high income is not significantly different from having a middle income in terms of being informaed without seeing an ad, an finding that could arise because low income individuals are likely to have lowere opportunity costs and thus more time to search for information.
178~D1, D4, D5~F15~Findings~Length on Market and Information~…consumers are significantly more likley to know a personal computer the longer it has been on the market with a coefficient of 0.16, a finding that is intuitive for the longer it has been on the market, the more opportunity consumers hav ehad to learn of it by word-of-mouth or through advertising.
178~D1, D4, D5~F16~Findings~Decreasing Returns by Media Type~…there are decreasing returns to advertising in the television, -0.05, and newspapers and magazines, -0.01, media, but they are decreasing at a faster rate for television media.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6~F17~Findings~Firms w/ Effective Advertisement~…ads by Compaq, Dell, Gateway, IBM, and Packard-Bell are significantly more effective with coefficients of 0.504, 0.497, 0.918, and 0.926, respectiveluy suggesting that some firms are more effective at informing consumers through advertising.
178~D1, D4, D5~F18~Findings~Economies of Scope in Group Advertising~…there are economies of scope in group advertising with a coefficient of 0.1, with estimates implying that if average group ad expenditures for a particular product group are above a threshold level of $1.05 million per quarter (either the expenditures for a group are high or the groups are small), the firm will find it worthwhile to engage in group advertising to capitalize on the economies of scope. To put this into context, in the first quarter of 1998 Apple's advertising strategy involved 17 group advertisements; the estimates suggest we would observe 17 group ads only if Apple's home sector advertising budget was at least $18 million. Apple spent over $180 million in advertising in 1998 and more than $20 million in the first quarter, a fact consistent with the model's prediction.
178~D4, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Media Exposure Moments~…from media exposure decisions, which match the model's predictions for exposure to a specific type of media to observed exposure.
178~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Firm Choice Moments~…the Simmons survey data is effective in constructing firm choice moments with the 15 original firms used in estimation.
178~D1, D2, D4, D5~F19~Findings~Market Share Elasticity for Dell Latitude~…an increase of $1,000 for advertising on Dell Latitude results in an increased market share of 0.02%.
178~DV47~L10~Variable Value~Semi-Elasticities~…each semi-elasticity gives the percentage change in the market share of the row computer associated with a $1,000 increase in the estimated advertising of the column computer; for instance, a $1,000 increase in advertising for Apple Power Mac results in a decreased market share of around 0.1% for Compaq Presario, buy has very little effect on the maket share for Apple Power Book.
178~D1, D2, D4, D5~F20~Findings~Median Markup vs. Marginal Costs, Per-Unit Production, and Estimated Advertising Costs~…the median markup charged by personal computer firms is 15% over marginal costs of production and 10% over per unit production and estimated advertising costs.
178~D1, D2, D4~F21~Findings~Non-Top vs. Top Firm Median Markup~…the non-top firms' average median markup is much lower than the top firms by 12%, with an ad-to-sales ratio of about 2%.
178~D1, D2, D4~F22~Findings~Median Industry Markup: Total and Top-Firm Only~…in 1998 the median industry markup was 19% over costs, with the top firms earning a 22% markup.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M8~Methodology~BLP Model~…a benchmark BLP model which allows the examination of the additional markup firms earn as a result of limited consumer information.
178~D1, D2, D4~F23~Findings~BLP Model Estimated Median Markups~…the BLP model estimates indicate that median markups would be 5% under full information, one-third the magnitude of those under limited information.
178~DV47~L11~Variable Value~Demand-Elasticities~…the greater the number of competitors or the larger the cross-elasticity of demand with the products of other firms, the tgreater the elasticitiy of the firm's demand curve and the less its market power.
178~D1, D2~F24~Findings~Elasticity Nonrandom Distribution~…the elasticity results suggest that limited information about a product is a contributing factor to differences in purchase outcomes and information is distributed across households in a nonrandom way.
178~DV47~L11~Variable Value~Demand-Elasticities~…median own-price elasticity minus 100.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M8~Methodology~BLP Model~…this model can match the dat through one of two ways: through the i.i.d. error term or through unobserved product characteristics.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M8~Methodology~BLP Model~…since mean utility is chosen to match market shares, the model will force product 1's mean utlity to be lower.
178~D1, D2~F25~Findings~Traditional Model Overestimated Elasticities~…the estimated limited information markups for PowerBook G3 are on the order of 11% while the BLP estimates suggest this is a product with low markups of around 1%, suggesting that traditional models, which rule out nonrandom information assymmetries across households and products a priori, yield inconsistent estimates for product-specific elasticities that are biased toward being too elastic.
178~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Firm Choice Moments~…from purchase decisions, which match the model's predictions for the probability individuals purchase from a specific firm to observed purchases.
178~D1, D2, D5, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Quarterly Income~…quarterly income was constructed from annual data and deflated using the Consumer Price index.

178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M9~Methodology~Modified BLP Model~…a modification of the BLP model proposed by Bajari and Benkard (2005; hereafter BB) in which they estimated personal computer demand and found high estimated own-price elasticities and indenpendently attributed their unrealistically high estimates to the full information assumption.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6~F27~Findings~Limited Information and UN Model Miss-Rate~…the limited-information model misses about 3% of the time, while UN misses more than twice as much, 8%, where most of the misses for both models are among Apple products (2.4% for the limited information model and 8% for UN), while both models' predictions match the data for Hewlett-Packard and Packard-Bell.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6, D7~F28~Findings~Limited Information and UN Model TV Advertisement Miss-Rate~…both the limited-information model and the UN model miss 1.5% and 5.5% of the time among TV advertisements.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6~F29~Findings~Limited Information and UN Model Miss-Rate for Apple and Compaq Products~…both limited-information models and UN models miss less than 1% on average, with all the misses coming among Apple and Compaq products.

178~D1~F30~Findings~BLP Pseudoshares for Top Firms, IBM, and Apple~…the BLP model's predicted pseudoshares do not come within 10% of the observed market shares for any of the top firms, while the Apple shares are within 5% of the observed shares and IBM within 10%.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M8~Methodology~BLP Model~…for all models, the researcher simulated a 1% increase in the price of all inside goods and calculated the percentage change in total home market share.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M9~Methodology~Modified BLP Model~…for all models, the researcher simulated a 1% increase in the price of all inside goods and calculated the percentage change in total home market share.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Limited Information Model~…for all models, the researcher simulated a 1% increase in the price of all inside goods and calculated the percentage change in total home market share.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Limited Information Model~…this method restricts attention to the top ten firms plus five other small firms, a sample selection that could effect esetimated margins in two ways: first, the smaller products not included in the sample are likely to have higher own-price elasticities and hence lower markups and second the fewer products that are included among the inside goods, the lower will be estimated markups for the inside goods.
178~D1, D2, D4, D5~F31~Findings~Modified BLP Product-Specific Demand Elasticities~…the modified BLM model found estimated product-specific demand elasticities ranging from -4 to -72, with a median elasticity of -11 for their modified model.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M10~Methodology~Monte Carlo~…used in order to test if the benefits of simulating choice sets are worth the costs of increased computation time.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M10~Methodology~Monte Carlo~…considers a market consisting of two products and one outside good.
178~D1, D2, D4~DV24~Derived Variable~Market Share~…the specification for market share is not separately identifiable from a model in which advertising enters the utility function directly.
178~D1, D2, D4~F32~Findings~BLP Full Information Median Markup~…a BLP full information model yields modest estimated median markups of 5%.
178~D1, D2, D4~F33~Findings~Limited Information Model and Median Markups in the PC Industry~…when estimating a model of limited consumer information, where firms provide information through advertising, the researcher found estimated median markups in the personal computer industry of 19% over production costs in 1998, where the top firms engage in higher than average advertising and earn higher than average markups.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6~F34~Findings~Limited Information Model and Significant Market Power of Firms~…results suggest that firms have significant market power due in part to limited consumer information.
178~D1, D4, D5, D6~F35~Findings~Heterogeneity in Consumers' Choice~…the results suggest that allowing for heterogeneity in consumers' choice sets yields more realistic estimates of substitution patterns between goods, assuming full information may result in incorrect conclusions regarding the intensity of industry competition, and that firms benefit from limited consumer information.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M4~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the full information linear model has an estimating equation computing the first difference in market share with the inclusion of optimal instruments.
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M8~Methodology~BLP Model~…uses an approach that makes greater use of the functional form of equilibrium prices 
178~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Limited Information Model~…to construct derivates for the limited information the researcher constrcuts initial instruments for prices and advertising, uses the initial instruments to obtain an initial estimate of the parameters, construct estimates of marginal costs, solve the first order conditions for equiliibrium advertising, solve the first-order conditions of the model for equilibrium prices, and these solutions imply a value for predicted market shares, this implication gives the unobservables evaluated at the exogenous predictions to calculate the required disturbance-parameter pair derivatives, then these steps are repeated where each time the new initial price is replaced by the price from the previous round to form approximations to the optimal instruments by taking the average of the exogeneous derivatives.
178~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Product Characteristics~…include price and nonprice observed attributes as well as attributes unobserved to the researcher but known to consumers and producers.
178~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Media and Markets~…Simmons survey data was used to test whether media exposure is endogenous to the purchase decision.
178~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Media and Markets~…these data include information on whether the individual purchased a personal computer, demographic characteristics, and media exposure information.
178~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Product Characteristics~…the researcher does not include brand fixed effects as there are over 200 brands.
178~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Product Characteristics~…the characteristics of a product sold in the non-home sector are price and other observable characteristics including advertising, CPU speed, and non-personal computer firm sales.
178~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Product Characteristics~…adequately addressing the issue of endogenous product characteristics would require a dynamic model of the process that generates product characteristics, a topic that is beyond the scope of this paper.
178~DV52~L12~Variable Value~Newspaper Access~…cost of access to newspaper media is averaged within 12 geographic regions.
178~D8~D8~Dataset~Audit Bureau of Circulations~…data source on access prices for over 140 magazines and over 100 newspapers in 1996 and 1997.
178~DV52~L13~Variable Value~Television Access ~…the resarcher uses two measures of the cost of access to cable including the monthly fee  for basic cable and the monthly fee for expanded basic cable.
178~DV52~L13~Variable Value~Television Access~…in some geographic regions, consumers can purchase pay service stations at an additional fee, however since these pay service stations are typically commerical-free, the researcher doesnot include the additional monthly fee associated with pay service access.
178~D7~D7~Dataset~Television and Cable Factbook~…cable price data from the Television and Cable Factbook for the years 1996 and 1997 in which data on access prices were gathered for over 250 cable carriers in 12 geographic regions.

178~D1, D4, D5, D7~F36~Findings~Low Income Individuals and Top 40% of Exposure to Television~…low income individuals are more likely to be in the top 40% of exposure to television, where these individuals are less likely to be in the top quintiles for newspaper or magazine readership.
178~D1, D4, D5, D8~F37~Findings~Newspaper Price Coefficient~…the price coefficient for newspaper is positive with a coefficient of 0.372, possibly reflecting the higher quality and prices of newspapers read by individuals in the top quintiles of Simmons data.
179~179: Litigation Costs and Returns to Experience~~~~
179~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
179~D1~V1~Variable~Litigation Costs~…the main focus of this research paper is to examine the question as to whether antidiscrimination protections may redistribute employment outcomes among members of protected groups by studying the relationship between litigation costs and returns to experience for members of protected groups.
179~D2, D3~V2~Variable~Returns to Experience~…the main focus of this research paper is to examine the question as to whether antidiscrimination protections may redistribute employment outcomes among members of protected groups by studying the relationship between litigation costs and returns to experience for members of protected groups.
179~D1~V1~Variable~Litigation Costs~…increases in maximum damage awards associated with employment discrimination lawsuits affect wages by making workers who are likely to sue more costly to employ.
179~D2, D3~V3~Variable~Wages~…as impacted by litigation costs, as increases in maximum damage awards associated with employment discrimination lawsuits affect wages by making workers who are likely to sue more costly to employ.
179~D1~V1~Variable~Litigation Costs~…the key issue in linking increases in litigation costs to changes in returns to experience is therefore whether the increase in litigation costs is greater for experienced or inexperienced workers.
179~D2, D3~V2~Variable~Returns to Experience~…the key issue in linking increases in litigation costs to changes in returns to experience is therefore whether the increase in litigation costs is greater for experienced or inexperienced workers.
179~D1~V1~Variable~Litigation Costs~…the effect of increases in litigation costs on returns to experience depends crucially on how employees' propensity to file employment-discrimination litigation conditional on employment varies with experience, and how the increase in propensity to  sue conditional on employment varies with experience.
179~D2, D3~V2~Variable~Returns to Experience~…the effect of increases in litigation costs on returns to experience depends crucially on how employees' propensity to file employment-discrimination litigation conditional on employment varies with experience, and how the increase in propensity to  sue conditional on employment varies with experience.
179~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Propensity to Sue~…used to determine how employees' propensity to file employment-discrimination litigation conditional on employment varies with experience.
179~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Propensity to Sue~…used to determine how the increase in propensity to sue, stemming from an increase in litigation costs, conditional on employment varies with experience.
179~D1, D2, D3~T1~Time Period~1991.0~…the year in which the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed on November 21, a federal employment discrimination legislation which protected racial minorities, females, and those with disabilities from workplace discrimination by allowing employees to sue for up to $300,000 in punitive damages, allowing those unlawfully terminated on the basis of race to sue for unlimited punitive damages, and gives either side in a suit the right to a jury trial.
179~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Propensity to Sue~…identifying relationships between the propensity to sue as a function of age and changes in the returns to experience among protected workers around the time of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…annual data on demographics from the 1988 to 1996 in order to determine aggregate employment and wage effects as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
179~D2~T2~Time Period~1988-1996~…survey period from which annual demographics data is drawn from in the Current Population Survey in order to determine the impacts of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
179~D1, D2, D3~T1~Time Period~1991.0~…the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 led to three provisions that may have affected the willingness of displaced employees to file race- and gender-based discrimination lawsuits including increased damage award available to plaintiffs, jury trial availability, and ease for plaintiffs to use statistical evidence to prove discrimination.
179~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Maximum Damages~…the maximum damage award available to individuals unlawfully terminated, varying by employer size and type of discrimination.
179~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Employer Size~…used in order to determine the maximum damages available for individuals unlawfully terminated based on discrimination ranging from $0 for firms with fewer than 15 employees to $300,000 for firms with more than 500 employees.
179~D1~V8~Variable~Racial Discrimination~…a binary variable in order to indicate whether the case is based on racial discrimination in order to determine whether there is a bound on the amount of damages.
179~D1~V1~Variable~Litigation Costs~…the right to a jury trial as granted by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 increases the costs of displacing workers for employers due to the fact that juries are perceived to favor claims of individuals rather than corportations and because jury trials increase the legal costs associated with defending against employment-discrimination lawsuits.
179~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Civil Rights Act of 1991 Impact on Propensity to Sue~…the number of lawsuits filed federal court shows that the number of cases alleging employment discrimination more than doubled from 1991, while the number of race- and gender-based complaints filed with the EEOC increased by 13% and 46%, respectively, from 1991 to 1994 and the monetary benefits awarded in cases resolved by the EEOC increased by 47% and 87%, respectively, over that period.
179~D2, D3~V3~Variable~Wages~…termination-based protections increase the costs associated with hiring a protected employee, as the increased costs are felt only if the employee is hired and then terminated.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…of all gender- and race-based complaints filed with the EEOC between 1992 and 1996, 58% claimed wrongful termination, 5.6% were for discriminatory hiring, with the rest based on on-the-job practices such as unequal pay, denial of promotion, or harassment, figures that actually overstate the importance of hiring cases as approximately 10% of hiring-based complaints also charge wrongful termination and may not have been registered had it not been for termination.
179~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Period~…a discrete-time, overlapping generations setting in which potential workers live for two periods, assuming that a worker can be employed in both periods of his life by any of a series of infinitely lived firms.
179~V9~L1~Variable Value~2nd Period~…researchers refer to workers in their first and second periods of life as inexperienced and experienced, respectively.
179~V9~L2~Variable Value~1st Period~…the beginning of the first period of a worker's life, the worker receives job offers from firms, compares these offers to his reservation wage, and decides whether to accept a job.
179~D2, D3~V10~Variable~Reservation Wage~…a wage that workers compare their first set of job offers in the initial period of their life to, a wage which is assumed to be zero.
179~D1~V11~Variable~Reason for Termination~…a worker who accepts employment may be fired for either of two reason.
179~V11~L3~Variable Value~Supervisor Discrimination~…the worker is fired because of discrimination by his supervisor.
179~V11~L3~Variable Value~Supervisor Discrimination~…although firms may hire with no intention of discrimination against protected employees, it is costly to prevent biases of supervisors from affecting employment outcomes for individual workers as supervisors can easily claim a dismissal is performace based, when in reality the supervisor is simply biased against certain types  of employees.
179~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Probability of First Period Discriminatory Termination~…the probability that a worker in the first period of life is discriminated against and fired.
179~V11~L4~Variable Value~For Cause~…a worker is fired if his productivity is revealed to be sufficiently low.
179~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Worker Ability~…assumed to be either high or low and that workers and firms are initially symmetrically uninformed about worker ability.
179~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Worker Ability~…a worker employed in either period of his life generates a signal, which is jointly observed by the worker and the firm and influences the perception of high or low ability.
179~DV4~L5~Variable Value~1st Period Low Ability~…conditional on a worker being of low ability, the signal is indicative of this with a certain probability.
179~DV4~L5~Variable Value~1st Period Low Ability~…the fraction of low-ability workers in each cohort is fixed and the marginal productivity of low productivity workers is set equal to zero.
179~DV4~L5~Variable Value~1st Period Low Ability~…wages are assumed to be sufficiently high so that any worker for whom signals low ability is fired immediately.
179~D2, D3~V3~Variable~Wages~…wages are assumed to be sufficiently high so that any worker for whom signals low ability is fired immediately.
179~V11~L3~Variable Value~Supervisor Discrimination~…to simplify the exposition, it is assumed that if the worker is discriminated against, then he is fired prior to the realization of the signal of ability.
179~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~1st Period Worker Ability~…the assumptions that workers are either high or low ability and that low-ability workers have zero productivity are not crucial here as comparable results can be obtained from a model in which employees' abilities are continuous and firms cannot adjust wages downward to match productivity.
179~D2, D3~V3~Variable~Wages~…wages are paid at the end of the period, so that a worker who is fired, for either reason, earns no wages in the period he is fired.
179~D1, D2~V12~Variable~Fired~…a binary variable indicating whether an individual was fired with specification for the period of termination.
179~D1, D2~V12~Variable~Fired~…individuals who are not fired continue to work throughout the first period of life, and are paid the period t inexperienced worker wage and participate in the labor market again in the second period, while workers who are fired in the first period do not work in the second.
179~V3~L6~Variable~Inexperienced Worker Wage~…the year fixed wage that all first period workers are assumed to be paid.
179~D2, D3~V13~Variable~Experience~…a binary variable indicating whether an individual is experienced or not experienced.
179~V13~L7~Variable Value~Experienced~…only individuals in the second period can be considered experienced.
179~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Probability of 2nd Period Discrimination~…the probability that an experienced worker that accepts a job is terminated due to discrimination.
179~DV4~L8~Variable Value~2nd Period Worker Ability~…if a worker is not discriminated against in the second period, a second signal of ability is generated and, as was the case in the first period, those who are revealed to be of low ability are fired, while any worker who is retained earns a time period based wage.
179~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Personal Litigation Cost~…a worker fired in either period draw a personal cost of suing from a density characterized by the cumulative distribution function.
179~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Maximum Damages~…a worker sues if the expected damage award conditional on filing a suit exceeds the personal litigation cost.
179~D1~V11~Variable~Reason for Termination~…it is assumed that each fired worker perfectly observes the reasons underlying his dismissal, but that courts observe these reasons imperfectly, hence workers fired for cause sometimes win employment-discrimination lawsuits, while workers who were actually discriminated against sometimes lose.
179~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Probability of Discriminatory Termination Win~…represents the probability that a worker who was actually discriminated against wins a discrimination lawsuit against their employer.
179~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Probability of For Cause Win ~…represents the probability that a worker who was fired for cause wins a discrimination lawsuit against their employer.
179~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Maximum Damages~…fired workers may sue for wages in the period they are fired and, after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, some punitive and compensatory damages.
179~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Propensity to Sue~…fired workers sue with based on the probability that they will earn the maximum amount of damages possible.
179~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Firm Revenue~…dependent on the number of high-ability experienced and inexperienced workers it employs.
179~D2, D3~V13~Variable~Experience~…because low-ability workers have a higher likelihood of being fired in their first period of employment experienced workers are more likely to have high ability than inexperienced workers.
179~D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Employment Decision~…it is assumed that firms consider all employment-related costs, including wages and the potential costs stemming from litigation in making employment decisions.
179~D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Employment Decision~…firms take current and future wages as exogeneous and choose employmentelvels to maximize the net present value of profits.
179~D2, D3~V3~Variable~Wages~…three factors may lead to differences in wages paid to experienced and inexperienced workers including differences in productivity, differences in the fraction of high-ability workers, and differences in the expected costs of litigation.
179~D2, D3~V13~Variable~Experience~…increased experience leads to greater productivity and hence higher wages, is the only signal of expected ability for a potential firm, and postively impacts expected litigation costs and wages.
179~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Expected Litigation Costs~…as an importan factor in leading to employment decisions.
179~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Expected Litigation Costs~…dependent on the experience of workers because as inexperienced workers are more likely to have low ability, they are more likley to be fired for cause which increases a firms expected litigation costs factoring into their employment decision.
179~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Expected Litigation Costs~…dependent on the likelihood that a worker is discriminated against as well as the personal costs of litigating.
179~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1987-1991~…time period of interest before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in which damages available to plaintiffs were limited to back pay.
179~D1, D2~T4~Time Period~1992-1996~…time period of interest after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in which the damages available to plaintiffs included both punitive and compensatory damages in addition to back pay.
179~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Maximum Damages~…the increase in potential damage awards as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 raises the cost of employing both inexperienced and experienced workers.
179~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Expected Litigation Costs~…to examinehow the returns to experience are affected as a result of the increase in potential damage awards due to the Civil Rights Act of 1991, expected litigation costs are differentiated with respect to the change in both punitive and compensatory damages available.
179~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Expected Litigation Costs~…the increase in punitive and compensatory damages affects firms' expected litigation costs through the fact that employees who sue successfully impose higher costs on the firm in the form of higher damage awards and through the prospect of higher damage awards inducing more displaced workers to file suit.
179~D2, D3~V2~Variable~Returns to Experience~…one key link between the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and returns to experience is how the propensity to sue conditional on employment varies with experience.
179~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Propensity to Sue~…a key determinant of the link between the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and returns to experience is how the inrease in propensity to sue conditional on employment varies with experience.
179~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Expected Litigation Costs~…firms respond in two ways to increases in potential costs of employment-discrimination litigation including adjusting its demand for protected workers leading to changes in wages, or investing in monitoring or training programs that reduce the likelihood protected workers are discriminated against.
179~D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Level of Monitoring~…a decreasing function of an individual firm's level of monitoring.
179~D2~V14~Variable~Labor Supply~…the ease of presentation of estimated results relies on the assumption that labor supply is completely inelastic, however altering the assumptions to claim that labor supply is somewhat elastic and that an increase in expected litigation costs associated with an increase in the non-back pay damages is larger for inexperienced workers makes it possible to construct examples in which the 2nd period wage increases in response to the non-back pay damages increase.
179~D1, D2, D3~V4~Variable~Age~…in order to examine the age distribution of employees making discrimination claims.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…used in conjuction with the Current Population Survey in order to measure the share of employed protected workers who file wrongfile termination complaints and compute how this share varies with age.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…used in conjuction with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in order to measure the share of employed protected workers who file wrongfile termination complaints and compute how this share varies with age.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…this data source lists a range of facts regarding each employee complaint, including the date the complaint was first filed, the basis of the complaint (e.g. race, gender, disability), and the issue (e.g. hiring, discharge, harrassment).
179~D1~V15~Variable~Complaint Basis~…the basis on which an employee has made an employer discrimination complaint including race, gender, or disability.
179~D1~V16~Variable~Issue~…the issue on which an employee has made an employer discrimination complaint including hiring, discharge, or harrassment.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…this data includes demographic information such as the plaintiff's state of residence, gender, race, and (for 70% of plaintiffs) age.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…researchers limit their sample to gender-based cases brought by women and race-based cases brought by black men that were first filed with the EEOC between 19988 and 1995.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…to eliminate age-based cases and concentrate on workers likely to be attached to the labor force, researchers look exclusively at plaintiffs aged 20 to 40 at the time of complaint.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…researchers limit their sample to include only termination-based litigation.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…in total there were 113,283 gender-based cases brought by white women aged 20 to 40 and 118,779 race-based cases brought by black men aged 20 to 40 and of these, a total of 149,489, or 64.4% were wrongful termination cases and comprise our final sample.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Annual Demographic File of the March Current Population Survey is used to estimate the number of employed white women and employed black men of each age between 20 and 40 in each year between 1988 and 1995.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in this dataset a worker is considered to be employed if they report working at least 1,000 hours during the past survey year.
179~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Percentage of Employees Who File an EEOC Complaint~…counts of workers are created by age/year/protected group, and then these counts and the number of complaints in each age/year/group cell are used to determine, by cell, the percentage of employees who file a complaint with the EEOC.
179~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Percentage of Employees Who File an EEOC Complaint~…this percentage indicates the approximate probability that a person of a given age who works at least 1,000 hours in a given year files a wrongful termination complaint.
179~D1~F2~Findings~Propensity to Sue by Gender, Race~…the percentage of employees who file an EEOC complaint is much higher for black men than for white women, whereas each year, the EEOC received a gender-based wrongful termination claim from approximately one out of every 2,500 to 3,500 employed white women, and a race-based wrongful termination claim from approximately one out of every 400 to 600 black men.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…this data is limited in that the age of the plaintiff is missing for approximately 30 percent of the obeservations and also that race-based complaints can be filed under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 directly in federal court as opposed to under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
179~D1~F3~Findings~Complaint Rate for White Women by Year and Age Group~…the complaint rate in 1990 and 1993 were 0.320 and 0.420, respectively, per 1000 for white women in their 20's, but only 0.222 and 0.328 per 1,000 for white women in their 30's, and over the full period from 1988 to 1991 and 1992 to 1995 the year complaint rate was 0.290 and 0.389, respectively, for 25-year-old white women and 0.192 and 0.331, respectively, for 35-year-old white women.
179~D1~F4~Findings~Complaint Rate for Black Men by Year and Age Group~…for black men in 1990 and 1993, the complaint rates were 2.02 and 2.18, respectively, per 1,000 for black men in their 20's but 2.38 and 2.56 for those in their 30's, while over the full period from 1988 to 1991 and 1992 to 1995 the EEOC received 1.74 and 1.79 complaints, respectively, per 1,000 25-year-old black men per year and 2.38 and 2.47 complaints, respectively, per 1,000 35-year-old black men per year.
179~D1~D1~Dataset~Equal Employment Opportunity Commission~…this data does not contain enough demographic information to allow researchers to validate or refute standing potential explanations for differing age trends in complaint rates.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in order to examine the effects of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 on labor-market outcomes for protected workers using data from the 1988 through 1996 Annual Demographic File of the March Current Population Survey.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…asks about current employment status including hours worked last week, full-time/part-time status, industry, and occupation, while also gathering detailed information about the respondent's employment in the previous calendar year, such as weeks and hours of work, and wages.
179~D2~V17~Variable~Employment Status~…whether or not an individual is employed full-time as one of the key measures of employment outcomes in this research paper.
179~D2~DV14~Variable~Hours Worked~…the number of hours works on an annual or weekly basis as one of the key measures of employment outcomes in this research paper.
179~D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…the hourly wage a survey respondent earned as one of the key measures of employment outcomes in this research paper.
179~D2~V17~Variable~Employment Status~…researchers define survey respondents who worked at least 35 hours on all jobs in the week before the Current Population Survey as currently employed.
179~D2~DV14~Variable~Hours Worked~…measured as the total hours worked in the calendar year before the interview as the product of the number of weeks the person reported working in the previous year and the reported hours per week.
179~D2~DV15~Variable~Hourly Wages~…calculated for the previous year by dividing the reported total wages for the year by the total hours worked.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…it is important to note that the years that researchers discuss regarding the Current Population Survey refer to the year about which the respondent was asked and not necessarily the survey year.
179~D2~V17~Variable~Employment Status~…employment status reported in March of a certain year refers to the individual's current employment status.
179~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Hours Worked~…reported retrospectively for a certain year in March of the next year.
179~D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…reported retrospectively for a certain year in March of the next year.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…all analysis is limited to Current Population Respondents between the ages of 25 and 39, a restriction that focuses on those with a strong labor-force attachment, minimizes the effects of schooling, and keeps the comparison group, white men, clean by removing ADEA protected workers.
179~D1, D2, D3~T3~Time Period~1987-1991~…all observations in this period are considered pre-Civil Rights Act of 1991.
179~D1, D2, D3~T4~Time Period~1992-1996~…all observations in this period are considered post-Civil Rights Act of 1991.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the maximum annual earnings in this Current Population Survey is $99,999 so the wage variable is right-censored, however this only affects 1.5% of all observations in the wage regressions.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…there are no noteworthy differences between the pre-Civil Rights Act of 1991 and post-Civil Rights Act of 1991 samples.
179~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Probit~…the primary methodology in this paper is to measure how the differences between protected and unprotected worker employment-outcome measures changed from the period shortly before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to the period shortly after, which is in fact measuring the difference-in-differences of employment outcomes before and after the law.
179~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Linear~…the primary methodology in this paper is to measure how the differences between protected and unprotected worker employment-outcome measures changed from the period shortly before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to the period shortly after, which is in fact measuring the difference-in-differences of employment outcomes before and after the law.
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the primary methodology in this paper is to measure how the differences between protected and unprotected worker employment-outcome measures changed from the period shortly before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to the period shortly after, which is in fact measuring the difference-in-differences of employment outcomes before and after the law.
179~D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…the 1991 measure of hourly wages include 40 days of post-CRA time and the data for these observations were recorded in March 1992, after the law was enacted.
179~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Hours Worked~…the 1991 measure of hourly wages include 40 days of post-CRA time and the data for these observations were recorded in March 1992, after the law was enacted.
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…a key assumption to the analysis in this research is that, in the absence of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, wages would not have changed in a way that differed by race or gender over the 1988 to 1995 period.
179~D1, D2, D3~T2~Time Period~1988-1996~…during the relevant time period, two minimum wage increases occurred in 1990 and 1991 possibly leading to ommited variable bias.
179~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Linear~…where the outcome is the amount of hours worked in a certain year for an individual respondent, and explanatory variables include an indicator for year, a vecor of control variables and a coefficient that explains how employment outcomes were affected by the law..
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…where the outcome is log hourly wages in a certain year for an individual respondent, and explanatory variables include an indicator for year, a vecor of control variables and a coefficient that explains how employment outcomes were affected by the law..

179~D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rates, Protected Status~…an interaction term between state unemployment and protected status indicators as included in the vector of control variables.
179~D2~DV17~Derived Variable~Marital Status, Gender~…an interaction term between marital status and female.
179~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Probit~…when researchers measure the effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 on employment status, the outcome is an indicator variable equal to one if the respondent reports full-time employment and the coefficients are estimated with a probit specification.
179~D2~V17~Variable~Employment Status~…an indicator varible equal to one if the respondent reports full-time employment.
179~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Linear~…if hours worked is the dependent variable, the vector of control variables includes indicators for year, state, high school and college graduation, five-year age categories, half percentage point intervals in state unemployment rates, marital status, and interactions between state unemployment and protected status indicators and between marital status and female.
179~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Probit~…if employment status is the dependent variable, the vector of control variables includes indicators for year, state, high school and college graduation, five-year age categories, half percentage point intervals in state unemployment rates, marital status, and interactions between state unemployment and protected status indicators and between marital status and female.
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…if log wage is the dependent variable, then the vector of control variables includes experience, experience squared and education, as well as indicators for year, state, state unemployment rate, and unemployment rate and protected sttaus indicator interaction terms.
179~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Labor Market Participation for White Women Relative to White Men~…the findings indicate that women participate in the labor market at significantly lower rates than men, work fewer hours than men, and earn 27% less hourly than men on a regression-adjusted basis.
179~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Employment, Hours, and Wages Pre- and Post-Civil Rights Act of 1991 for White Women~…log wages rose by 4% more for women than men over the pre-Civil Rights Act of 1991 period to the post-Civil Rights Act of 1991 period, while women's employment grew 2% more than men's, however these findings cannot be directly attributed to the act as when researchers control for female-specific trends in employment, hours, and wages, their exists only small and insignificant pre/post differences in the hours and wage regressions.
179~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Employment, Hours and Wages Pre- and Post-Civil Rights Act of 1991 for Black Men~…after trending up through 1991, black employment and hours worked dropped by around 2% relative to whites starting in 1992, suggesting that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 had a mild negative effect on the employment prospects of black men.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data from 1988 to 1996 March Current Population Survey, limited to black men and non-Hispanic white men and women aged 25 to 39.
179~D2, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…age minus years of education minus 6 as an ideal measure of workforce experience.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…does not contain enough historical employment information about individual respondents to allow a measure of actual experience.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…historical data is drawn from 1964 to 1995 in order to proxy for actual experience through labor-force participation rates, gender, race, education, and year of birth.
179~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Cell Average I~…in order to proxy for actual experience, researchers gather labor-force participation rates from the 1965 to 1995 March Current Pouplation Survey and divide respondents into cells along four dimensions including gender, race, education, and year of birth, and then sum average work expereince across years for each cell, and use this as a proxy for actual experience gathered by workers in this cell.
179~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Gender~…one of four dimensions in which respondents are divided into cells from historical Current Population Survey data in order to proxy for actual experience.
179~D1, D2, D3~V6~Variable~Race~…one of four dimensions in which respondents are divided into cells from historical Current Population Survey data in order to proxy for actual experience.

179~V20~L14~Variable Value~Some College~…an individual respondent has reported to have finished some college.
179~D2, D3~V23~Variable~Year of Birth~…one of four dimensions in which respondents are divided into cells from historical Current Population Survey data in order to proxy for actual experience.
179~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Cell Average I~…one problem with this measure is that the individuals observed to be working 1,500 or more hours in a year are likely to have different experience profiles than the average Current Population Survey respondent in a given cell, suggesting that if there is persistence in individual employment status, then average experience across all individuals in a cell is likely to be lower that the average actual experience of individuals in a cell who are currently employed.
179~D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cell Average II~…a secondary proxy for actual experience with solution to the issues of the Cell Average I that assumes that the individuals in any given gender-race-educatio-birth-year cell who work the most hours in a certain year are also those who worked the most hours in the year prior and the year two years prior.
179~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Cell Average I~…assumes that each individual's labor-force participation is completely independent from year to year.
179~D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cell Average II~…assumes that correlation of across-year participation is maximized.
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…estimated with the addition either potential or the cell-average proxy for actual experience as the outcome, respectively of an individual respondent in a particular year with the same set of control variables as in previous log hourly wages regressions.
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…when running the experience regressions, the main coefficient of interest represents the amount by which the returns to experience for the protected group exceeds that of the comparison group in a certain year where the first year's coefficient of interest is normalized to zero.
179~D1, D2, D3~DV21~Derived Variable~Gender, Race~…an interaction term used in order to discern between protection groups and comparison groups in estimations.
179~DV21~L15~Variable Value~White Women~…as the protected group for those white respondents.
179~DV21~L16~Variable Value~White Men~…as the comparison group for those white respondents.
179~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Wage Premium for White Women Relative to White Men by Age Group~…relative to white men, the wage premium for 30-year-old women relative to 25-year-old women was 1.5% higher after the Civil Rights Act of 1991 than before.
179~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Premium Differences by Experience for Women Pre- and Post-Civil Rights Act of 1991~…estimates indicate that the premium to being a woman whose cell averaged five years of experience more than another group increased by 4.2% and 5.8%, respectively, after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
179~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…data used in order to obtain a small sample of workers for whom researchers are able to measure actual workforce experience.

179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used from the 1986 to 1991 March Current Population Survey in order to perform a placebo analysis on returns to experience.
179~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…this data set has an advantage in that individuals can be followed  through their careers and, in turn, researchers can measure actual labor-market experience more accurately.
179~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…this data samples fewer than 12,000 individuals during the relevant time period.
179~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data surveys each resident of 60,000 different households during the relevant time period..
179~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…because this data is administered to the same people each year, it samples ages each year and, in turn, researchers are forced to drop the youngest pre-Civil Rights Act of 1991 observations and the oldest post-Civil Rights Act of 1991 observations in order to measure the returns to experience over comparable ranges of experience.
179~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Linear~…when using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, each regressions is estimated using 9,447 individual individual-year wage observations for white men and women between the ages of 27 and 31.
179~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Probit~…when using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, each regressions is estimated using 9,447 individual individual-year wage observations for white men and women between the ages of 27 and 31.
179~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Log-Linear~…when using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, each regressions is estimated using 9,447 individual individual-year wage observations for white men and women between the ages of 27 and 31.
179~D3~F10~Findings~Returns to Experience for Female Workers Pre- and Post Civil Rights Act of 1991~…the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-estimated pre/post change in female returns to experience is 0.0066 log points, a finding similar in magnitude to the estimates obtained using cell-average experience, however this coefficient is not signficantly different from zero.
179~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~Litigation Associated Costs Pre- and Post-Civil Rights Act of 1991 for White Women ~…all else equal, a 30-year-old woman's wage was 1.5 percent higher than a 25-year-old woman's after the Civil Rights Act of 1991 than it would have been before the act, suggesting that the increase in annual expected costs of litigation and litigation prevention associated with the Civil Rights Act of 1991 were $200 to $300 higher for a 25-year-old woman than for a 30-year-old woman.
179~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the median annual wage for 25-year-old white woman in the sample employed in full-time jobs in 1994 was $17,000.
179~D3~F12~Findings~Returns to Experience for Black Workers~…when using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, a coefficient for the coefficient on returns to experience for black workers was 0.026, although it is found that the relative change in returns to experience for black men was actually largest just prior to the passage of the Civil Rights ACt of 1991.
179~D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Returns to Education~…estimated separately for Current Population Survey respondents between the ages of 25 and 32 and for those between 33 and 39.
179~D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Returns to Education~…estimates how the relative-to-white-men returns to education for protected workers changed after the passage of the Civl Rights Act of 1991.
179~D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Returns to Education~…this specification allows researchers to control overall, age-group-specific, and protected-group-specific trends in returns to education, controls that are particularly important in this research as there is ample evidence to suggest there have been signficant chagnes in the returns to education overall and among certain demographic groups during the 1980's and 1990's.
179~D3~F13~Findings~Returns to Education for Young Black Men~…estimates suggest that for young black men, the returns to a year of education increased by 1.5% relative to older black men with a p-value of 0.16.
179~D3~F14~Findings~Returns to Education for Young White Women~…estimates suggest that for young white women, the returns to a year of education increased by 0.7% relative to older white women with a p-value of 0.19.
179~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Cell Average I~…in order to set up either cell average, the wage regression sample is partitioned into cells by birth year, gender, race and education using two categories for race, includingblack and non-Hispanic white, and four for education, including did not finish high school, high-school graduate, some college, and college graduate; then researchers gather information from the extended Current Population Survey sample period on how individuals in each cell accumulate work experience over time, examining all respondents who are in one of the cells and for whom age is greater than the minimum of 18 and that respondent's education plus six and for each respondent, work experience in that year is computed as the minimum of one and hours worked divided by 2,080.
179~D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cell Average II~…in order to set up either cell average, the wage regression sample is partitioned into cells by birth year, gender, race and education using two categories for race, includingblack and non-Hispanic white, and four for education, including did not finish high school, high-school graduate, some college, and college graduate; then researchers gather information from the extended Current Population Survey sample period on how individuals in each cell accumulate work experience over time, examining all respondents who are in one of the cells and for whom age is greater than the minimum of 18 and that respondent's education plus six and for each respondent, work experience in that year is computed as the minimum of one and hours worked divided by 2,080.
179~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Cell Average I~…to calculate this measure, first researchers compute the average of the work experience measure across individuals within a given cell in each Current Population Survey year, then these averages are summed across survey years to compute the cumulative average experience for members of each cell.
179~D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Cell Average I~…beginning in 1979, researchers compute average work experience across all such individuals who responded to the Current Population Survey, and for all members of this cell who appear in the data for the year 1990, researchers use the sum of average work experience of individuals in the cell from 1979 through 1989 as the Cell Average I measure of work experience.
179~D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cell Average II~…to calculate this measure, researchers begin with the wage regression sample and for each year and cell, researchers compute the share of all Current Population Survey respondents who worked at least 1,500 hours and thus qualified for our wage regression sample; then to compute the actual experience proxy for that year and cell, researchers look to the historical Current Population Survey data.
179~D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cell Average II~…the procedure of calculating this measure is best illustrated by an example: suppose that of the white female high-school graduates born in 1960 who responded to the March 1991 Current Population Survey, 60% worked 1,500 or more hours in 1990; beginning in 1979, researchers then compute the average experience in that year of the 60% of white female high-school graduates born in 1960 who worked the most hours, then repeat this calculation for the years 1980 through 1989 and sum these average experience figures across years to obtain the Cell Average II measure of work experience for white female high school graduates whom are observed to be employed in 1990.
180~180: The Long and Short of Household Formation~~~~
180~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~"…the goal of this research is to provide a unified treatment of the determinants of household formation. To understand these determinants, it is useful to examine the ""headship rate"", defined as the ratio of the number of household heads to the size of the adult population."
180~D3~V1~Variable~Household~…the author follows the Census Bureau in defining a household as all individuals occupying a given housing unit, regardless of family structure.
180~D3~V2~Variable~Housing Unit~"…the Census Bureau defines a housing unit as "" a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters."""
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the aggregate headhsip rate, which is the reciprocal of the average number of people per household, determines the number of units needed to house a population of a given size.
180~D1, D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Household Formation~…by taking logarithms and differencing the headship rate equation, one can see that the (approximate) percentage change in the number of households is simply the sum of the (approximate) percentage changes in the adult population and the headship rate.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…this paper focuses on the determinants of the headship rate rather than immigration, fertility, or other factors affecting population growth.The author studies these determinants in several steps. Since headship rates rise steadily over most of the life cycle, the effect of the agging population, which has been pushing up the headship rate - or, equivalently, pushing down the average household size - since at least the 1970s, is isolated and stripped out. The residual component of the headship rate has actually drifted down over time, although it has fluctuated substantially at shorter frequencies.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…this research uses multinomial logit models and decomposition techniques for the bulk of the analysis.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…although the average household size is probably a more intuitive concept, the theory and empirical work in this paper is much easier to cast in terms of the headship rate.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…applying estimation insights, the author estimates a fairly simple econometric model of the headship rate and then projects it forward using the Congressional Budget Office's forecast of the unemployment rate through the end of the decade.
180~D6~V3~Variable~Forecasted Unemployment Rates~…the Congressional Budget Office's forecast of the unemployment rate through the end of the decade.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~"…although the aggregate headship rate - the ratio of households to people - is a simple concept, examining individual choices that affect the headship rate requires careful accounting. In particular, it is not always obvious whom to label as the ""head"" of a household, either theoretically or empirically."
180~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…a set of characteristics assigned to household heads including those such as age, sex, and educational attainment.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage Offer~…provided an individual is neither out of the labor force nor unemployed, one earns a wage offer contingent on individual characteristics.
180~D1, D2, D3~V4~Variable~Living States~…an individual makes a choice among a set of four discrete living states.
180~V4~L1~Variable Value~Living with Family Members~…one of four discrete living states.
180~V4~L2~Variable Value~Living Alone~…one of four discrete living states.
180~V4~L3~Variable Value~Living with a Spouse or Domestic Partner~…one of four discrete living states.
180~V4~L4~Variable Value~Living with Non-Relative Roomates~…one of four discrete living states.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Utility Benefits~…each living state involves a different set of utility benefits contingent on individual characteristics.
180~D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Housing Costs~…each living state involves different housing costs.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Transfer Payment~…the chosen living state may involve a transfer payment contingent on individual characteristics from other members of the household to compensate her for home production that benefits them, particularly if she does not work outside the home.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~…consider an adult in period t with a set of characteristics, such as age, sex, and educational attainment. Provided she is neither out of the labor force nor unemployed, she earns her wage offer. She makes a choice among a set of four discrete living state. Each state involves different utility benefits and housing costs. The chosen state may also involve a transfer payment from other members of the household to compensate her for home production that benefits them, particularly if she does not work outside the home. Her decision problem each year is a maximum likelihood function involving all of these factors while also including an increasing and concave function and the cost of switching states.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Decision Problem~…this formulation of the choice problem emphasizes the trade-off between the utility and housing cost implications of a particular state, condition on realized labor income.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage Offer~…the wage offer may vary with demographics.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Utility Benefits~…the utility benefits may vary with demographics.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the wage offer and utility of a state may vary with demographics, which is why changes in the demographic profile of the population can affect the headship rate, even holding choices constant for a given set of individual characteristics.
180~D3~V2~Variable~Housing Unit~…the model ignores the actual choice of where to live. Once a state is chosen, all housing units are identical, and individuals are indifferent between owning and renting.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the model ignores the actual choice of where to live. Once a state is chosen, all housing units are identical, and individuals are indifferent between owning and renting.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the choice of whether to enter the labor market is exogenous, and there is no search and matching process for finding a partner. In this model, an individual can immediately - though not necessarily costlessly - find a spouse or partner whose preferences regarding labor outside the home complement her own.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the model includes a cost of switching household states, which implies that the choice of a state today will be affected by the choice made yesterday. Rational individuals will thus take expected future conditions into account today.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…since the data used in this paper are cross-sectional, the model does not allow for dynamics.
180~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Labor Market Status~…the choice of whether to enter the labor market is exogneous.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~V6~Variable~Matching Process~…there is no search and matching process for finding a partner. In the model, an individual can immediately - though not necessarily costlessly - find a spouse or partner whose preferences regarding labor outside the home complement her own. For example if she prefers to work and have a partner who concentrates on home production, she can always find one who is willing to do so in exchange for a transfer payment.
180~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Cost of Switching Household States~…for completeness the model includes a cost of switching household states, which implies that the choice of a state today will be affected by the choice made yesterday. Rational individuals will thus take expected future conditions into account today.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…mapping the decision problem into a headship rate requires specifying how each living state contributes to headship.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mapping Function~…a function that maps states, condtional on characteristics, onto contributions. Since the point is to relate people to a household, which by definition occupies one housing unit, the function is subject to the constriant that the contribution of all individuals in a household must sum to 1.
180~DV9~L5~Variable Value~C(spouse/partner)~…if each member of a married couple counts as half a head , then C(spouse/partner) = 1/2, regardless of characteristics.
180~DV9~L6~Variable Value~C(spouse/partner;male)~…if heterosexual married men always count as the household head, as was the case in Census data prior to 1980, then C(spouse.partner;male) = 1.
180~DV9~L7~Variable Value~C(spouse/partner;female)~…if heterosexual married men always count as the household head, as was the case in Census data prior to 1980, then C(spouse.partner;female) = 0.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mapping Function~…the particular choice of C (ht; θt) may depend on the data available or the empirical methodology chosen. The key point is that once a mapping is defined, researchers can calculate the headship rates for different segments of the population.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…once a mapping function is defined, researchers can calculate headship rates for different segments of the population.
180~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this research draws on cross-sectional microdata from the Current Population Survey.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…this research draws on cross-sectional microdata from the American Community Survey.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…this research draws on cross-sectional microdata from the decennial censuses.
180~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the author uses the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the CPS, frequently referred to as the March CPS, to construct annual headship rates from 1980 through 2012.
180~D1~T1~Time Period~1980-2012~…survey period from which CPS data is drawn to construct annual headship rates from 1980 through 2012.
180~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…while the sample consists of less than 100,000 people substantially fewer than the American Community Survey or the decennial censuses, the CPS does ask the relevant questions about within-household relationships that the author needs to construct various headship measures. This data also has the advantage of being available annually over a relatively long time span.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…the second source of data is the ACS, an annual 1% sample of the United States population - approximately 3 million people - that includes detailed information on a variety of characteristics, including demographics, income, and employment status.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…unlike the CPS, the ACS has a large enough sample to draw reliable inferences about patterns at the metropolitan level.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…although versions of the ACS IPUMS are available from 2000 onwards, the survey was not fully implemented until 2006. Consequently, the author uses the 2006 and 2010 waves of the ACS to estimate headship models that shed light on the aftermath of the housing bust.
180~D2~T2~Time Period~2006-2010~…the researcher draws data from the 2006 and 2010 waves of the ACS.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~...to compare large samples over a longer time horizon, the researcher uses the 5% microdata samples from the 1980 and 2000 censuses.
180~D3~T3~Time Period~1980-2000~…survey years from which data from the 5% microdata samples of the censuses are drawn.
180~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS excludes people in institutions, such as prisons or nursing homes.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the Census includes people in institutions, such as prisons or nursing homes.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…the American Community Survey includes people in institutuions, such as prisons or nursing homes.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the CPS headship rate is markedly higher than both the Census and the ACS. Importantly, however, the trends in all of the series are broadly similar. For example, both census and CPS data show an increase in the headship rate from 1990 to 2000, followed by a decline back to roughly the 1990 level by 2010. The ACS, meanwhile, shows a relatively similar decline to the CPS in the latter half of the 2000s. Consequently, the author draws on each data set for a different part of his analysis of headship rates.
180~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source is used to decompose annual movements in the headship rate from 1980 to the present.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the microdata from the 1980 and 2000 censuses is used to compare longer run differences in behavior that affects headship and household formation.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…the 2006 and 2010 waves of the ACS microdata are used to examine the most recent decline in headship and household formation.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…the 2005 ACS, while a full 1% sample, did not contain information on the population in group quarters, such as prisons or college dormitories. While the researcher drops the group quarters population from his data anyway, since by definition they do not live in households, the 2005 sample is not comparable to later samples because of differences in the available population weights. In the 2005 data, individuals in households with similar demographic characteristics as those in group quarters receive larger weights in order to match the overall population estimates. The difference in weights throws off even non-group quarters comparisons with later years in ways that may not be obvious to researchers.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the Census Bureau has not released microdata from the 2010 Census. Even if these data become available, they will be of limited use, since the replacement of the old long-form questionnaires with the ACS has sharply reduced the amount of useful information in the Census itself.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the gaps between these measures across datasets implicitly reflect differences in vacancy rates. For given population and housing stock counts, a higher headship rate implies more households and fewer vacant units.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…importantly, the ACS lacks any information on credit-worthiness, other than income.
180~D4~D4~Dataset~FRBNY/Equifax~…in order to examine the effect of credit-related constraints on headship decisions, this research uses information from the FRBNY/Equifax consumer credit panel, which is a 5% random sample of credit-related information from all individuals with credit records and Social Security numbers. This research focuses in particular on individuals' credit scores and the presence of a foreclosure on their credit report.
180~D4~D4~Dataset~FRBNY/Equifax~…while the Equifax sample lacks any demographic information other than age, it does contain detailed geographic identifiers that make it possible to indirectly impute credit scores to individuals in the ACS
180~D4~V9~Variable~Credit Scores~…while the Equifax sample lacks any demographic information other than age, it does contain detailed geographic identifiers that make it possible to indirectly impute credit scores to individuals in the ACS. The imputation is a two-step process. First, the researcher links individuals in the 2006 and 2010 waves of the credit panel to aggregate block and block-group level data from the 2000 Census. Within each year and public use microdata area (PUMA), the researcher regresses credit scores, foreclosure, and default on a nonlinear function of age and, given the demographics in the 2000 Census, the probabilities that an individual is of a given race, is of Hispanic origin, or has a given level of education attainment. The credit score and probability of a prior foreclosure is imputed to each individual in the IPUMS using the resulting PUMA-level coefficients.
180~D2, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Probability of a Prior Foreclosure~...within each year and public use microdata area (PUMA), the researcher regresses credit scores, foreclosure, and default on a nonlinear function of age and, given the demographics in the 2000 Census, the probabilities that an individual is of a given race, is of Hispanic origin, or has a given level of education attainment. The credit score and probability of a prior foreclosure is imputed to each individual in the IPUMS using the resulting PUMA-level coefficients.
180~D2, D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Imputed Credit Scores~…variation in imputed credit information comes from geography - the PUMA of the individual - crossed with his or her demographic characteristics and education.
180~D2~M3~Methodology~Two-State Least Squares~…imputing credit scores for ACS respondents involves a two step respondent that first links individuals in the 2006 and 2010 waves of the credit panel to aggregate black and block-group level data from the 2000 Census and then, within each year and public use microdata area (PUMA), regresses credit scores, foreclosure, and default on a nonlinear function of age and, given the demographics in the 2000 Census, the probabilities that an individual is of a given race, is of Hispanic origin, or has a given level of educational attainment. The researcher then imputes a credit score and probability of a prior foreclosure to each individual in the IPUMS using the resulting PUMA-level coefficients.
180~D2~D2~Dataset~American Community Survey~…although the microdata from the 2011 ACS are available, the author prefers the 2006 to 2010 comparison because a recovery in housing activity and prices appears to have begun in late 2011, and the desired focus is on the low point of they cycle. In any case, the 2006 to 2011 results are quite similar.
180~D4~D4~Dataset~FRBNY/Equifax~…all personally identifiable information in the panel is stripped by Equifax.
180~D4~D4~Dataset~FRBNY/Equifax~…the data contain Equifax Risk Scores, which are broadly similar to FICO scores.
180~D2, D3~V7~Variable~PUMA~…a PUMA is the smallest geographic area that is identifiable in the IPUMS.
180~D2, D4~V9~Variable~Credit Scores~…credit scores are included in imputational regressions to assign credit scores and the probability of a prior foreclosure to each individual in the IPUMS.
180~D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Foreclosure~…foreclosure are included in imputational regressions to assign credit scores and the probability of a prior foreclosure to each individual in the IPUMS.
180~D2, D4~V11~Variable~Default~…defaults are included in imputational regressions to assign credit scores and the probability of a prior foreclosure to each individual in the IPUMS.
180~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Age~…regressions involving credit scores, foreclosures, and defaults are ran on a nonlinear function of age.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Race Probability~…regressions involving credit scores, foreclosures, and defaults are ran on the probability that an individual is of a given race, given the demographics in the 2000 Census.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~Hispanic Origin Probability~…regressions involving credit scores, foreclosures, and defaults are ran on the probability that an individual is of Hispanic origin, given the demographics in the 2000 Census.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Educational Attainment Probability~…regressions involving credit scores, foreclosures, and defaults are ran on the probability that an individual has a given level of educational attainment, given the demographics in the 2000 Census.
180~D2, D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Imputed Credit Scores~…imputing credit in this way loses any idiosyncratic individual-level variation. This could be problematic if the effect of credit differs across the predictable and idiosyncratic components. Given the lack of large representative data sets with employment, income, and credit information, however, it is an improvement over existing work.
180~D2, D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Imputed Credit Scores~…the imputation process meets the criteria for the credit variables to serve as generated regressors, which means that - unlike when variables are measured with error-simple estimators remain consistent, although standard errors must be adjusted to account for the multi-stage estimation process.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the aggregate headship rate in year t can be decomposed into a weighted sum of headship rates by age, where the weights are the fraction of the population at each age.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Age Weight~…the fraction of the population at each age.
180~D1, D2, D3~V12~Variable~Age~…the aggregate headship rate in year t can be decomposed into a weighted sum of headship rates by age, where the weights are the fraction of the population at each age.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~F1~Findings~Estimated Life Cycle Headship Rate Trends~…over the life cycle, headship rates rise rapidly from less than 20% at age 18 to about 50% at age 30, then increase more gradually. The substantial range of these estimates points to an important role for the age composition of the population: All else equal, an older population will demand more housing units, since older people tend to live in smaller households.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~L8~Variable Value~Age Constant Headship Rate~…one can examine the effect of aging on the aggregate headship rate by defining a new aggregate that holds the headship rate for each age constant at its average value over time, while allowing the age profile of the population to vary.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…since the two components of the headship rate depend on age-specific headship rates, calculating them requires the researcher to specify the mapping function, the contribution of each living state to headship, conditional on characteristics.
180~DV9~L9~Variable Value~C(family)~…for the purposes of this paper, the author assumes that C(family) = 0.
180~DV9~L10~Variable Value~C(alone)~…for the purposes of this paper, the author assumes that C(alone) = 1.
180~DV9~L5~Variable Value~C(spouse/partner)~…for the purposes of this paper, the author assumes that C(spouse/partner) = 1/2.
180~DV9~L11~Variable Value~C(roomate)~…for the purposes of this paper, the author assumes that C(roomate) = 1 divided by the number of unrelated adults living together.
180~DV9~L9~Variable Value~C(family)~…adults living in the house of a family member other than a spouse contribute nothing to headship.
180~DV9~L10~Variable Value~C(alone)~…adults living alone are full heads, by default.
180~DV9~L5~Variable Value~C(spouse/partner)~…spouses each count as half a head.
180~DV9~L11~Variable Value~C(roomate)~…roomates each contribute equally to headship.
180~DV9~L8~Variable Value~Age Constant Headship Rate~…shows what the aggregate headship rate would have been in each year if the headship rate at each age had remained constant at its average level over time while only the age distribution of the population had changed.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mapping Function~…this research drops all individuals younger than 18 from the calculations. The author considers the person responding to the survey to be the default head; family members other than his or her spouse contribute nothing. For example, if a married couple is living with the parents of one spouse, and one of the parents is the first person on the survey form, then each parent counts as half a head, and the younger couple contributes nothing.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…Census population projections are used to extrapolate the aging effect into the future.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…to examine changes in individual behavior that affected the overall headship rate, the researcher uses decennial census microdata from 1980 and 2000.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV15~Derived Variable~Fraction of Unemployed or Out of the Labor Force~…the mean value of which is broken out by year to examine changes in individual behavior that affected the overall headship rate.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Average Real Income~…the mean value of which is broken out by year to examine changes in individual behavior that affected the overall headship rate.
180~D2, D3~DV17~Derived Variable~Average Rent~…the mean value of which is broken out by year to examine changes in individual behavior that affected the overall headship rate.
180~D2, D3~DV17~Derived Variable~Average Rent~…this measure is calculated for each metropolitan statistical area and imputed to each household.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV13~Derived Variable~Educational Attainment Probability~…the mean value of which is broken out by year to examine changes in individual behavior that affected the overall headship rate.
180~D3~F2~Findings~Census Estimated Demographic Proportions~…using decennial census microdata from 1980 and 2000, estimates show that the fraction with a college education rose from 16% to 25%, while the fraction Hispanic nearly doubled and the average age increased by two years.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…to get a sense of how demographic characteristics affect choices among the four living states - with family, alone, with a spouse or partner, with a roomate - the researcher estimates a multinomial logit model, pooling the observations from 1980 and 2000.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…this model can be thought of as a reduced-form implementation of the theoretical model, with the most important limitation being the lack of any dynamics, since the cross-sectional nature of the data do not allow for them.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the decennial census microdata do not distinguish actual college graduates from individuals with four or more years of college.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV15~Derived Variable~Fraction of Unemployed or Out of the Labor Force~…note that mean unemployment as defined here differs significantly from the published unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for two reasons: first, this figure uses the entire adult population as the denominator, rather than just the number of individuals in the labor force. Second, differences in how questions about employment status asked in the CPS and Census lead to different responses.
180~D1, D2, D3~V5~Variable~Labor Market Status~…differences in how questions about employment status are asked in the CPS and Census lead to different responses.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…this model includes log income, log MSA rent, and a series of indicator variables for unempoyment, labor force participation, high school or college attendance, educational attainment, race, Hispani origin, and sex. In addition, since some individuals report having very low, zero, or even negative incomes despite being neither unemployed nor out of the labor force, the author defines an additional indicator variable for incomes of less than $1,000. In order to flexibly control for the effects of the shifting age distribution over this period, B-splines for age are included and, because behavior among women at different ages shifted differentially relative to men, they are interacted with the female dummy. Finally, to control as best as possible for unobserved metropolitan characteristics, a full set of metropolitant fixed effects are included.
180~D2, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Log Income~…the multinomial logit model includes log income.
180~D2, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Log MSA Rent~…the multinomial logit model includes log MSA rent.
180~V5~L12~Variable Value~Unemployed~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for unemployment.
180~D1, D2, D3~V13~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for labor force participation.
180~D1, D2, D3~V14~Variable~High School Attendance~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for current high school attendance.
180~D1, D2, D3~V15~Variable~College Attendance~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for current college attendance.
180~D1, D2, D3~V16~Variable~Educational Attainment~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for educational attainment.
180~D1, D2, D3~V17~Variable~Race~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for race.
180~D1, D2, D3~V18~Variable~Hispanic Origin~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for Hispanic origin.
180~D1, D2, D3~V19~Variable~Sex~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for sex.
180~D1, D2, D3~V20~Variable~Income Less Than $1,000~…since some individuals report having very low zero, or even negative incomes despite being neither unemployed nor out of the labor force, the researcher defines an additional indicator variable for incomes of less than $1,000.
180~D1, D2, D3~V20~Variable~Income Less Than $1,000~…the multinomial logit model includes an indicator variable for incomes less than $1,000.
180~D3~DV20~Derived Variable~B-Splines for Age~…in order to flexibly control for the effects of the shifting age distribution over the 1980 to 2000 period in multinomial logit regressions, B-splines for age are included.
180~D3~DV21~Derived Variable~B-Splines for Age, Female~…because behavior among women at different ages shifted differentially relative to men, interactions between the B-splines for age and the female dummy are included in multinomial logit regressions.
180~D2, D3~V21~Variable~Metropolitan Fixed Effects~…to control as best as possible for unobserved metropolitan characteristics, a full set of metropolitan fixed effects are included.
180~D3~F3~Findings~Census Unemployment and Living State Probabilities~…all else equal, being unemployed raises the probability of living with family by about 4.5 percentage points, raises the probability of living alone by about 2 percentage points, and raises the probability of living with roomates by more than 3 percentage points. Since the probabilities in each row must sum to zero, being unemployed also necessarily reduces the probability of living with a spouse or partner by 10 percentage points.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the marginal effects of the multinomial logit model are calculated at the covariate means. Each column represents one of the four possible living states, and each row one of the covariates. In each row, the probabilities must sum to zero.
180~D2, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Log MSA Rent~…the rent data are simply MSA-level averages taken from the 1980 and 2000 censuses.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the rent data are simply MSA-level averages taken from the 1980 and 2000 censuses.
180~D2, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Log Income~…the log income variable is set equal to zero for individuals who are unemployed, out of the labor force, or have low incomes by this definition. The coefficient on log income thus captures only changes to income on the intensive margin.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the 1980 Census did not distinguish unmarried partners from roomates.
180~DV9~L5~Variable Value~C(spouse/partner)~…because the 1980 Census did not distinguish unmarried partners from roomates, the spouse or partner variable only includes spouses in that year.
180~DV9~L11~Variable Value~C(roomate)~…because the 1980 Census did not distinguish unmarried partners from roomates, the roomate variable includes unmarried partners.
180~D3~F4~Findings~Census Average MSA Rent and Living State Probabilities~…a 20% increase in the average rent of an individual's MSA of residence, which corresponds to about one standard deviation of the log rent distribution, implies an increase in the probability of living with family of about 2 percentage points and a decrease in the probability of living with a spouse or partner of about 3.5 percentage points.
180~D3~F5~Findings~Young Adults, Unemployment and Living State Probabilities~…among adults between the ages of 18 and 30, being unemployed increases the probability of living with family by a full 9%, more than twice as high as in the population as a whole.
180~D3~F6~Findings~Young Adults, Average MSA Rent and Living State Probabilities~…among adults between the ages of 18 and 30, a 20% increase in rent raises the probability of living with a family by about 3.5% and lowers the probability of being married or living with a partner by a slightly smaller amount. 
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~"…one can examine the magnitude of the potential effects by using a nonlinear analogue to the standard Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition. The decomposition divides the change in an average outcome over time into two components where a bar indicates an average over individuals. This decoposition includes the probability from a multinomial logit model for a specific outcome given covariates and coefficients. Also, a vector of the change in the average covariates and a vector of the marginal effects are included. In the second line, the difference between the two terms including the response probability is the portion of the difference in probabilities that can be explained by the model, while the unexplained portion that arises from estimating coefficients on the pooled sample is denoted by U. The third line comes from taking a first-order Taylor approximation of both response probability terms around the average covariate across both years, with N denoting the approximation error. One can then further decompose the linearized ""explained"" part of the probability difference into portions attributable to each covariate, simply by expanding the inner product in the third line."
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV22~Derived Variable~Response Probability~…the response probability from a multinomial logit model for a particular outcome given specific covariates and coefficients.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV23~Derived Variable~Average Covariate Changes~…a vector of the change in the average covariates as included in decomposing the results of multinomial logit regressions.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV24~Derived Variable~Marginal Effects~…a vector of the marginal effects as included in decomposing the results of multinomial logit regressions.
180~D2, D3~DV19~Derived Variable~Log MSA Rent~…this research uses tenant's rent as the measure of housing costs throughout this paper, under the assumption that it also captures movements in the implicit rent of owner-occupied housing. While this assumption may not be entirely palatable, calculating implicit rent requires making strong and potentially misleading assumptions about unobservable factors like the risk premium or expected capital gain.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV25~Derived Variable~Explained Difference in Probabilities~…the difference betweent he two terms containing  is the portion of the difference in probabilities that can be explained by the model.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV26~Derived Variable~Unexplained Difference in Probabilities~…the unexplained portion of difference in probabilites that arises from estimating coefficients on the pooled sample over the relevant period.
180~D3~F7~Findings~Aggregate Headship Rate Trend Over the Long Run~…during the period from 1980 to 2000, decomposition results show that the the aggregate headship rate rose from roughly 49.5% to 50.5%.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV26~Derived Variable~Unexplained Difference in Probabilities~…the author is primarily interested in the effects of changes in the economic and individual characteristics, so to keep things simple he pools the data to estimate coefficients and labels the residual as the unexplained coefficient.
180~D3~F8~Findings~Living State Contribution to Headship~…under the assumptions about contributions to headship, living with a spouse or partner or with a roomate contributes about 0.5 to headship. Consequently, a total reduction in these categories of about 2 percentage points and a corresponding increase in living alone implies the total increase in headship of about 1 percentage points observed in the data.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV25~Derived Variable~Explained Difference in Probabilities~…indicates the amount of difference implied by the estimated effects from the multinomial logit model and the changes in the covariate averages from 1980 to 2000.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV26~Derived Variable~Unexplained Difference in Probabilities~…expresses the residual. This residual comprises changes in relevant covariates not included in the model as well as changes in the coefficients on those covariates between 1980 and 2000, since the researcher pools the observations when he estimates the logit model.
180~DV9~L11~Variable Value~C(roomate)~…most people living with roommates in the data live with just one.
180~D3~F9~Findings~Real Rent and Headship Rates~…the increase in real rent of more than $1,500 per year suppressed headship by lowering marriage and partnership rates, while simultaneously raising the fraction living with family members. These results suggest that the housing stock in desirable areas was not sufficiently elastic to accomodate all of the new households that would have resulted if real rents had remained flat. Instead, rent (and house prices) had to rise to equilibrate the housing market.
180~D3, D4, D5, D6~F10~Findings~Model Accountancy for Living State Changes~…the model accounts for only about a fifth of the change in the fraction living with a spouse or partner, even though the decline of 1.13 percentage points understates the true change, because the 1980 data only count spouses and not partners. This result suggests that other changes in behavior, such as changes in preferences or other relevant covariates not included in the model, must have played an important role in holding down the behavioral component of the headship rate during this period.
180~D1, D2, D3~T2~Time Period~2006-2010~…a period in which the aggregate headship rate fell by more than half a percentage point, driven by a decline in the behavioral component.
180~D1, D2, D3~T4~Time Period~2008-2010~…a period after the housing market had begun to collapse but roughly concurrent with the largest increases in unemployment.
180~D2~F11~Findings~ACS Estimated Economic Proportions~…the fraction of the population that was unemployed in the ACS increased by about 75% between 2006 and 2010, while the average real income fell. Meanwhile, the fraction of indiviuals with a foreclosure on their credit score as imputed by the procedure more than doubled. The average credit score increased slightly over this period, despite the foreclosures and other adverse credit events in the wake of the financial crisis. Finally, although house prices fell substantially during this period, the average MSA-level real rent increased, likely because rental units offered an alternative to former owner-occupants.
180~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…to focus on how individual and economic attributes affect headship choices throughout the ACS data sample, the researcher estimates a multinomial logit model that parallels that specified for the census data.
180~D2~F12~Findings~ACS Unemployment and Living State Probabilities~…in the ACS data, being unemployed implies a 7% point higher probability of living with adult family members and an even larger decline in the probability of living with a spouse or partner. Similarly, individuals with a lower incomes are more likely to live with family or with roomates and less likely to live with a spouse or partner.
180~D2~F13~Findings~ACS Average MSA Rent and Living State Probabilities~…short runs parallel long-run results in that higher rent in the individual's metropolitan area has a large effect on headship, with 20% higher rents - about one standard deviation - implying that individuals are about 3 percentage points more likely to live at home. They are about 2 percentage points each less likely to live alone or with a spouse, and about 1 percentage point more likely to live with roomates.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~F14~Findings~Credit Scores and Living State Probabilities~…a one standard deviation increase in credit score raises the probabilty of living with a spouse by about 2 percentage point and reduces the probability of living alone by the same amount. In addition, a foreclosure raises the probability of living with family by 9 percentage points, thanks to reductions in living alone and with roomates.
180~D2, D4~F15~Findings~Foreclosures and Living State Probabilities~…taken at face value, short-run estimates indicate that a foreclosure increases the probability that a young adult lives with a spouse or partner by about 65 percentage points and decreases the probability he lives with family by more than 50 percentage points.
180~D1, D2, D3~DV27~Derived Variable~Percentage in Each Living State~…shows the percentages of individuals who were in each living state in 2006 and 2010.
180~D2~F16~Findings~Headship Rate Decline and Living State Contributions~…differences indicate that the decline in headship of about 0.8 percentage points during the period from 2006 and 2010 can be largely attributed to an increase in the fraction of individuals living with family.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel ~…this research uses the insights from the microdata to construct a relatively simple econometric model of the headship rate and uses the model to project headship given the baseline labor market projection from the Congressional Budget Office.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…this research uses the insights from the microdata to construct a relatively simple econometric model of the headship rate and uses the model to project headship given the baseline labor market projection from the Congressional Budget Office.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel~…in order to construct a model used to project headship given the baseline labor market projection from the Congressional Budget Office, the researcher estimates a panel regression of headship rates, pooling across ages and years, on a linear time trend and the lagged unemployment gap.
180~D1, D2, D3~V22~Variable~Linear Time Trend~…the linear time trend, as included in panel regressions of headship rates, captures the sort of long-run behavioral changes seen in long run multinomial logit results.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Unemployment Gap~…the unemployment gap, as included in panel regressions of headship rates, proxies for a variety of cyclical labor market conditions.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel~…this model allows the coefficients on the unemployment gap and the trend to vary by age with the groups defined as 30 or younger and 31 or higher.
180~V12~L13~Variable Value~30 or Younger~…the younger of two aggregated age groups of interest in the current research.
180~V12~L14~Variable Value~31 or Higher~…the older of two aggregated age groups of interest in the current research.
180~V12~L13~Variable Value~30 or Younger~"…those individuals 18 to 30 are referred to as ""young adults"" throughout this research."
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…note that modeling the headship rate at each age implicitly strips out the effects of the aging population on the aggregate headship rate, so the coefficients only capture the behavioral effects.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel~…note that modeling the headship rate at each age implicitly strips out the effects of the aging population on the aggregate headship rate, so the coefficients only capture the behavioral effects.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Unemployment Gap~"…the unemployment gap equals the unemployment rate less an estimate of the ""natural rate"" or equilibrium unemployment rate. The author takes both the projections of the unemployment rate and the past and future estimates of the natual rate from the Congressional Budget Office's latest Budget and Economic Outlook."
180~D6~D6~Dataset~Congressional Budget Office~…the author takes both the projections of the unemployment rate and the past and future estimates of the natural rate from the Congressional Budget Office's latest Budget and Economic Outlook.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel~…these results are robust to reasonable alternative specifications of the age groups, such as including a third group for post-retirement age adults.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel~…this model also includes a full set of age dummies in order to finely control for differences in the level of the headship rate over the life cycle.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~M2~Methodology~Panel~…for reasons of clarity, the model does not fully separte the equation for each age. The projection results are much the same if the model does so.
180~D2, D6~F17~Findings~Age, Unemployment Gap and the Headship Rate~…young adults are quite sensitive to the business cycle, with each percentage point rise in the (aggregate) unemployment gap depressing the headship rate by 0.36 percentage points, relative to trend. By contrast, the headship rate of adults more than 30 years old drops by only 0.08 percentage points. The downward trend in headship has also been much stronger among younger adults.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…panel regression estimates, combined with the Census Bureau's population projections from 2012, allow the prediction of the headship rate through 2020. To do so, the fitted values of the headship at each age are calculated, given the time trend and the predicted unemployment gap from the CBO. Then, compuations aggregate the age-specific fitted headship rates using the Census Bureaus projected population shares as weights, which reintroduces the effects of the aging population.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the headship projection depends crucially on the unemployment gap.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Unemployment Gap~…the unemployment gap rose to about 4 percentage points in 2010 before declining over the last two years. Despite this decline, the CBO projects that the gap will remain elevated through 2014 before falling back to roughly zero in 2017.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…this measure is calculated in the aggregate, predicted given the unemployment gap projection, and, finally, predicted when the unemployment gap is set to zero over the whole horizon.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~F18~Findings~Unemployment Gap and Headship Rates~…if the unemployment gap had been zero in 2011, the model predicts that the headship rate would have been more than half a percentage point higher, which translates to an additional 1.5 million households.
180~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~...between the 2000 and 2010 Censuses, the adult U.S. population grew by about 25 million, or 2.5 million per year. The Census Bureau projects that average population growth from 2012 through 2020 will be somewhat slower, about 2.2 million per year.
180~D1, D5~F19~Findings~Headship Rates and Household Formation~…even if the headship rate were to remain falt at its 2012 level of about 51.5%, one would thus expect new household formation of 1.1 to 1.2 million per year, substantially higher than in recent years. If the headship rate follows the model projection, household formation will be faster, averaging 1.5 to 1.6 million per year from 2013 until 2017, at which point it will slow as the headship rate reaches a level consistent with roughly full employment.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…there are several caveats associated with predicted headship rate estimates. First, the model presented here is relatively simple. Second, the differences in headship rate estimates from the CPS, Census, and ACS should reduce confidence in the model predictions, since it exclusively relies on the CPS. Finally, the translation between household formation and new residential construction is also fraught with difficult, which is why the author does not interpret household formation of 1.5 to 1.6 million as implying any particular level of construction, at least in the short and medium runs.
180~D1, D2, D3, D6~DV28~Derived Variable~Unemployment Gap~…the predicted headship rates are simple in that they use the unemployment gap as a summary of economic conditions, ignoring relevant factors with which the gap may not be well correlated, including housing costs and credit conditions.
180~D1, D2, D3~V22~Variable~Linear Time Trend~…the predicted headship rates are simple in that they rely on a time trend to predict long-term behavioral shifts.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…the difference in headship rate estimates from the CPS, Census, and ACS should reduce confidence in the model predictions, since it exclusively relies on the CPS.
180~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Headship Rate~…since the levels of the headship rate differ so widely across surveys, the researcher has deliberately avoided trying to estimate the total number of households or the size of the vacant stock.
180~D1, D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Household Formation~…given the predicted headship rate, the predicted pace of household formation depends on aggregate population growth.

180~D1, D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Household Formation~"…estimates of household formation differ across surveys. The ""revised"", time-consistent estimates from the Housing Vacancy Survey suggest that approximately 550,000 new households formed per year between 2006 and 2011. Estimates derived directly from the CPS are higher, particularly from 2006 to 2007 and from 2010 on."

181~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
181~D1~T1~Time Period~1980-1987~…from 1980 to around 1987, wage inequality increased in a rapid and monotonic fashion: wages at the top grew most rapidly, those in the middle less rapidly, and those at the bottom the least of all.
181~D1~T2~Time Period~1988-2006~…since the late 1980s, wages at the upper end of the distribution have continued to grow rapidly relative to the middle, but the lower end has not lost out relative to the middle.
181~D1~T2~Time Period~1988-2006~…time period during which growth in the supply of skills slowed considerably after 1980, and the wage structure, in consequence, widened.

181~D3~D3~Dataset~Piecework~…since no national sample covers all parts of the wage structure before 1939, researchers have pieced together data from various sources to track the wage structure changes from 1890 to 1940.
181~D3~T7~Time Period~1890-1940~…time period from which data from various sources to track wage structure is pieced together to track wage structure changes before 1939.

181~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Transitory Earnings Variation~…refers to short-run (for example, year-to-year) volatitility in earnings, and permanent earnings variation refers to variation across individual in long-run (for example, decadal) average earnings.
181~D1~F4~Findings~Wage Inequality and Permanent Components of Earnings Variation~…although transitory earnings variation increased in the 1980s, the bulk of the rise of cross-sectional wage inequality was driven by relatively permanent components of earnings variation, including rising returns to education.
181~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…three important aspects of wage inequality are reported in the March FTFY weekly sample covering 1963 to 2005 and for the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group hourly wage sample covering 1973 to 2006 including the 90-10 overall log wage differential (for males), the 90-10 residual log wage differential (for males), and the college-high school log wage differential (for males and females combined)
181~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~90-10 Overall Log Wage Differential~…one aspect of wage inequality reported from the March CPS FTFY weekly sample and for the CPS MORG hourly wage sample for males only.
181~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~90-10 Residual Log Wage Differential~…one aspect of wage inequality reported from the March CPS FTFY weekly sample and for the CPS MORG hourly wage sample for males only.
181~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~College-High School Log Wage Differential~…one aspect of wage inequality reported from the March CPS FTFY weekly sample and for the CPS MORG hourly wage sample for females and males only.
181~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~90-10 Overall Log Wage Differential~…difference between log wages at the 90th and those at the 10th percentile.
181~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~90-10 Residual Log Wage Differential~…differences between log wages at the 90th percentile and those at the 10th percentile unexplained by age and education.
181~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~90-10 Residual Log Wage Differential~…theses are residuals from regressions, estimated separately each year, of log wages on a full set of age and schooling dummy variables and interactions of the schooling dummies with a quartic in age.
181~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~…log wage regressions run on a full set of age and schooling dummy variables and interactions of the schooling dummies with a quartic in age.
181~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~College-High School Log Wage Differential~…fixed-weighted average of the log wage differential betweeen those with at least a bachelor's degree (sixteen or more years of schooling) and those with exactly a high school degree (twelve years of schooling), estimated separately each year by sex for four different experience groups.
181~D1~V5~Variable~Education~…reported as years of schooling and then aggregated into distinct education levels.
181~V5~L1~Variable Value~Bachelor's Degree~…those with at least a bachlor's degree must report having sixteen or more years of schooling.
181~V5~L2~Variable Value~High School Degree~…those with exactly a high school degree must report exactly twelve years of schooling.
181~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~90-10 Overall Log Wage Differential~…displays large increases throughout the first part of the 1980s.
181~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~90-10 Residual Log Wage Differential~…displays large increases throughout the first part of the 1980s, but in contrast to the March Current Population Survey FTFY series, residual inequality stopped growing after the mid-1980s for hourly wages in the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group.
181~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~College-High School Log Wage Differential~…displays large increases throughout the first part of the 1980s.
181~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Divergence~…rapid growth of overall wage inequality in the 1980s followed by deceleration in the 1990s is a divergence in inequality trends between the top and the bottom half of the wage distribution.
181~D1~F5~Findings~Divergence and 90-10 Log Wage Differential~…substantial increases in wage inequality occurred in both the upper half (90-50) and the lower half (50-10) of the distribution from 1979 to 1987, expanding the 90-10 log wage differential by 18 log points; the trends in upper-half and lower-half wage inequality diverged after 1987, with the former continuing to rise steadily and the later ceasing to rise (and actually contracting by 4 log points from 1987 to 2005). This divergence of upper-half and lower-half inequality since the mid-1980s is also apparent for more-comprehensive measures of compensation that include the value of employee benefits, and does not simply reflect the disproportionate recent increases in the burden of (and wage off-sets from) rising health insurance benefit costs for middle-wage workers.
181~D1~V6~Variable~Compensation~…a comprehensive measure of compensation that includes the value of employee benefits.
181~D1~F6~Findings~Log Hourly Real Wage Growth from 1974 to 2005~…when plotting cumulative log hourly real wage growth by wage percentile (from the 4th to the 96th percentile) for 1974 to 1988 and for 1988 to 2005, an almost linear speading out of the wage distribution is apparent from 1975 to 1988, driven by changes in the first half of the 1980s. In contrast, wage growth has polarized since 1988.
181~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Log Hourly Real Wage Growth~…plotted by percentile in order to determine show more precisely where in the distribution the divergence of upper- and lower-half wage inequality occurred.
181~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers use the 1980 and 2005 Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group samples to estimate a modified human capital earnings regression of log hourly wages.
181~D1, D4~M1~Methodology~Mincerian Log Wages~…researchers use the 1980 and 2005 Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group samples to estimate a modified human captial earnings regression of log hourly wages on the following variabes: a linear spline in years of schooling, with breakpoints after twelve and sixteen years; a quartic in experience; dummy variables for race, region, and sex; and interactions of sex and the experience quartic.
181~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Linear Spline~…the linear spline in education allows the returns to education to differ for kindergarten through 12th grade, college, and postcollege (graduate and professional) schooling.
181~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…researchers adjust individual wages in the 1980 sample by imposing the 2005 returns to schooling, and compare the distributions of actual and adjusted wages in 1980 to determine what wage inequality would have been in 1980 had returns to education been at 2005 levels.
181~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…1980 wages are adjusted for each individual to incorporate 2005 returns to education as follows: first, for each of three education categories, the product of the individual's years of schooling in that category is calculated and the difference in estimated returns to a year of shcooling in that category between 2005 and 1980 are calculated; researchers then add the sum of these three results to each individual's 1980 wage.
181~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Linear Spline~…a linear spline in years of schooling, with breakpoints after twelve and sixteen years as included in a modified Mincerian human capital earnings regression of log hourly wages.

181~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…wages in 2005 are analogosly adjusted by imposing the 1980 education returns.
181~D1~F7~Findings~Earnings Regression Estimates~…estimates of the earnings regressions for 1980 and 2005 imply that the returns to schooling both increased and convexified. Returns to a year of kindergarten through 12th grade schooling rose by 0.9 log point, from 0.063 to 0.072, between 1980 and 2005, but returns to a year of college rose by 5.3 log points, from 0.076 to 0.129, and returns to a year of postcollege schooling rose by 6.9 log points, from 0.073 to 0.142. 
181~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Divergence~…the growing convexification of returns to education has played a key role in the divergence of upper- and lower-half inequality since the late 1980s.
181~D1~F8~Findings~Returns to Education and Variance of Log Hourly Wages~…the simulations show that the increase in returns to schooling (which comes almost entirely from the rise in retunrs to postsecondary schooling) served to increase the variance of log hourly wages by 0.053 from 1980 to 2005; thus, increased returns to schooling account for 65% of the actual overall variance increase of 0.081 (from 0.248 in 1980 to 0.329 in 2005) for men and women combined. Increased returns to schooling can also account for an increase in the 90-10 log hourly wage differential of 0.133, or about 55% of the overall increase of 0.241.
181~D1~F9~Findings~Returns to Education and Growth in Hourly Wages by Gender~…in separate analyses by sex, it is found that rising returns to schooling explains 62% of the growth in hourly wage variance for men and 37% for women.
181~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…researchers use the Integrated Public Use Micro-samples from the 1940 to 1970 decennial to extend the March Current Population Survey series on overall male FTFY weekly wage inequality back to 1939.
181~D2~T8~Time Period~1940-1970~…the growth in wage inequality since the late 1970s was preced by a substantial narrowing of the wage structure during the Great Compressions of the 1940s, when the male 90-10 log weekly wage gap decreased by 35 log points, and then by a period of little change in wage inequality during the 1950s and 1960s.
181~D4~D4~Dataset~Social Security Administration~…a continuous series for 1937 to 2004 on annual earnings inequality for male commerce and industry workers from Social Security Administration earnings histroy data.

181~D4~T9~Time Period~1937-2004~…survey period from which a continuous series of annual earnings inequality data is drawn from Social Security Administration earnings history data.
181~D4~D4~Dataset~Social Security Administration~…this time-series pattern is similar to the Census/Current Population Survey weekly wage inequality series and reveals that the great narrowing of wages in the 1940s continued until 1953, although it was sharpest during World War II.
181~D4~D4~Dataset~Social Security Administration~…individual-level longitudinal annual earnings data starting in 1973 have recently become available, but these data do not include information on educational attainment or on weeks and hours worked.
181~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…researchers use the Census IPUMS data to examine educational wage differentials back to 1940, and then link the results to data obtained from the 1915 Iowa state census to create a consistent measure of returns to education back to that year.

181~D1, D2, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~White to Blue Collar Wage Differentials~…white-collar to blue-collar wage differentials reinforce the findings of shrinking educational wage differentials from 1915 to 1940.
181~D1, D2, D4~F10~Findings~Inequality and Wage Differentials by Occupation and Education~…researchers conclude that wage inequality and wage differentials by occupation and education shrank substantially during the first half of the twentieth century.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Returns to Education~…estimates imply that the majority of the increase in wage inequality since 1980 can be accounted for by increased returns to education dominated by large increases in returns to college and postcollege schooling.
181~D1, D4~M2~Methodology~Mincerian Log Wages~…researchers model changes in educational wage differentials using the conceptual framework of a race between the supply of skills (driven by changes in the educational attainment of the workforce) and the demand for skills (driven by skill-biased technological change).
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…this approach is applied to understand the observed trends in the college wage premium from 1915 to 2005.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…the illustrative framework to this approach starts with a constant-elasticity of substitution.

181~D1, D2, D4~DV19~Derived Variable~Unskilled Labor-Augmenting Technological Change~…skill-neutral technological improvements raise skilled labor-augmenting technological change and unskilled labor-augmenting technological change.
181~D1, D2, D4~DV22~Derived Variable~Ratio of Skilled to Unskilled Labor-Agumenting Technological Change~…the ratio of skilled labor-augmenting technological change to unskilled labor-augmenting technological change.
181~D1, D2, D4~DV22~Derived Variable~Ratio of Skilled to Unskilled Labor-Agumenting Technological Change~…increases in this ratio represent skill-biased technological changes.
181~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Technology Parameter~…increases in this parameter represent skill-biased technological change.

181~D1, D2, D3~DV24~Derived Variable~High School Equivalents~…those with twelve or fewer years of schooling plus half of those with some college.
181~D1, D2, D4~DV25~Derived Variable~Skill Group Marginal Product~…under the assumption that college and high school equivalents are paid their marginal products, researchers can solve for the ratio of the marginal products of the two skill groups, yielding a relationship between relative wages and relative skill supplies in a specific time period.
181~D1, D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Demand Shifts~…measured in log quantity units, depends on the skill-biased technological change parameters and indexes relative demand shifts favoring college equivalents
181~D1, D2, D4~DV21~Derived Variable~Aggregate Elasticity of Substitution~…the aggregate elasticity of substitution between college and high school equivalents is the key parameter determining how much a change in skill supply affects the college wage premium.
181~D1, D2, D4~DV21~Derived Variable~Aggregate Elasticity of Substitution~…the greater this measure, the smaller is the impact of a shift in relative supply on wages, and the greater must be fluctuation in demand shifts for any given time series relative to wages to be consistent with a given time series of relative quantities.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV26~Derived Variable~Demand Shifts~…the greater this measure, the smaller is the impact of a shift in relative supply on wages, and the greater must be fluctuation in demand shifts for any given time series relative to wages to be consistent with a given time series of relative quantities.

181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…where the outcome is the log of the wage differential between skilled and unskilled and the outcome is dependent on demand shifts, measured in log quantity units, and depends on the skill-biased technological change parameters and indexes relative demand shifts favoring college equivalents.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…bracketed terms in this equation show how changes in the college wage premium over time depend on a race between the relative demand for and the relative supply of skills.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…researchers directly measure the college wage premium and the relative supply of college equivalents.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…assuming a plausible value for the aggregate elasticity of substitution, researchers then use this regression to generate an implied time series of relative demand shifts.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…this preferred model is estimated on national data for 1914 to 2005, with demand shifts given by smooth time trends and an allowance for institutional wage setting in the 1940s.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~College-High School Log Wage Differential~…the ratio of skilled wages to unskilled wages, i.e. college equivalent wages to high school equivalent wages.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~F11~Findings~Relative Skill Supply and College Wage Premium~…the preferred model estimated on national data for 1914 to 2005, with demand shifts given by smooth time trends and an allowance for institutional wage setting in the 1940s, indicates that a 10% increase in relative skill supply reduces the college wage premium by 6.1%, implying that the aggregate elasticity of substitution is equal to 1.64. A near identical estimate is obtained for a variety of specifications of time trends estimated on data for 1963 to 2005 in Autor, Katz, and Kearny and Goldin and Katz.
181~D1, D2, D4~F12~Findings~Log College Wage Premium from 1950 to 2005~…the large increase in the log college wage premium, from 0.313 in 1950 to 0.618 in 2005 took place while the relative supply of college workers was sharply increasing.
181~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~FTE Employment by Education Level~…the college graduate share of full-time equivalent employed increased from 7.8% in 1950 to 31.8% in 2005, and the college equivalent share increased from 12.4% to 46.2% in the same time period. These tabulations use the 1950 Census IPUMS and the 2005 CPS MORG for the workforce aged eighteen to sixty-five years.
181~D4~F14~Findings~Supply and Demand in the Long Run~…supply and demand forces kept pace over the long run from 1915 to 2005, each growing at about 2.9% a year on average.
181~D1, D2, D3~F15~Findings~Relative Supply of College Equivalent Workers~…consider that the college wage premium did not rise from 1960 to 1980 but increased by 0.90% a year from 1980 to 2005, whereas relative demand growth was slightly slower from 1980 to 2005 (3.76% a year) than it had been from 1960 to 1980 (3.85% a year). In contrast, the growth in relative supply of college workers decreased from 3.89% a year from 1960 to 1980 to 2.27% a year from 1980 to 2005. Thus the deceleration in relative supply growth more than fully explains the post-1980 rise in the college wage premium.
181~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Skill Supplies~…researchers measure skill supplies in efficiency units, taking into account systematic differences in productivity (wages) by age, sex, and education within each skill aggregate and adjusting for changes in the age-sex-education group composition of hours worked within each skill aggregate.

181~D1, D2~V12~Variable~Immigrant Status~…a binary variable specifying for whether a respondent is an immigrant or native born.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV26~Derived Variable~Demand Shifts~…the implied negative relative demand growth in the 1940s is most likely picking up strong institutional interventions in wage setting during World War II and a surge in unionization; similarly, some of the rapid implied demand growth in the 1950s may reflect a partial unraveling of these institutional forces.
181~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Skill Supplies~…national skill supplies can change because of shifts in the educational distribution of the native-born workforce and because of immigration.
181~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Foreign-Born Share of the Workforce~…the foreign-born share of the workforce declined from around 21% in 1915 to 5.4% in 1970 before rebounding to 15.1% in 2005; these estimates are from tabulations using the 1910, 1920, and 1970 Census IPUMS and the 2005 CPS MORG.
181~D1, D2, D3~DV28~Derived Variable~Relative Skill Supply~…the relative supply of skilled (college equivalent) to unskilled (high school equivalent) workers can be decomposed into native-born and immigrant components through a log log regressions.
181~D1, D2~V10~Variable~Immigrant Skill Supply~…the supply of immigrant workers in a specific skill group as a factor in decomposing the relative supply of skilled to unskilled workers to native-born and immigrant components.
181~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Native Born Skill Supply~…the supply of native born workers in a specific skill group as a factor in decomposing the relative supply of skilled to unskilled workers to native-born and immigrant components.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…this model is used in order to estimate the relative supply of skilled to unskilled workers decomposed into native-born and immigrant components. The outcome in this specification is log of the relative supply of skilled laborers and explanatory variables include the native born contribution to the log skill supply ratio and the immigrant contribution to the log skill supply ratio.
181~V10~L3~Variable Value~Supply of Skilled Labor~…equal to the supply skilled immigrants plus the supply of skilled natives.
181~V10~L4~Variable Value~Supply of Unskilled Labor~…equal to the supply of unskilled immigrants plus the supply of unskilled natives.
181~D1, D2~DV30~Derived Variable~Native-born Contribution~…the native-born contribution to the log skill supply ratio as an explanatory variable included in a log log regression estimating the relative supply of skilled to unskilled workers decomposed into native-born and immigrant components.
181~D1, D2~DV31~Derived Variable~Immigrant Contribution~…the immigrant contribution to the log skill supply ratio as an explanatory variable included in a log log regression estimating the relative supply of skilled to unskilled workers decomposed into native-born and immigrant components.
181~D1, D2, D3~F17~Findings~Annual Rate of Growth for the Relative Supply of College Equivalents~…the annual rate of growth in the relative supply of college equivalents declined by 1.62 percentage points, from 3.89% a year for 1960 to 1980 to 2.27% a year for 1980 to 2005. Of this decrease 1.40 percentage pints (86% of the total) was due to the slowdown in the relative supply of the college educated among the native born. Only 0.22 percentage points (14%) was due to immigration.
181~DV28~L7~Variable Value~Native Born Relative Supply~…changes in the growth of the relative skill supply of the native-born can arise either from changes in the growth of educational attainment of successive birth cohorts or from changes in the size of entering cohorts due to baby booms and baby busts.
181~D1, D2, D3~DV28~Derived Variable~Relative Skill Supply~…the main source of rising national skill supply from 1915 to 1980 was the rapidly increasing educational attainment of successive cohorts of the native-born; similarly, the main factor in the slowing of skill supply growth since 1980 has been slower growth in the educational attainment of post-1950 cohorts of the native born.
181~D1, D2~DV33~Derived Variable~Single-Year-of-Age Birth Cohorts~…used in order to compare mean years of schooling (measured at age thirty) for birth cohorts of native-born Americans from 1876 to 1980.
181~D1, D2, D3~F18~Findings~Educational Attainment~…average educational attainment increased by 4.67 years (or 0.93 years per decade), from 8.49 years for those born in 1900 to 13.16 years for those born in 1950. In contrast, those born in 1975 have only 0.74 years of schooling more (0.30 year per decade) than their parents' generation born in 1950.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…this model is used to decompose the growth of relative skill supply of the native-born into educational attainment growth across cohorts and changes in cohort size; this methodology is analogous to te previous specification in which demoposed overall relative skill supply growth into immigrant and native-born components, and uses data on skill supply single-year-of-age birth cohorts.
181~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log Log~…results are adjusted to thirty years of age using results of a regression of the log of mean years of schooling by birth cohort-year cell on a full set of birth cohort dummies and a quartic in age, using Census IPUMS data for 1940 to 2000; the samples include all native born residents aged 25 to 64.
181~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~…data used in order to derive mean years of schooling by birth cohort-year cell on a full set of birht cohort dummies and a quartic in age, using IPUMS data fir 1940 to 2000; samples include all native-born residents aged 25 to 64.
181~D1, D2, D3~F19~Findings~Total Decline in the Annual Growth Rate of College Equivalents~…of the total decline in the annual growth rate of domestic supply of college educated workers of 1.4 percentage points (3.83% minus 2.43%) from 1960-1980 to 1980-2005, almost 70% (0.97 percentage point) was due to the slowdown in the growth of educational attainment across successive birth cohorts.
181~D1, D2, D3~F20~Findings~Deceleration of Educational Attainment~…the deceleration in the educational attainment of the native-born explains a 0.59% a year rise in the college wage premium, compared with an actual increase of 0.90% a year, from 1980 to 2005.
181~D4~D4~Dataset~OECD~…the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Reports the United States high school graduation rate in 2004 at 75%, compared with 83% among EU nations. The United States high school graduation rate was in the bottom third of twenty-six OECD nations in 2004. The United States ranked only seventh out of the twenty richest OECD nations in 2004. The United States ranked only seventh out of the twenty richest OECD nations in secondary school completion among 25- to 34-year-olds in 2004, even when the General Educational Development diploma recipients are included as secondary school completers. This data also indicates taht the United States is at about the OECD average for four-year college completion rates among young cohort, trailing twelve other nations.
181~D1, D2, D3~F21~Findings~Employment Shares and Employment Growth~…during the 1980s employment shares declined substantially at the bottom of the skill distribution, and employment growth increased continuously as one moves up the distribution; in contrast, employment growth polarized in the 1990s: the most rapid employment growth was in the highest-skilled jobs, declines in employment shares occured for middle-skilled jobs, and employment shares in the lowest skilled occupations were flat or even rising.
181~D1, D2~V13~Variable~Job Type~…determined by skill distribution.
181~V13~L5~Variable Value~College Jobs~…those in the top half of the skill distribution.
181~V13~L6~Variable Value~Noncollege Jobs~…those in the bottom half of th skill distribution.
181~D1, D2, D4~F22~Findings~Mean Gap in Employment Share Growth Rates~…the mean gap in employment share growth rates between college jobs and noncollege jobs shrank from the 1980s to the 1990s in a manner consistent with the slowdown in relative demand growth for college equivalents from the 1980s to the 1990s.
181~D4~D4~Dataset~OECD~…reports that the United States ranked eleventh for males and tenth for females out of thirty countries in its summary measure of education attainment (mean years of schooling) for 25- to 34-year-olds in 2004.
181~D4~T11~Time Period~2006.0~…source year in which OECD data  is reported in.
183~183: Market size in Innovation: Theory and Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry~~~~
183~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…this paper constructs a simple model linking innovation rates to current and future market size, and documents the empirical relationship between market size and innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…in this paper, researchers investigate the effect of market size on drug entry and phamaceutical innovation.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…an endogenous variable as better products will have larger markets, an issue that becomes a major difficult in investigating the impact of market size on innovation;however this problem is overcome by exploiting variations in market size driven by United States demographic changes.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…to estimate potential market size, researchers construct age profiles of users for each drug category, and then compute the implied market size from aggregate demographic and income changes given these time invariant age profiles.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Profiles~…time-invariant age profiles estimated for each drug category used to estimate potential market size.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…innovation in the pharmaceutical market is measured using the Food and Drug Administration's approval of new drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…results are reported using changes in OECD market size as well as United States market size.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…corresponds to the number of users times their marginal willingness to pay, therefore, market size can increase both because the number of users increases and because their marginal willingness to pay changes.
183~D2, D3~V1~Variable~Number of Users~…the number of users of a drug in order to derive the market size for that drug.
183~D2, D3~V2~Variable~Marginal Willingness to Pay~…the marginal willingness of a customer or a drug used in order to derive the market size for that drug.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F1~Findings~Potential Market Size and Total Drug Entry~…estimates suggest that a 1% increase in the size of the potential market for a drug category leads to a 6% increase in the total number of new drugs entering the United States market.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F2~Findings~Potential Market Size and New Nongeneric Drug Entry~…a 1% increase in potential market size leads to approximately a significant 4% increase in the entry of new nongeneric drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F3~Findings~Potential Market Size and New Molecular Entities Entry~…a 1% increase in potential market size is associated with a 4% to 6% increase in the entry of new molecular entities, however it is also possible that the marginal innovations induced by an increase in market size are less productive, so this magnitdue increase in the number of new drugs may correspond to a smaller increase when weighted by effectiveness or other measures of productivity.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…what the market size would be if the number and incomes of individuals in a particular age group change without a change in the age profile of use and expenditure.
183~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~Potential Market Size and Actual Market Size~…a 1% increase in potential market size is associated with approximately a 4% increase in actual market size.
183~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Individual Demand~…each individual demands only one type of drug.
183~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Endowment~…each individual has an exogenously given endowment at a specific time.
183~D1~V4~Variable~Discount Rate~…the discount rate of the consumers and the interest rate faced by the economy used in order to determine preferences.
183~D1~V5~Variable~Consumption~…consumption of an individual of the basic good at a specific time used in order to determine preferences.
183~D2, D3~V6~Variable~Consumption of Drug~…the consumption of one type of drug for an individual used in order to determine preferences.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Preferences~…dependent on the discount rate of the consumers and the interest rate faced by the economy, the consumption of an individual of the basic good at a specific time, and the consumption of one type of drug.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Preferences~…the Cobb-Douglas functional form and the assumptions that each individual only consumes one type of drugs are for simplicity and do not affect the main result.
183~D1~V7~Variable~Consumption~…researchers normalize the price of the basic good to 1 in all periods.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Total Demand~…summing across individuals, total demand for a specific drug is a function of total income and prices.
183~D2, D3~V8~Variable~Price of Drug~…the price of the relevant drug of interest.
183~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Total Income~…the total income of the group of individuals consuming the relevant drug of interest.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Preferences~…the Cobb-Douglas assumption implies that the share of income spent on drugs is constant, an assumption that can easily be relaxed by considering a utility function with an elasticity of substitution different from one, as in the factor market models with directed technical changes.
183~D1, D2, D3~V9~Variable~Quality~…at any one point in time, there is one firm with the best-practice technology for producing each type of drug, and it can produce one unit of this drug with a certain level of quality using one unit of the basic good.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…if there is an innovation for a certain drug line currently with a certain quality, this leads to the discovery of a new drug with improved quality.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…for the purposes of the model used in this paper, researchers think that any innovation is approved and can be sold to consumers immediately (and is under patent protection indefinitely).
183~D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~R&D Expenditure~…there is free entry into research and development, and each firm has access to a research and development technology that generates a flow rate of innovation for every dollar spent for research on a specific drug.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…reported as a flow rate of innovation and of entry of new drugs.
183~D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~R&D Expenditure~…a key feature of research and development technology for the focus of this paper is that research is directed in the sense that firms can devote their research and development to developing particular types of drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV7~Derived Variable~Total Demand~…the demand curves have an elasticity equal to one, so an unconstrained monopolist would charge an arbitrarily high price; however the firm with the best drug in a specific line is competing with the next drug in that line.
183~D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Limit Price~…because an arbitrarily high price would allow the next best firm to capture the entire market, the firm with the best drug sets a limit price to exclude the next firm, i.e. to ensure that consumers prefer its product rather than the next best drug supplied at the lowest possible price, i.e. the marginal cost, which is 1.
183~D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Profits~…the profits of the firm with the best product of quality in a specific drug line corresponds to the market size for the drug.
183~D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Profits~…profits of drug companies are independent from quality which is a feature of the Cobb-Douglas utility.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…equivalent to the estimated total sales for a certain drug.
183~D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Future Profits~…firms are forward-looking and discount future profits at the discount rate.
183~D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Future Profits~…the discounted value of profits for firms can be expressed by a standard dynamic programming recursion.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Firm Value~…the value of a firm that owns the most advanced drug of quality in a certain drug line at a specific time is dependent on the flow of profits, research and development expenditures at a specific time on this line by other firms.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Firm Value~…the value of owning the best technology in a certain drug line is equal to the flow profits plus the potential appreciation of the value and takes into account that at the innovation flow rate there will be an innovation causing the current firm to lose its leading position and to make zero profits thereafter.
183~D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Profits~…free entry into research and development to develop better quality drugs implies zero profits.
183~D2, D3~DV10~Derived Variable~Future Profits~…through this paper, it is assumed that the revelant transversality conditions hold and discounted values are finite in calculating future profits.
183~D2, D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Profits~…the greater is the market size for a particular drug, the more profitable it is to be the supplier of that drug.
183~D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~R&D Expenditure~…higher productivity of research and development increases research and development expenditures, and a higher interest rate reduces research and development since current research and development expenditures are rewarded by future revenues.
183~D2, D3~V11~Variable~Productivity of R&D~…the productivity of research and development efforts as having a positive correlation on research and development expenditures.
183~D1~V4~Variable~Discount Rate~…as having a negative relationship with research and development expenditures since current research and development expenditures are rewarded by future revenues.
183~D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~R&D Expenditure~…at any point in time, research and development for a particular drug line is determined by the current market size, i.e. past and anticipated future market sizes do not affect current research effort, an implication of the linear research and development technology, which ensures that whenever there are profit opporutnities, there will immediately be sufficient research and development expenditures to arbitrage them, ensuring that their firm value equals zero.
183~D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~R&D Expenditure~…investing in research and development far in advance of the increase in market size is not profitable, since another firm would improve over this innovation by the time the larger market materializes.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…the equation measuring entry of new drugs relates innovation or entry of new products to market size.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Market Size~…equal to the total expenditure of consumers in a certain line of drug.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…the equation measuring entry of new drugs encompasses the alternative view of the determinants of innovation, that the cross-drug distribution of R&D is determined by technological research opportunities or perhaps by other motives unrelated to profits.
183~D2, D3~DV12~Derived Variable~R&D Expenditure~…the equation measuring this variable allows for within-period decreasing returns.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…if there is an anticipated increase in the market size for a drug, there will be entry of new drugs in advance of the actual increase.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…researchers measure entry or innovation of new drugs as new drugs approvals by the FDA in broad drug categories, a measure that includes entry of generic drugs.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…a series of distinct drug categories in order to specify for which drug line innovation and entry occurs in.
183~V12~L1~Variable Value~Generic Drugs~…although generic drugs do not correspond to innovation, their entry is driven by the same profit incentives as innovation.
183~V12~L2~Variable Value~Nongenerics~…include all drugs that are not identical or bioequivalent to an exisiting drug.
183~V12~L3~Variable~Molecular Entities~…new molecular entities  are drugs classified by the FDA as containing an active ingredient previously not marketed in the United States.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…through the analysis portion of this paper, researchers use potential market size, instead of actual market size, driven by demographic changes.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Conditional Mean of New Drugs~…a Poisson model for the conditional mean of new drugs including potential determinants, time effects, and rearranging.
183~D4~V13~Variable~Expectations Operator~…included in computing the conditional mean of new drugs.
183~D2, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Innovation & Entry~…the number of new drugs in a specific category in a specific time period included in computing the conditional mean of new drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…included in computing the conditional mean of new drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Conditional Mean of New Drugs~…specifying for time components in this equation ensures that time effects have proportional impacts on entry of new drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Poisson Model~…for the conditional mean of new drugs dependent on an expectations operator, the number of new drugs in a category at a specific time period, the log of potential market size, a vector of controls, and a vector of time effects.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Poisson Model~…note that this equation allows the coefficient of the log of market size to differ from 1, which could be the case if actual market size differs systematically from the potential market size, or if preferences are not Cobb-Douglas.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Poisson Model~…the estimation of this equation would lead to biased estimates, however, since the nonlinearity makes it impossible to estimate the fixed effects consistently.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Quasi-Maximum Likelihood~…used in order to correct for biased estimates of the Poisson model due to nonlinearity and the impossibility of estimating fixed effects consistently.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Quasi-Maximum Likelihood~…dependent on the number of drugs approved in category over the entire sample, removing the drug category dummies, and making it so that the coefficient of interest can be estimated consistently.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Quasi-Maximum Likelihood~…this equation is estimated using quasi-maximum likelihood, which has been shown to have good consistency properties, even when the true model is not Poisson, for example, when there is a different distribution of the error term.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log-Log~…a linear model where the left-hand side variable is the log of a dependent variable specifying for the number of new drugs in a specific category and right-hand side variables include the log of the potential market size, a series of contros, and a dummy that equals 1 when the number of new drugs is equal to 0.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Profiles~…age profiles of expenditure and use for different type of drugs obtained from micro drug consumption data, and the changes in United States demographics from the Current Population Survey data.
183~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in order to measure changes in United States demographics in order to derive age profiles of expenditure and use for different types of drugs.
183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~…data on drug consumption used in order to derive age profiles of expenditure and use for different ypes of drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…the researcher's income-based measure of potential market size is dependent on the income of individuals in a specific age group at a specific time in the United States and the age profile for a certain drug category.
183~D1, D2~L4~Derived Variable~Age-Based Total Income~…the income of individuals in an age group at a specific time in the United States.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Profiles~…the age profile for a specific drug category
183~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Profiles~…computed as the average expenditure share of drugs in a category in the total income of those in a specific age group.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…the income based measure of this variable corresponds closely to the market size in the theoretical model, which is a combination of the number of consumers and their incomes.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Alternative Potential Market Size~…in order to check the robustness of results researchers use an alternative population-based measure of potential market size calculated using the United States population for a certain age group at a specific time and the average number of drugs in a certain category used per person in a certain age group.
183~D2, D3~DV15~Derived Variable~Average Number of Drugs Per Person~…the average number of drugs in a certain category used per person in a certain age group used in order to calculate an alternative measure of potential market size.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Alternative Potential Market Size~…it is important that the over-time source of variation in bot measures is not from changes in individual use but purely from demographic changes and are not time-varying, and consequently, changes in prices and drug quality, which may result from innovations and affect consumption patterns will not cause over-time variation in potential market size.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…it is important that the over-time source of variation in bot measures is not from changes in individual use but purely from demographic changes and are not time-varying, and consequently, changes in prices and drug quality, which may result from innovations and affect consumption patterns will not cause over-time variation in potential market size.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Alternative Potential Market Size~…the researcher's baseline measure uses five-year age groups and time periods corresponding to five-year intervals, but also check the robutness of their results using single year age groups and ten-year intervals.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…the researcher's baseline measure uses five-year age groups and time periods corresponding to five-year intervals, but also check the robutness of their results using single year age groups and ten-year intervals.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Profiles~…because of data availability, researchers cannot use estimates of age profiles that predate the sample period and, therefore, the estimates of age profiles may have been affected by the availability of new drugs during the sample; however, this should not create a spurious relationship between potential market size and entry of new drugs, since all variation in potential market size is driven by aggregate demographic changes, and all of the regressions control for drug category fixed effects.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Alternative Potential Market Size~…driven by aggregate demographic changes.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Potential Market Size~…driven by aggregate demographic changes.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Poisson Model~…controls for drug category fixed effects.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Quasi-Maximum Likelihood~…controls for drug category fixed effects.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log-Log~…controls for drug category fixed effects.
183~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the demographic data come from the March Current Population Survey from 1965 to 2000.
183~D1~T1~Time Period~1965-2000~…time period from which all demographic data is derived from the March Current Population Survey.
183~D1~L4~Variable Value~Age-Based Total Income~…computed for five year age groups ranging from 0 to 4 to 90+.
183~D1~V14~Variable~Individual Income~…constructed by dividing family income equally among the members of the family.
183~D1~V15~Variable~Age Group~…for the purposes of the diagrammatic presentation, researchers aggregate the age groups into three broad categories corresponding to young, middle-aged, and elderly users.
183~V15~L5~Variable Value~Young~…an aggregated age group including individuals from age 0 to age 29.
183~V15~L6~Variable Value~Middle-Aged~…an aggregated age group inclduing individuals from age 30 to 59.
183~V15~L7~Variable Value~Elderly~…an aggregated age group including individuals from age 60 and up.
183~D1~V14~Variable~Age Group~…income and population movements of the five-year age groups within each of these broad groups are relatively similar.
183~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Age-Income Shares~…income of the corresponding age group divided by total income in that period for the three broad age groups.
183~D1~V16~Variable~Population Share~…the population share of an age group in relation to the total sample population.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…the FDA classifies all prescription drugs into 20 major drug categories, which are further subdivided into 159 categories; these categoreis are based on a combination of therapeutic intent and chemical structure.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…researchers drop four of the twenty major categories including Anesthetics, Antidotes, Radiopharmaceuticals, and Miscellaneous (because most of the items in these categories were not developed for a distinct market, while the Antidote group is dropped because there are few drugs approved and there exists little use of these drugs in the surveys) and then subdivide some of these categories according to the conditions and diseases that the drugs are used to treat: for example, within the Hematologics major category, researchers separate Anemia drugs from Anticoagulants because they treat different diseases.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…researchers subdivide broader groups when the age distribution of expenditure is sufficiently heterogeneous: for example, the indication of drugs in Estrogens/Progestins and Contraceptives overlap somewhat, but the age structure of users is quite different with 20 to 30 year-olds using contraceptives most, while 50 to 60 year-olds use Estrogens/Progestins most.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…researchers end with a classifictation system with 33 categories.

183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~…a sample of United States households over the years 1996 to 1998.
183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~...this survey has age and income data for each household member, and covers about 28,000 individuals for each year.
183~D2~T2~Time Period~1996-1998~…survey period from which all drug consumption data and some age and income data is drawn from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~…this data includes a list of prescription drugs used by each person, if any, and the amount spent on drugs, which includes copayments and payments by insurance companies and government programs with a total of 500,000 medications prescribed.
183~D2~V17~Variable~Number of Drugs Per Person~…the number of prescription drugs used by each person, if any, as reported n the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
183~D2, D3~V18~Variable~Drug Expenditures~…the amount spent on drugs for individual, which includes copayments and payments by insurance companies and government programs as reported in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~…respondents list the pharmacy or medical provider where they obtained the prescription drug, which are then contacted to validate this information on prescription drug payments.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Age Profiles~…researchers compute drug expenditure and use by five-year age groups, then divide these by the corresponding income and population numbers to construct the income-based and the population-based measures of age profiles.
183~D2, D3~V18~Variable~Drug Expenditures~…divided into five-year age groups in order to compute age profiles.
183~D2~V17~Variable~Number of Drugs Per Person~…divided into five-year age groups in order to compute age profiles.
183~D3~D3~Dataset~National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey~…data used to investigate the stability of the age profile of users.
183~D3~D3~Dataset~National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey~…an annual survey of doctors working in private practice and includes drug used data for the years 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 to 2000.
183~D3~T3~Time Period~1980, 1981, 1985, 1989-2000~…survey period from which drug use data is available in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.
183~D3~D3~Dataset~National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey~…observations are at the doctor-patient-visit level with about 40,000 visits per year; doctors are selected randomly, surveyed for a week, and patient vistits are then selected randomly from all the visits that week.
183~D3~D3~Dataset~National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey~…uses the same drug classification system as with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
183~D3~D3~Dataset~National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey~…because this data does not contain expenditure information and its sampling scheme makes it less representative and less reliable than the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, this data is used mainly to check the stability of the age profiles of users.
183~D2, D3~DV17~Derived Variable~Mean Correlation By Drug~…constructed by computing the within category correlation between the measures and then averaging it across all categories.
183~D2, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Drug Expenditure Shares~…the proportion of drug expenditures to total income for each individual.
183~D2, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Drug Expenditure Shares~…because income data from the Current Population Survey are more reliable, researhcers use estimates from the Current Population Survey to construct exenditure shares.
183~D4~DV19~Derived Variable~Share of FDA Approvals~…computed as approvals of drugs in the corresponding broad age group divided by total approvals in that period, calculated from the FDA data set of New Drug Approvals
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…researchers exclude over-the-counter drugs, the so-called orphan drugs (drugs that treat rare conditions, affecting fewer than 200,000 people), and drugs that have the same identifying characteristics (same name, company, and category, or same FDA approval number).
183~D4~T4~Time Period~1970-2000~…the relevant survey period of interest from which FDA approval data is drawn from.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…this paper focuses on data drawn from the 1970 to 200 time period.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…both the quality of the approvals data and the quality of measures of potential market size deterioriate as researchers go back in time because they can only match FDA categories for drugs that are still listed by the FDA, because they cannot separately identify generics and nongenerics before 1970, and because age profiles are used from the 1990s.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…this approvals data set comprises 5,374 prescription drugs, including both generics and nongenerics; since 1970 there have been 2,203 nongeneric approvals and 442 new molecular entities.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Quasi-Maximum Likelihood~…in this equation researcher use basic income-based measure of potential market share, constructed using expenditure data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and income from the Current Population Survey, time periods correspond to five-year intervals, and observations are weighted by total expenditures in the corresponding drug category in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F1~Findings~QML on Log of Potential Market Size~…the QML estimate of the coefficient of interest on the log of potential market size for all new drugs is 6.15 with a standard error of 1.23, which is significant at the 1% level.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…throughout this data, there are large fluctuations in the total number of approvals, partly because of a number of institutional changes
183~D4~T4~Time Period~1970-2000~…throughout this survey period, there are large fluctuations in the total number of approvals, partly because of a number of institutional changes
183~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~QML on Current and Lead Market Size I~…when current and lead market sizes are included together, current market size is not significant, whereas lead market size is significant at 5%.
183~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~QML on Current and Lead Market Size II~…lead market size has a somewhat larger effect than current market size than current market size with an estimate of the coefficient equalling 7.57 with a standard error of 1.99.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F5~Findings~Potential Market Size and New Nongeneric Drugs~…when the relationship between potential market size and entry of new nongeneric drugs is analyzed, the estimate of the coefficient of interest equals 3.82, with standard error 1.15, which is also significant at the 1% level.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…there are 442 new molecular entities and 2,203 new nongenerics in the dataset.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F6~Findings~Potential Market Size and New Molecular Entities~…there exists a significant relationship between market size and new molecular entities with an estimated coefficient of 3.54 with a standard error of 1.19, statistically significant at the 1% level.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Drug Type and Current Market Size~…while all nongenerics are most responsive to current market size, the coefficient of lead market is larger with new molecular entities, 5.75, though the standard error is also larger, 2.37, evidence that is consistent with a limited anticipation effect in the response of innovation to market size.
183~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Lagged Market Size~…researchers construct the lagged market size measures for 1960 using demographic information from the Current Population Survey, so the number of observations does not decline.
183~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~Potential Market Size and Generics~…when showing the effect of potential market size on the entry of generics, the estimate of the coefficient of interest in the baseline specification is 11.81 with a standard error of 3.30, an effect that is considerably larger than those obtained in related cross-sectional studies, partly due in fact to the complex entry dynamics of generic drugs, although these researchers did not find any evidence of such dynamics in their preliminary investigations.
183~D3~D3~Dataset~National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey~…source of data used in order to investigate whether the difference between actual and potential market size might affect the magnitude of resulting estimates, as actual market size can be measured in terms of total use in each drug category between 1980 and 2000.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Actual Market Size by Category and Alternative Potential Market Size~…a simple regression of actual market size in each drug category on the reseacher's measure of population-based potential market size and category and period dummies yields a coefficient of 4.06 with a standard error of 1.60, which suggests that between 1980 and 2000 actual market size went up by 4% for every 1% increase in potential market size; assuming that this relationship also applies to the entire sample and to the income-based measure of market size, the researchers estimates of 4% to 6% response to potential market size are consistent with a proportional relationship between entry of new drugs and actual market size.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F10~Findings~Flow of New Drugs and Stock of Drugs Result Check~…to check for the possibility that the flow of new drugs may differ from the effect on the stock of drugs researchers estimate the basic models using the stock of drugs at a certain time as the independent variable leading to slightly smaller estimates of 1.84 with a standard error of 0.98 for nongenerics, and 3.10 with a standard error of 1.06 for new molecular entities, results that are consistent with a broadly similar and somewhat smaller response of the stock of drugs to market size than the response of the flow of new drugs.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F11~Findings~QML w/o Time Effects~…if researchers estimate the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood model for nongenerics without time effects, coefficients of 0.22 with a standard error of 0.9 is obtained and for new molecular entities, the estimate is 0.41, with a standard error of 0.06, a finding that is consistent with the view that the response of the composition of research and development expenditures to market size is quite different from the response of total research and development expenditures.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F12~Findings~Ten-Year Time Periods~…when time periods are altered to equal ten years instead of five-year intervals, the estimate of the coefficient of interest for nongenerics is somewhat larger, 4.81 with a standard error of 1.31, while the estimate for new molecular entities is similar to the baseline, 3.91 with a standard error of 1.29, with both estimates significant at the 1% level.
183~D1, D2, D3~F13~Findings~Market Size and Population Changes~…when looking at the effect of changes in market size driven purely by population changes (in this case, regression weights are total use in the corresponding category in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) estimates in both panels are larger than the baseline and continue to be significant at the 1% level with coefficients of 5.35 for nongenerics and 5.13 for new molecular entities.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…used in order to weight regressions depending on the total use in the corresponding category in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
183~DV1~L41~Variable Value~OECD Market Size~…combines West European and Japanese deomgraphic information with the United States information.
183~DV1~L41~Variable Value~OECD Market Size~…since researchers only have information on population for the other countries, this measure is only performed for the population-based measure of market size.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F14~Findings~United States vs OECD Market Size and Age Group~…the United States and OECD populations by age group have a high correlation, equal to 0.81.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F15~Findings~OECD Market Size by Drug Group~…using the OECD market size measure leads to similar and somewhat surprisingly, more precise results; for all nongenerics, the estimate of the coefficient of interest is 3.27 with a standard error of 0.86 and for new molecular entities, the estimate is 3.28 with a standard error of 0.84.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F16~Findings~Unweighted Estimates~…when investigating the effect of weighting on the estimates, the unweighted estimate of the coefficient for all nongenerics is smaller than the baseline at 1.81 with a standard error of 1.61, and no longer statistically significant, while for new molecular entities the estimate is larger and still significant at 4.62 with a standard error of 1.98; in both cases, the standard errors are significantly larger, reflecting the fact that expenditure shares in smaller cells are less precisely estimated.
183~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Alternative Potential Market Size~…an alternative measure of market size constructed with single-age groups for age-based income and age profiles
183~D1, D2, D3~DV14~Derived Variable~Alternative Potential Market Size~…this measure uses more information about the age profiles, but since there are fewer observations in some single-age groups, the estimates of age profiles are less precise.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F17~Findings~Alternative Potential Market Size by Drug Group~…estimates of the coefficient of interest using an alternative measure of potential market size equal 3.67 with a standard error of 1.18 for nongenerics and 3.35 with a standard error of 1.23 for new molecular entities.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F18~Findings~Income-Based Market Size and Population-Based Market Size~…instrumenting the income-based market size measure with the population-based market size measure leads to similar estimates of the baseline with the estimate for nongenerics equalling 4.07 and the estimate for new molecular entities equalling 3.84.
183~D5~D5~Dataset~United Nations~…a source of population measures and other values utilized in order to compute OECD market size.
183~D2, D3~DV21~Derived Variable~Alternative Drug Categories~..an alternative classification system from Acemoglu and Linn, which uses only differences in the age profiles of expenditures to subdivide the major FDA categories, containing a total of 34 categories, and because it includes a number of small FDA detailed categories that are dropped from the current system, there are now 106 more approvals.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F19~Findings~Alternative Drug Categories and Age Profiles of Expenditure~…when using an alternative classification system from Acemoglu and Linn (2003), which uses only differences in the age profles of expenditure to subdivide the major FDA categories, which includes 34 categories and because it includes a number of small FDA detailed categories that are dropped from the current system, there are now 106 more approvals, the estimate for nongenerics is similar to the baseline column with an estimated coefficient of 3.68 with a standard error of 1.07, while the estimate for the new molecular entities is smaller than the baseline and insignificant; however, with this classification system there is a stronger effect of lead market size on new molecular entities, for example, the estimate of the coefficient with new molecular entities and lead market size is 6.81 with a standard error of 1.29, which is significant at the 1% level.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F20~Findings~Log-Log Results by Drug Category~…when estimating the log-log model with the Pakes-Griliches transformation using ordinary least-squares, the results are similar to the baseline specifcation: for nongeneric, the estimate of the coefficient is 3.37 with a standard error of 1.75, and for new molecular entities it is 3.54 with a standard error of 1.40.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M3~Methodology~Log-Log~…researchers use this linear model in some specifications to document that the relationship we observe is not driven by outliers.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Quasi-Maximum Likelihood~…an estimation of this form with a lagged dependent variable specification as a simple way to check for serial correlation.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F21~Findings~QML w/ Lagged Dependent Variable Results by Drug Group~…when running QML regressions with a lagged dependent variable the estimated coefficient for nongenerics is 3.84 with a standard error of 1.07, and the coefficient on the lagged entry is 0.12 with a standard error of 0.10, thus small and insignificant; the results for new molecular entities are similar.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F22~Findings~Instrumentation w/ Residuals Results by Drug Group~…when estimating a nonlinear regression with instrumentation through adding the residuals from the first-stage regressions, the coefficients are very similar to the baseline estimates in all three panels, and show no evidencve of significant effects of lagged entry: for example, for nongenerics, the estimate of the coefficent of interest is 3.98 with a standard error of 1.16 and for new molecular entities, the estimate is 3.69 with a standard error of 1.38, suggesting that the effect of potential market size on entry of nongenerics and new molecular entities is robust to controlling for lagged entry and there is no evidence of residual serial correlation.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F23~Findings~Lagged Model w/o pre-1970 Data Results by Drug Group~…estimating the lagged model without the pre-1970 data for nongenerics gives an estimate of the coefficient of 3.75 with a standard error of 1.93, and the lagged dependent variable remains very small and insignificant; this result is also true for new molecular entities.
183~D6~DV22~Derived Variable~Number of Life-Years Lost~…researchers estimate the number of life-years lost corresponding to each drug category using the Mortality Detail Files from the National Center for Health Statistics from 1970 to 1998.
183~D6~D6~Dataset~Mortality Detail Files~…data used in order to estimate the number of life-years lost corresponding to each drug category from the National Center for Health Statistics from 1970 to 1998.
183~D6~DV22~Derived Variable~Number of Life-Years Lost~…for each death, researchers subtract the person's age from 65, and then calculate the total number of life years lost for all the deaths resulting from diseases related to drugs in each category.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4, D6~F24~Findings~Total Life-Years Results by Drug Group~..when adding total life-years lost to the baseline regression models as a proxy for the source of nonprofit incentive to undertake researcher, the estimate of the effect of market size on nongenerics equals 3.58 with a standard error of 1.70 and the estimate for new molecular entities is 3.64 with a standard error of 1.79, suggesting that the variable for life-years lost is not significant.
183~D7~D7~Dataset~CRISP~…reseachers investigate the implications of differences in scientific funding for various drug categories through data from the Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects through constructing a variable measuring the total amount of federal funding for research in each drug category, and include this variable as a control.
183~D7~DV23~Derived Variable~Total Federal Funding~…a measure of the total amount of federal funding for research in each drug category included as a control in certain specifications of baseline regressions.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F25~Findings~Total Federal Funding Results by Drug Group~…including total federal funding in baseline regressions has little effect on the researcher's estimates with the effect of market size equalling 3.86 with a standard error of 1.20 for nongenerics and 3.56 with a standard error of 1.20 for new molecular entitites.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV24~Derived Variable~Preexisiting Trends~…researchers cosntruct an estimate for preexisting trends through the first-difference of log approvals for a certain drug category in 1970 and the log of approvals in 1940.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~M4~Methodology~First-Difference~…the first difference between the log of approvals for a drug of a certain category in 1970 and the log of approvals in 1940 in order to control for potential trends in scientific opporutnities across drug categories.
183~D6~DV22~Derived variable~Number of Life-Years Lost~…for example, if someone dies at age 32, this counts as 33 life-years lost; people dying older than 65 receive no weight in this calculation; since many categories contain diseases or conditions that do not lead to death, researchers obtain several empty cells.
183~D8~T5~Time Period~1974-1996~…time period through which the percentage of 60+ year olds with private insurance rose from 60% to 75% between 1974 and 1996.
183~D8~D8~Dataset~National Health Interview Survey~…data used in order to construct a market size measure incorporating information on health insurance coverage.
183~D1, D2, D3, D8~DV25~Derived Variable~Coverage Market Size~…a market size measure incorporating information on health insurance coverage dependent on the fraction of those at a certain age in a specific time period iwht private health insurance, age profiles, and age-specific income.
183~D8~D8~Dataset~National Health Interview Survey~…does not include consistent information on prescription drug coverage.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4, D8~F26~Findings~Coverage Market Size Results by Drug Group~…when coverage market size is included in the regressions instead of potential market size, for nongenerics, the estimate of the coefficient is 1.92 with standard error 0.44, while for new molecular entities, it is 2.10 with a standard error of 0.51.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F27~Findings~5-Year Prior Population Results by Drug Group ~…when instrumenting for current population using the corresponding population from five years before to check for reverse causality issues, the estimate of the coefficient is 2.93 with a standard error of 1.45 for nongenerics and 3.08 with a standard error of 1.32 suggesting no evidence of reverse causality.
183~D9~D9~Dataset~Thompson Derwent, Inc.~…data on pharmaceutical patents used to map patents into the drug classication system.
183~D1, D5~F28~Findings~Patents and United States vs. OECD Market Size Measures~…when investigating the fact that United States patents include those taken by foreign companies, and in turn turn might be more responsive to OECD demand than to United States demand, researchers find a significant relationship between five- or ten-years leads of OECD market size, with an estimated coefficient for the five year lead of 3.49 with standard error 1.02 and with the ten-year lead of 5.02 with standard error 0.63, suggesting that OECD demand may be more important for patents.
183~D1, D5~F29~Findings~United States vs. OECD ~…part of the difference between the United States and OECD results is driven by the fact that researchers are using income-based measures for the United States and the population-based measures for the OECD; using the population-based measure for the United States lead market size with patents yields a coefficient of 2.34 with a standard error of 4.63.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F30~Findings~Potential Market Size and Entry Growth~…a 1% increase in the potential market size for a drug category leads to approximately a 4% growth in the entry of new nongeneric drugs and new molecular entities.
183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~…an annual survey of randomly sampled households using the 1996, 1997 and 1998 surveys obtaining each person's age, the name and national drug code of the prescription drug(s) used, and total expenditure; over the three years there are about 500,000 drugs used and about 85,000 individuals.
183~D2, D3~V18~Derived Variable~Drug Expenditures~…includes out-of-pocket expenses, as well as amounts paid by insurance companies and government payments.
183~D2~D2~Dataset~Medical Expenditure Panel Survey~…data on expenditure source is collected from the pharmacies and medical providers listed by the respondents.
183~D2, D3~V18~Derived Variable~Drug Expenditures~...in order to compute drug expenditures by category, researchers begin with the 159 therapeutic categories, obtained from the FDA's National Drug Code Directory, and then assign each drug in the MEPS to one of the 159 categories by matching it by national drug code with a drug in the NDC file; researchers cannot match about 10% of the drugs mentioned in the MEPS, however these are usually not commonly used drugs, and make up less than 5% of the total drugs used.
183~D2, D3~DV18~Derived Variable~Drug Expenditure Shares~…calculated by computing drug expenditure by five-year age group and then dividing by the income of the group.
183~D2, D3~DV26~Derived Variable~Number of Drugs Per Person~…calculated by computing use by five-year age group and then dividing by the population of the group.
183~D2~V19~Variable~Population~…population estimates are measured from the MEPS data source (so use per person is the weighted average of use per person of respondents in the MEPS).
183~D1~V14~Variable~Individual Income~…from the Current Population Survey data because the MEPS income data are likely to contain greater measurement error as the sample is smaller, wage and salary incomes for almost half of the sample are imputed either based on broad income ranges or other information, nonwage incomes were generally imputed, and the iputation methods change between 1996 to 1997 and 1998 surveyes.
183~D1, D2, D3, D4~F31~Findings~Market Size and Entry by Drug Group~..the estimate of the effect of market size on the entry of nongenerics is 4.08 with a standard error of 1.31, and the estimate for new molecular entities is 3.59 with a standard error of 1.35.
183~D2, D3~V12~Variable~Drug Category~…researchers only observe categories with more than 1,000 observations.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…the list of FDA drug approvals were obtained by Lichtenberg and Virahbak under the Freedom of Information Act.
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…researchers match drugs in the approval list to FDA categories by drug name and FDA approval number. 
183~D4~D4~Dataset~FDA Drug Approval~…since 1970, 14,432 of 16,772 prescription drugs (86%) approved are matched, while before 1970, the match rate is about 51% motivating a focus on drug approvals between 1970 and 2000.
184~184: Market Structure and Racial Earnings: Evidence from Job-Changers~~~~
184~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
184~D1~D1~Dataset~Displaced Worker Survey~…this study uses individual data from the 1984 to 1998 biannual Displaced Worker Survey supplement to the Current Population Survey.
184~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1984-1998~…relevant survey period from which data from the Displaced Worker Survey supplement to the Current Population Survey is drawn.
184~D1~D1~Dataset~Displaced Worker Survey~…this constructed data set consists of workers aged 16 and older who were displaced from and reemployed in manufacturing industries, yielding a sample of 274 minority and 2,135 white workers.
184~D1~D1~Dataset~Displaced Worker Survey~…an advantage of using displaced workers in measuring wage change is that, because job change is involuntary, it is not the result of workers' expectations about the availability of better jobs; however, a disadvantage lies in the fact that only a fraction of survey applicants provide pre-displacement earnings, resulting in small sample sizes.
184~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…this study uses individual data from the 1984 to 1998 survey period of the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups
184~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1984-1998~…relevant survey period from which data from the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups is drawn.
184~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…a unique feature of this data is that workers appear in the survey twice, 12 months appart.
184~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…a disadvantage in taking the past literature approach of using this data to create panel data of workers lies in the fact that using the constructed Current Population Survey panel allows some job switches to be endogeneous.
184~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…yields 1,632 minority and 12,762 white workers who have changed employment over the 12 months between survey appearances.
184~D3~D3~Dataset~Census of Manufacturers~…bridged to each data set of individual workers are measures of industry characteristics from the 1987 and 1992 Census of Manufacturers, directed by the Bureau of the Census.
184~D3~T2~Time Period~1987.0~…first relevant survey year of the Census of Manufacturers.
184~D3~T2~Time Period~1987.0~…time period in which Census of Manufacturers' industry characteristics were used to describe a worker's pre-employment-change industry, if the worker's first job ended before 1992.
184~D3~T3~Time Period~1992.0~…second relevant survey year of the Census of Manufacturers.
184~D3~T3~Time Period~1992.0~…time period in which Census of Manufacturers industry characteristics were used to describe all changes occuring thereafter.
184~D3~D3~Dataset~Census of Manufacturers~…industry characteristics from the 1987 Census were used to describe a worker's pre-employment-change industry if the worker's first job ended before 1992, while the 1992 Census was used for all occuring thereafter, while characteristics of the post-employment industry were assigned similarly.
184~D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Industry Characteristics~…include the pre- and post-change capital-to-labor ratio and plant size.
184~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Capital-to-Labor Ratio~…the industry gross book value of plant and equipment divided by industry employment.
184~D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Plant Size~…industry employment divided by the number of establishments.
184~D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Four-Firm Concentration Ratios~…converted from four-digit to three-digit SIC industry coding by weighting they industry value of shipments.
184~D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Market Structure~…a switching regression technique was used to bifurcate employees into high-concentration, non-competitive industries and low-concentration competitive industries.
184~D3~V1~Variable~Critical Concentration Ratio~…the critical concentration ratio was taken to be 40%.
184~D4~D4~Dataset~Economic Report of the President~…source of the consumer price index used in order to deflate pre- and post-employment earnings to 1985 equivalent dollars.
184~D4~V2~Variable ~Consumer Price Index~…the consumer price index, used to deflate pre- and post-employment earnings to 1985 dollars, was taken from the Economic Report of the President 1998.
184~D4~T4~Time Period~1985.0~…the year of which all defalted pre- and post-employment earnings in dollar amounts are represented by.
184~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…where the change in the log of real weekly wages from pre- to post-employment in 1985 dollars is the outcome and explanatory variables include a vector of individual and industry controls that determine wage change, and dummies that account for the change in market structure.
184~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the coefficient on each variable captures the effect of that variable on earnings changes for that racial group, while the coefficients on the change-in-market-structure dummies are key because they measure the earnings change in moving to and from noncompetitive and competitive industries relative to workers who stay in competitive industries, for each racial group.
184~D1, D2, D4~DV6~Derived Variable~Weekly Wages~…as the outcome of a log-linear regression in order to determine changes in the log of real weekly wages from pre- to post-employment in 1985 dollars dependent on a variety of industry and individual characteristics.
184~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Individual and Industry Controls~…a vector of individual and industry controls that determine wage controls.
184~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Individual and Industry Controls~…individual characteristics included in this variable are age and its square, years of tenure in the pre-displacement job, six dummies for educational attainment, three dummies indicating region of employment, and four dummies indicating pre- and post-occupational group, with other individual controls including dummies for full- and part-time status in pre- and post-employment, gender and marital satus.
184~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Individual and Industry Controls~…industry variables are included in this vector to control for the effects of cahnges in industry characteristics from the pre- to the post-employment industry on earnings change for each racial group and include changes in the capital-to-labor ratio and the changes in plant size.
184~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Age~…included in a vector of individual characteristics as an explanatory variable in all regressional analysis.
184~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Age-Squared~…included in a vector of individual characteristics as an explanatory variable in all regressional analysis.

184~DV5~L3~Variable Value~C_NC~…workers moving from competitive to noncompetitive industries.
184~DV5~L4~Variable Value~C_C~…workers moving from competitive to competitive industires as the base group.
184~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Individual and Industry Controls~…using the constructed Current Population Survey panel, the vector of individual and industry characteristics differs from the above in that it does not include a control for years of tenure in the previous occupation, however dummies for union status in pre- and post-change employment are included.
184~D1, D3, D4~F1~Findings~DWS and Plant Size~…using the DWS sample, an increase in plant size from the displacement to the reemployment industry significantly decreases earnings loss for white, while it insignificantly increases the loss for minorities with coefficients of -0.032 and 0.004, respectively.
184~D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Market Structure~…of central importance are the results for the change in market-structure dummies in this research paper.
184~D1, D3, D4~F2~Findings~DWS and Market Structure Changes for Minorities~…using the DWS sample, for minorities whose initial employment is in competitive industries, joining a noncompetitive industry significantly reduces earnings loss by 68 percentage points relative to reamining in competitive industries.
184~D1, D3, D4~F3~Findings~DWS and Market Structure Changes for Whites~…using the DWS sample, joining a noncompetitive industry significantly reduces earnings loss of whites by 8.8 percentage points relative to remaining in competitive industries.
184~D1, D3, D4~F4~Findings~DWS and t-test for Market Structure~…using the DWS sample, the t test of the difference between the noncompetitive to noncompetitive, and noncompetitive to competitive variables for white displaced workers fails to reject the hypothesis of equal wage loss for noncompetitive industry non-leavers and leavers with the t statistics equalling -0.78.
184~D1, D3, D4~F5~Findings~DWS and t-test for Non-leavers and Leavers~…using the DWS sample, the t test of the difference between minority non-leavers and leavers in noncompetitive industries just barely fails to reject the hypothesis of equal wage loss between the two groups yielding a t statisitic of -1.5.
184~D2, D3, D4~F6~Findings~Matched Panel Data and Plant Size~…using the matched panel data, an increase in plant size for whites significantly reduces earnings loss by 0.03 percentage points, while it insignificantly influences wage changes for minorities.
184~D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Matched Panel data and Market Structure~…using the matched panel data, the market structure dummies are insignificant in both the white and minority equations, with the exepection of the significant coefficient on competitive to noncompetitive workers for minority workers, which significantly reduces earnings loss for minorities by 7.2 percentage points, suggesting that minorities are beneficiaries of labor rent-sharing.
184~D2~D2~Dataset~ORG Current Population Survey~…the matched panel data is later divided into four variants of the job switch market structure groupings for each racial group.
184~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Difference-in-Differences~…after baseline DWS and matched panel data regressions are ran, the ORG panels are divided into the four variants of the job-switch market-structure groupings for each racial group and separate wage equations are estimated for each sample before and afte the job change, a procedure that removes the fixed-effects restriction on earnings changes for workers entering and leaving noncompetitive industries and allows a separate earnings structure before and after the job switch and by market structure while also allowing difference-in-differences estimates of the difference in wage change or minorities and whites entering and leaving noncompetitive industries.
184~D2, D3, D4~F8~Findings~Difference-in-Differences and Earnings Loss for Whites and Minorities~…using the difference-in-differences model, earnings losses for minorities and whites leaving noncompetitive industries are 12.51 and 3.77 percentage points respectively.
184~D2, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Difference-in-Differences and Market Structure Change by Race I~…using the difference-in-differences model, leaving a noncompetitive industry causes an 18.92 percentage-point greater earnings loss for minorities and an 8.84 percentage-point greater loss for whites than the loss of workers belonging to each racial group remaining in a noncompetitiv eindustry.
184~D2, D3, D4~F10~Findings~Difference-in-Differences and Market Structure Change by Race II~…using the difference-in-differences model, movement to a noncompetitive industry invokes earnings gains of 15.16 and 5.52 percentage points for minorities and whites, respectively, with minorities and whites experiencing 14.0 and 7.55 percentage-point larger gains than those in competitive industiries.

185~185: Mariage and Divorce: Comment~~~~
185~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
185~D1~V1~Variable~Fault Divorce-Law ~…under fault law divorce, the spouse most wanting to leave the realtionship must purchase the right to leave; failure to reach an agreement here implies that the total value of the marriage is greater than the value of a separation.
185~D1~V2~Variable~No-Fault Divorce-Law~…with no-fault law, the spouse least wanting to divorce must pay the other to stay; failure to reach an agreement here implies that the total value of separation is greater than the value of the marriage.
185~D1~V3~Variable~Divorce Rate~…Peters (a previous researcher whose findings the current researcher is attempting to debunk) finds that the divorce rate is unaffected by legal change.
185~D1~D1~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey~…the data used by Peters is a special 1979 Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey that is matched with the March/April 1979 Current Population Survey.
185~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data used by Peters is a special 1979 Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey that is matched with the March/April 1979 Current Population Survey.
185~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1979.0~…relevant source year from which Peters' special data source is drawn from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey and the March/April Current Population Survey.
185~D1~D1~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey~…this survey collects information on divorce, property settlements, and other demographic variables.
185~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1970-1985~…the switch to no-fault divorce started in 1970 with California and ended in 1985 with South Dakota.
185~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data allowed Peters to examine the divorce rate between 1975 and 1978, right in the middle of the transition from fault divorce to no-fault divorce. 
185~D2~T3~Time Period~1975-1978~…time period from which the Current Population Survey allows examination of the divorce rate.
185~D2~T3~Time Period~1975-1978~…although seven states were in transition during 1975-1978, three states required agreement on property settlements and so remained fault states in spirit, with Montana changing so early in 1975 that all divorces within the sample took place after the change, and so there is no problem in coding it as a no-fault state; the main problem in Peter's wo.rk arises with the three remaining states, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wyoming, because some divorces within the sample took place before and some took place after the change
185~D1, D2~V4~Variable~State ~…in order to differentiate between state laws regarding over time.
185~V4~L1~Variable Value~Montana~…a state that changed so early in 1975 that all divorces within the sample took place after the change, and so there is no problem in Peters' results in coding it as a no-fault state.
185~V4~L2~Variable Value~Massachusetts~…some divorces within the relevant sample period in this state took place before and some took place after the change in law.
185~V4~L3~Variable Value~Rhode Island~…some divorces within the relevant sample period in this state took place before and some took place after the change in law.
185~V4~L4~Variable Value~Wyoming~…some divorces within the relevant sample period in this state took place before and some took place after the change in law.
185~V4~L4~Variable Value~Wyoming~….became a no-fault divorce state in 1977.
185~V4~L4~Variable Value~Wyoming~…in Peters' sample taken from the Current Population Survey, there are 195 women from Wyoming, 11 of whom divorced, all prior to 1977; one way to picture what Peters has done with Wyoming is to imagine that she creates two states: Wyoming-1 has a fault law; Wyoming-2 has a no-fault law; since all of the divorces occured before 1977, all of the divorce observations are in Wyoming-1, the fault state, and the remaining nondivorced were placed in Wyoming-2.
185~V4~L5~Variable Value~Iowa~…a state that was not in legal transition during the relevant sample period.
185~D1~V1~Variable~Fault Divorce-Law ~…for the purposes of Peter's test, a state should be classified as either fault or no-fault; that is, each state should have a cross-tabulation with a row of zeros.
185~D1~V2~Variable~No-Fault Divorce-Law~…for the purposes of Peter's test, a state should be classified as either fault or no-fault; that is, each state should have a cross-tabulation with a row of zeros.
185~V4~L2~Variable Value~Massachusetts~…by keeping the three transition states in the sample, the married women must be arbitrarily assigned as living in either a fault or no-fault state.
185~V4~L3~Variable Value~Rhode Island~…by keeping the three transition states in the sample, the married women must be arbitrarily assigned as living in either a fault or no-fault state.
185~V4~L4~Variable Value~Wyoming~…by keeping the three transition states in the sample, the married women must be arbitrarily assigned as living in either a fault or no-fault state.
185~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Divorce~…a binary dependent variable equal to 1 if a woman divorced between 1975 and 1978.
185~D2~V6~Variable~Age~…the age of a woman in 1979.
185~D2~V7~Variable~Education~…the number of years attended school as of 1979.
185~D2~V8~Variable~White~…a binary explanatory variable equal to 1 if the woman as white.
185~D2~V9~Variable~Kids<18~…the number of children younger than 18 within the household as of 1979.
185~D2~V10~Variable~Kids Squared~…kids<18 multiplied by kids<18.
185~D2~V11~Variable~SMSA~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the woman lived in a standard metropolitan statistical area in 1979.
185~D2~V12~Variable~South~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the household was located in southern United States.
185~D2~V13~Variable~West~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the household was located in western United States.
185~D2~V14~Variable~North-Central~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the household was located in north-central United States.
185~V2~L6~Variable Value~No-Fault Divorce-Law 1~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the state has a no-fault divorce law corresponding to Peter's classification.
185~V2~L7~Variable Value~No-Fault Divorce-Law 2~…a binary variable equal to 1 if the state has a no-fault divorce law (some separation states coded no-fault).
185~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…Peters' sample includes all 50 states while the current researcher's sample omits Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wyoming.
185~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the regression labelled Peter-1 reveals the effects of including the three transition effects by replicating the regression performed by Peters (1986) with the dependent variable as the probability of becoming divorced during 1975 to 1978 given no previous divroces
185~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the regression labelled Allen-1 use Peters' data set, with the only difference being that the three states in question have been removed from the sample.
185~V4~L2~Variable Value~Massachusetts~…the three transition states make up only 4% of the observation sample.
185~V4~L3~Variable Value~Rhode Island~…the three transition states make up only 4% of the observation sample.
185~V4~L4~Variable Value~Wyoming~…the three transition states make up only 4% of the observation sample.
185~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Peters-1 and Allen-1 No-Fault Coefficient Estiamtes~…in the Peters-1 regression, the no-fault-1 coefficient is 0.01 and has a chi-square statistic equal to zero; however, by excluding the three states, the coefficient for no-fault-1 becomes positive and significant at the 10% level with a coefficient magnitude of 0.63, providing further evidence that a classification error was made because when an independent variable contains measurement errors, the coefficient is biased toward zero.
185~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…it is difficult to justify the use of region dummies in this regression.
185~D2~V4~Variable~State ~…with the exceptions of Utah and South Dakota, all of the faul states either border on the Mississippi or lie east of it.
185~D2~V14~Variable~North-Central~…because all of the fault states either border on the Mississippi or lie east of it, with the exception of Utah and South Dakota, there is a large degree of correlation between the North Central dummy and the no-fault variable.
185~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…regression Allen-2 shows the result of dropping the regional dummies along with the three states mentioned earlier.
185~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Allen-2 Coeffient Estimate~…rather than a low coefficient and a zero chi-square, the removal of the regional dummies leads to a coefficient of 1.42 (second in size only to that for the presence of children) with a chi-square statistic of 17.64.
185~V2~L8~Variable Value~Separation Law~…states with separation laws comprise one class of no-fault states in which couples need only be separated for a given period of time before a divorce is granted before a divorce is granted.
185~V2~L8~Variable Value~Separation Law~…separation states are legally defined as no-fault states, and in many cases may be considered no-fault states in an economic sense as well; however, not all separation states are the same due to the fact that some may require the separation to be mutually agreed upon, which in effect maintains a fault nature to the divorce law.
185~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the Allen-3 regression shows the results of reclassifying separation states that are unambiguously no-fault.
185~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Allen-3  and Allen-4 Coefficient Estimates~…the Allen-3 regression shows significance in the inclusion of regional dummies with coefficients of 1.57, 2.77, and 1.74, respectively; however, the removal of regional dummy variables in Allen-4 regressions leads to a high magnitude and significant coefficient on no-fault 2 of 1.37.
185~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the Allen-4 regression shows the results of reclassifying separation states that are unambiguously no-fault with the removal of region-specific dummy variables.
185~V4~L9~Variable Value~Arkansas~…a separation state that may be considered a no-fault state.
185~V4~L10~Variable Value~Louisiana~…a separation state that may be considered a no-fault state.
185~V4~L11~Variable Value~South Carolina~…a separation state that may be considered a no-fault state.
185~V4~L12~Variable Value~Utah~…a separation state that may be considered a no-fault state.
185~V4~L13~Variable Value~Vermont~…a separation state that may be considered a no-fault state.
185~V4~L14~Variable Value~Virginia~…a separation state that may be considered a no-fault state.
185~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Divorce~…according to Peters, divorces only occur when one party cannot compensate the other to stay or to leave, i.e. the net gain to marriage is negative, the direction of compensation depending on whether a state has a fault or no-fault divorce law; in a world of zero transaction costs, this would be the case, however, we live in no surch world, and a as a result, property-right allocations are not neutral.
185~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Transaction Costs~…Peters derived her results using the Coase theorem, implicitly assuming zero transaction costs.
185~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Transaction Costs~…Coase assumes that prices allocate resources without costs, an assumption that necessarily implies that transaction costs are zero and that property rights are perectly defined.
185~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Property Rights~…Coase assumes that prices allocate resources without costs, an assumption that necessarily implies that transaction costs are zero and that property rights are perectly defined.
185~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Property Rights~…if property rights are not perfect then resources are devoted toward their protection and caputre, and transaction costs are positive.
185~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Transaction Costs~…zero transaction costs and perfectly defined property rights are the same thing.
185~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Property Rights~…zero transaction costs and perfectly defined property rights are the same thing.
185~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Property Rights~…since perfect ownership does not admit theft, all transfers must be purchased in a zero-transaction-cost world, that is alterations in property rights must be accompanied by appropriate compensation; if this is not the case, then the rights are not perfectly defined, and therefore, transaction costs exist. 
185~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Positive Transaction Costs or Zero Transaction Costs~…though Peters claims a model with zero transaction costs, her empirical work has a transaction-cost foundation.
185~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Transaction Costs~…arise from establishing and protecting one's property rights and result from the possibility of involuntary transfers of wealth, from which marriage is not exempt.

186~V5~L1~Variable Value~California~…a state with higher divorce rates than average and also that is a well known innovator in the adoption of new legislation/
186~D2, D4~V6~Variable~Divorce Rate~…high divorce rates are correlated with the adoption of new laws but are not necessarily caused by those laws.
186~D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~1970 State Divorce Rate~…a direct solution for the problem of unobserved heterogeneity is to measure differences in behavior before and after any change in the law by including a proxy for the unobserved state-specific propensity to divorce, seen through the state divorce rate in 1970, a time period before the changes in divorce laws.
186~D2, D4~T1~Time Period~1970.0~…year when the unobserved state-specific porpensity to divorced can be proxied for through the state divorce rate in 1970, a time period before the changes in divorce laws
186~V5~L1~Variable Value~California~…began the no-fault revolution by adopting a unilateral-divorce law in 1970.
186~D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~1970 State Divorce Rate~…the importance of including this variable in the analysis is that in the researcher's earlier analysis, she found that states with higher 1970 divorce rates were more likely to adopt a unilateral divorce rule, thus leaving out the 1970 divorce rate would result in an upward bias on the estimated effect of unilateral divorce.
186~D2, D5~V7~Variable~Unilateral-Divorce States~…defined as those states that adopted a unilateral divorce law before 1980.

186~D1, D3, D4~F1~Findings~1970 Divorce Rate and Unilateral-Divorce Law~…there exists a strong positive correlation between the 1970 state divorce rate and the adoption of a unilateral-divorce law before 1980 with a significant coefficient of 0.403.
186~D3, D4, D5~F2~Findings~Unilateral-Divorce Law and 1980 Divorce Rate~…there exists a strong positive correlation between the divorce law and the 1980 divorce rate with a significant coefficnet of 0.292.
186~D1, D3, D4~F3~Findings~Western States and Divorce Rates~…western states have higher divorce rates, both before and after change in the law, and are more likely to have adopted a unilateral-divorce law with coefficients of 0.554 on the 1970 state divorce rate, 0.481 on the 1980 state divorce rate, and 0.390 on the unilateral divorce law variable.

186~D1, D3, D4, D5~F7~Findings~1970 Divorce Rate Impact on Current Survey Data~…an increase in the 1970 state divorce rate of 1 percentage point increases the probability of divorce in the Current Population Survey sample by between 0.88 and 1.06 percetange points, indicating that unilateral-divorce laws do not significantly increase the probability of divorce when the regression controls for the state-specific propensity to divorce.
186~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the sample used in illustrating the impact of different specifications on the estimate of the divorce laws coefficient is the same as in Allen (1992), exlcuding individuals living in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wyoming with alterations progressing by first excluding regional variables and excluding 1970 state divorce rates, then including regional variables and excluding the 1970 state divorce rate, then excluding regional variables and including the 1970 divorce rate and finally including regional variables and including the 1970 state divorce rate..
186~D3, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~1970 State Divorce Rate~…defined as the number of divorces per 100 women at risk.
186~DV1~L8~Variable Value~1970 California Divorce Rate~…measured during 1969 for California as this state was the first to pass a no-fault divorce law in 1970.
186~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…used in order to report the results of regressing state divorce rates on aggregate state characteristics and the state divorce law, using the 1980 divorce rate as the dependent variable and does not control for the state-specific propensity to divorce; alternate specifications include using only observations for 1980 and pooling data from 1970 and 1980.
186~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F8~Findings~1980 Divorce Rate and Unilateral Divorce-Law~…in subsequent regressions with the 1980 divorce rate as the dependent variable, the coefficient on the unilateral law variable is positive and significant with a magnitude of 0.831.

186~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F9~Findings~1980 Observations Only and Unilateral Divorce-Law~…in the specification where only 1980 observations are included, the coefficient on the unilateral divorce-law variable is 0.032 and not statistically significant.
186~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F10~Findings~1970 and 1980 Pooled Data and Unilateral Divorce-Law Variable~…in the specification where 1970 and 1980 data are pooled together, the coefficient on the unilateral divorce-law variable is -0.043 and not statistically significant.
186~D1, D3, D4~V15~Variable~Year Dummies~…a year dummy is included in 1970 and 1980 pooled data regressions to represent the average increase in divorce rates over the decade.
186~D1, D4~V16~Variable~State Dummies~…state dummies are included in 1970 and 1980 pooled data regressions to control for a given state's average deviation from the regression line over the two years.
186~D1, D3, D4, D5~V17~Variable~Divorce~…according to a model developed by Ronald Coase, divorce will occur only when the joint value of marriage is less than the sum of each spouse's value from getting divorced.
186~D5~V7~Variable~Unilateral-Divorce Laws~…unilateral-divorce laws are characterized as mechanisms that assign the property rights to dissolve the marriage.
186~D5~V18~Variable~Mutual-Divorce Laws~…unilateral-divorce laws are characterized as mechanisms that assign the property rights to dissolve the marriage.
186~D5~V7~Variable~Unilateral-Divorce Laws~…gives the right of assigning property rights to the spouse who does want a divorce.
186~D5~V18~Variable~Mutual-Divorce Laws~…gives the right of assigning property rights to the spouse who does not want the divorce.
186~D1, D3, D4, D5~V17~Variable~Divorce~…the probability of divorce is independent of the assignment of property rights, if there are no barriers to the enforcement of private contracting.
186~~V19~Variable~Transaction Costs~…divided into three categories including technical constraints on bargaining, legal costs, and rent-seeking behavior.
186~V19~L9~Variable Value~Technical Constraints to Bargaining~…the most important assumption behind the argument that divorce rates are the same in both legal regimes is that these costs are negligible.
186~V19~L9~Variable Value~Technical Constraints to Bargaining~…examples of transaction costs that fall into this category are indivisibilities and private information.
186~V19~L9~Variable Value~Technical Constraints to Bargaining~…if each spouse cannot observe how much the other spouse values divorce, an efficient contract based on actual outcomes cannot be enforce; in addition, if the gains from divorce cannot be easily converted into money or some other medium of exchange, then the transfers that enable efficient outcomes cannot be made. Under these circumstances, the two parties may adopt alternative aggrements, such as a rigid wage contract which leads to the prediction that divorce rates should be higher in unilateral-divorce states.
186~V19~L9~Variable Value~Technical Constraints to Bargaining~…the empirical evidence that divorce rates are not higher in unilateral-divorce state supports the argument that this type of transaction cost is not statistically important in divorce decisions.
186~V19~L10~Variable Value~Legal Costs~…can be viewed as a kind of tax on divorce.
186~V19~L10~Variable Value~Legal Costs~…examples of this kind of cost include waiting times to divorce, filing fees and other court fees.
186~V19~L10~Variable Value~Legal Costs~…any economic theory of divorce would predict that lowering the costs of divorce should raise the probability of divorce.
186~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Transaction Costs~…the second assumption necessary for divorce rates to be independent of the assignement of property rights is for all other transaction costs to be the same across the two legal regimes.
186~D5~V7~Variable~Unilateral-Divorce Laws~…although it is a common idea in popular writing that unilateral divorce is equivalent to low-cost divorce, this idea is not strongly supported by statistical evidence.
186~D5~V20~Variable~Property Rights~…if property rights are not well-defined, it will be in the interest of some individuals to change the law, and it will be in the interest of other individuals to keep the law, thus, the existence of this kind of transactions cost is irrelevant to the differential probability of divorce, because the incentive to incur resources to change the law is the same under either regime.
186~V19~L9~Variable Value~Technical Constraints to Bargaining~…transaction costs that prevent individuals from fully exploiting the joint gains to any action, the existence of which could lead to rigid wage contracts in which the probability of divorce depends on which party holds the property right divorce.

187~187: Match Bias from Earnings Imputations in the Current Population survey: The Case of Imperfect Matching~~~~
187~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the CPS monthly earnings files have earnings and wages imputed by the Census using a ""cell hot deck"" procedure, in which the Census ""allocates"" (assigns) to nonrespondents the reported earnings of a matched donor who has an identical mix of  measured attributes."
187~D1~T1~Time Period~1979-2004~…the full relevant sample period from which Current Population Survey data was drawn for the purposes of this research.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the proportion of imputed earners was approximately 15% from 1979 to 1993, increased as a result of CPS revisions in 1994, and has risen in recent years to almost 30%.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Census includes earnings of both respondents and nonrespondents in published tabulations of earnings and other outcomes of interest.
187~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Match Bias~"…match bias associated with ""nonmatch"" attributes (i.e., those not included as Census match criteria) is a first-order problem. "
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Census uses broad categories to match donors' earnings with nonrespondents. For example, rather than matching on the exact age, individuals are grouped into six age categories. Similar, Census uses three education categories.
187~D1~V1~Variable~Age~…the Census uses six broad categories of age to match donor's earnings with nonrespondents.
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…the Census uses three education categories to match donor's earnings with nonrespondents.
187~V2~L1~Variable Value~Low~…one of three aggregate education categories used in the Census.
187~V2~L2~Variable Value~Middle~…one of three aggregate education categories used in the Census.
187~V2~L3~Variable Value~High~…one of three aggregate education categories used in the Census.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…this article presents a general framework for examining match bias due to earnings imputation, deriving an analytic general bias measure under the assumption of conditional mean missing at random (CMMAR). Using this framework, researchers first formalize expressions for bias in the case of dummy variables of nonmatch attributes. Then, various cases of incomplete match are examined. Finally, researchers derive a set of corrections for incomplete match bias, demonstrate their use in several examples, and compare alternative approaches researhers might take to account for match bias.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…analysis in this article uses the CPS Outgoing Rotation Group (ORG) monthly earnings files, prepared by the Census for use by the BLS, which then makes these files publicly available. An earnings supplement is administered to the quarter sample of employed wage and salary workers in their outgoing fourth and eight months included in the survey.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample design of the CPS is that individuals are included in the survey for 8 months - 4 consecutive months in the survey followed by 8 months out, followed by 4 months in (the same month as in the previous year).
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS-ORG earnings files begin in 1979. They are typically used as annual files, including the 12 quarter sample during a calendar year.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…during the period 1979 to 1993, approximately 15% of employed wage and salary workers had imputed values included for usual weekly earnings. The CPS earnings questions were revised in 1994. The increased complexity and sequencing of earnings questions led to a substantial increase in imputation rates. Publicly available earnings files for January 1994 through August 1995 do not identify those with imputed earnings. Beginning in September 1995, valid earnings allocation flags are included. Imputations rose from about 22% in 1996 to about 30% in the period from 2000 to 2004.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…prior to 1979, the earnings supplement was administered to all rotation groups in May 1973 through May 1979. Nonrespondents are included in the May 1973 to 1978 earnings files, but they do not have their earnings imputed. Approximately 20% of employed wage and salary workers in the May 1973 to 1978 files have no value (or the ""missing"" value) included in the usual weekly earnings field."
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…earnings allocation flags are not reliable during the period 1989 to 1993. Imputed earners can be identified based on those who do and do not have an entry in the unedited usual weekly earnings field.

The Census keeps all cells ""stocked with a single donor, ensuring that an exact match is always found. The donor in each cell is the most recent earnings respondent surveyed by the Census with that exact combination of characteristics. As each surveyed worker reports an earnings value, the Census goes to the appropriate cell, removes the previous donor value, and refreshes that cell with a new earnings value from the respondent."

187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…throughout the analysis, the variable y(i) is the dependent variable in a linear regression, in this case, the natural log of earnings. The variables z(i) are the regressors of interest, for example, age and education. The variables x(i) represent the categories upon which matches are made. These variables are binary indicator (dummy) variables in practice, but the current analysis does not rely upon this result.
187~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Earnings~…the natural log of earnings as included in linear regressions used to derive a general analytic approach to evaluate bias from the inclusion of imputed values in the dependent variable.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…ASSUMPTION 1: only the dependent variable is missing, for some but not all observations. This assumption is self-explanatory. Researchers examine the effect of imputation in the dependent variable only. If all observations had missing values, there would be no donors from which to draw. The imputation effects are similar to measurement error.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~"…ASSUMPTION 2: assumption 2 is crucial. In assumption 2 and elsewhere, the E(O) notation reads as the population expectation of earnings when earnings is observed while E(M) is the population expectation of earnings for the missing, those who do not report earnings and have earnings imputed. This assumption states that there is no selection on the earnings variable with respect to unobservables (factors not included in z(i). Assumption 2 assumes conditional missing at random, albeit in a ""weak"" form, such that there is no difference in mean earnings between the observed and missing, conditional on z(i). Assumption 2 allows the distribution of (x(i),z(i)) to differe between those who report earnings and those who do not. Researchers call this a ""weak"" form of ""missing at random"" (MAR) because it only requires the mean but not the distribution of earnings within a match cell to be equivalent for those who report and do not report earnings. Researchers refer to this as ""conditional mean missing at random,"" or CMMAR."
187~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Observed Earnings Expectation~…the population expectation of earnings when earnings is observed.
187~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Imputed Earnings Expectation~…the population expectation of earnings for the missing, those who do not report earnings and have earnings imputed.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…ASSUMPTION 3: assumption 3 is innocuous, simply stating that knowing z(i) gives perfect information about the value of x(i). That is, if you know the value of a variable at its detailed level, you know its value at an aggregate level. The opposite may not be true. An important implication for this is that the expected value of x(i) with respect to z(i) is equal to x(i), while the expected value of z(i) with respect to x(i) is not specified generally.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…ASSUMPTION 4: assumption 4 implies that the relationship between earnings and z(i) is linear in the parameters and that x(i) do not contain information about earnings beyond what is contained in the more detailed variables z(i). When z(i) is categorical to begin with, this is always true, while when z(i) is an ordinal variable, it implies that the specification is linear and there are no further nonlinearities that are better captured by the collapsed categories. Note that nonlinearities are allowed; the vector z(i) must simply contain appropriate variables such as quadratic terms. Essentially, the assumption implies that the researcher has the correct specification for the unconditional expectation function of earnings relative to z(i).
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…ASSUMPTION 5: finally, assumption 5 implies that, conditional upon x(i), the distribution of the imputed earnings is independent of the distribution of z(i). That is, the imputed data conditional on x(i) are independent of the variables not included as imputation match criteria.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…researchers consider the population least squares projection of earnings on z(i) when imputed values are used for those who do not report earnings. Under general assumptions, OLS is consistent for the least squares projection.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…although CMMAR is assumed for the general case and for all empirical work, researchers subsequently impose MAR in some of the illustrative theory sections in order to simplify results.
187~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~z(i)~…denotes a vector of the regressors of interest.
187~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~x(i)~…denotes a vector of the categories upon which matches are made.
187~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Probability of Nonobservation~…the parameter p is the probability of not observing earnings (estimated by the proportion of missing values in the sample).
187~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Observed Earnings Expectation~…the expectation of the regressors of interest given the categories upon which matches are made for the population who report earnings.
187~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Imputed Earnings Expectation~…the expectation of the regressors of interest given the categories upon which matches are made for the population who do not report earnings.
187~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Overall Expecations~…terms with no subscripts are expectations for the full population, including both respondents and nonrespondents.
187~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~…this term is the covariance between regressors z(i) and the prediction error from the relationship between those regressors and the match variables. Hence, the entire term can be thought of in the following way. First, regress z(i) on the match variable and take the residuals. Then regress those residuals back on z(i). This measures the variation in z(i) that is not accounted for by the match variables. In essence, this is measuring the omitted information from the imputation procedure and it behaves like an omitted variable bias term. This can also be viewed as measurement error.
187~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~…the donor's earnings were generated from a particular value of z, which does not necessarily match the value of z(i) of the recipient. The measurement error measures the difference between the recipient's z(i) (i.e. the mismeasured variable) and the average donor's z(i) for donors in the cell. The bias term is similar to the usual attenuation term found with measurement error.
187~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Match Bias~…if z(i) equals x(i), implying that all variables in the model are included as imputation characteristics and at the same level of detail, then no match bias exists.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…all terms in the equation for the slope coefficients are estimable in sample. There are six steps used to estimate the bias and correct the full sample estimates for impuation bias.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…STEP 1: Use OLS to estimate the slopes on the full sample (including imputations). Retain the inverse of the variance of z(i).
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…STEP 2: Using R(i) = O (observed) subsample, estimate the observed earnings expectation. As a practical matter, in the CPS, this can be done using OLS on a full set of interaction terms for the imputation categories: age, education, gender, race, and so forth. Alternatively, this can be done by constructing all imputation cells and averaging within cell.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…STEP 3: Predict z(i) using the estimated observed earnings expectation for all observations in the sample (using the appropriate match categories for each observation).
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…STEP 4: Construct the measurement error in the sample and average over that sample.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…STEP 5: Parameter p is estimated by the missing rate in the sample.
187~D1~DV7~Methodology~Probability of Nonobservation~…parameter p is estimated by the missing rate in the log-linear regression sample.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…STEP 6: Use estimated terms to construct estimates of the coefficients.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…since the imputed observations are not independent of the nonimputed observations, the usual standard errors are not appropriate. Indeed, if the regression is earnings on match categories, if all imputations are drawn from the observed sample, the standard errors reduce to the standard errors from only the observed sample.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the CPS hot deck procedure, many imputations derive from observations from previous months, some of which may not be included in the estimation sample. If the sample is selected on some z(i) criteria (including time period), some imputations will be drawn from outside the criteria. In cases where the regression includes variables other than matching categories as in the case studied here, there is some informational gain to including imputations.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…in the CPS hot deck procedure, many imputations derive from observations from previous months, some of which may not be included in the estimation sample. If the sample is selected on some z(i) criteria (including time period), some imputations will be drawn from outside the criteria. In cases where the regression includes variables other than matching categories as in the case studied here, there is some informational gain to including imputations.
187~D1~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…although one approach to estimating standard errors in the case of this model would be to use a bootstrap, researchers use estimates based upon standard asymptotic results. Heteroskedastic robust standard errors for the OLS estimates are produced with typical software. To arrive at standard errors for the bias-corrected results, researchers assume nonstochastic regressors. The variance covariance matrix for the bias-corrected slopes is simply contingent on the bias correction matrix. This may tend to slightly undestate the variance since it ignores variation of the bias correction matrix. Researchers choose to ignore the issue of sampling variation due to the imputations.
187~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Bias Correction Matrix~…the bias correction matrix is used in computing the bias-corrected slopes in determing standard errors and variances in log-linear regressions.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~...researchers compare alternative methods to correct match bias, providing evidence on wage gap estimates with respect to selected attributes that are not match criteria.
187~D1~V11~Variable~Union Status~…wage gap estimates are made with respect to a binary indicator variable for union status.
187~D1~V11~Variable~Marital Status~…wage gap estimates are made with respect to an indicator variable for marital status.

187~D1~V12~Variable~Employment Sectors~…wage gap estimates are made with respect to employment sectors.
187~V12~L50~Variable Value~Industry~…one of three employment sector categories available in the CPS.
187~V12~L51~Variable Value~Public Sector~…one of three employment sector categories available in the CPS.
187~V12~L52~Variable Value~Nonprofit Status~…one of three employment sector categories available in the CPS.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample in estimating the wage gap with respect to selected attributes that are not match criteria is drawn from the CPS-ORG for the period 1998 to 2002. The estimation sample includes all nonstudent wage and salary employees age 18 and over. Estimates are provided separately by gender, the sample of men being 388,578 and that of women being 369,762. In the male sample, 28.7% have earnings imputed, as compared to 26.8% of the female sample.
187~D1~T2~Time Period~1998-2002~…the sample in estimating the wage gap with respect to selected attributes that are not match criteria is drawn from the CPS-ORG for the period 1998 to 2002.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample period provides a convenient time period. Beginning in 1998, added information on education, including the GED was inclued. Beginning in 2003, new occupation codes (from the 2000 census) led to a change in the imputation match categories.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…provides coefficient estimates obtained from a standard log wage equation estimated using alternative approaches.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…included in the equations are potential experience in quartic form and dummy variables for education, marital status, race/ethnicity, foreign born, union, metropolitan size, region, occupation, employment sector, and year. The dependent variable is the natural log of average hourly earnings, including tips, comissions and overtime, calculated as usual weekly earnings dived by usual weekly hours worked.
187~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…included in log wage regressions is potential experience in quartic form (defined as the minimum of age minus years schooling minus 6 or years since age 16).
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…included in log wage regressions are 23 dummy variables for education.
187~D1~V11~Variable~Marital Status~…included in log wage regressions are 2 dummy variables for marital status.
187~D1~V5~Variable~Race/Ethnicity~…included in log wage regressions are 4 dummy variables for race/ethnicity.
187~D1~V13~Variable~Foreign Born~…included in log wage regressions is a dummy variable specifying for whether or not an individual was foreign born.
187~D1~V11~Variable~Union Status~…included in log wage regressions is a dummy variable specifying for whether or not an individual is a member of a union.
187~D1~V3~Variable~Metropolitan Size~…included in log wage regressions are 6 dummy variables for metropolitan size.
187~D1~V16~Variable~Region~…included in log wage regressions are 8 dummy variables for region.
187~D1~V6~Variable~Occupation (1979-2002)~…included in log wage regressions are 12 dummy variables for occupation.
187~D1~V7~Variable~Occupation (2003-present)~…included in log wage regressions are 12 dummy variables for occupation.
187~D1~V12~Variable~Employment Sectors~…included in log wage regressions are 17 dummy variables for employment sector.
187~D1~V17~Variable~Year~…included in log wage regressions are 4 dummy variables for year.
187~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Average Hourly Earnings~…the dependent variable in log wage regressions is the natural log of average hourly earnings, including tips, commissions, and overtime, calculated as usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours worked.
187~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Average Hourly Earnings~…in computing average hourly earnings, top-coded weekly earnings are assiged the estimated mean above the cap ($2,885) based on an assumed Pareto distribution above the median (estimates are gender and year specific and roughly 1.5 times the cap, with small increases by year and higher means for men than for women.
187~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Wage Gap~"…wage gap estimates are drawn from regressions based on the full sample with Census imputations (the standard approach among researchers), the imputed (""missing"") sample, the respondent (""observed"") sample, the observed sample uisng inverse probability weighting (IPW) to correct for changes in the sample composition, and the full sample using the general bias correciton."
187~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Inverse Probability Weighting~…the IPW estimates require a brief explanation. Although researchers have assumed no specification error, in practice, coefficients may differ across workers with different characteristics. If individuals are missing at random, the composition of the observed and full samples will be the same. If nonresponse is not random, estimates can differ. To account for the change in sample composition correlated with observables, researchers first run a probit equation with response as the binary dependent variable and all z(i) as regressors. Researchers then weight the observed sample by the inverse of the probability of response, thus giving enhanced weights to those most likely to be underrepresented in the observed sample. Reweighting does not correct for possible selection on unobservables.
187~D1~M3~Methodology~Probit~…in computing IPWs, to account for the change in sample composition correlated with observables, researchers first run a probit equation with response as the binary dependent variable and all z(i) as regressors.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the log-wage regression sample includes all nonstudent wage and salary workers age 18 and over, from the January 1998 to December 2002 monthly CPS-ORG eranings files.
187~D1~F1~Findings~Union-Nonunion Log Wage Gap for Males Across Samples~"…focusing on the male sample, the union-nonunion log wage gap is estimated to be .191 among respondents, only .024 among imputed earners, and .142 in the combined sample, a 25% attenuation as seen in the ""Ratio (1)/(3)"" column."
187~V11~L53~Variable Value~Married~"…a ""married"" coefficient in log wage regressions measures the wage gap between married males with spouse present and never-married males."
187~D1~F2~Findings~Marriage Wage Premium for the Full CPS Sample~…the full CPS sample produces an uncorrected marriage premium estimate of .096, while exclusion of imputed earners increases the estimate to .127, implying attenuation of 24%.
187~D1~F3~Findings~Foreign Born and Minority-Specific Wage Disadvantages~…the wage disadvantage for foreign-born workers is an estimated -.130 in the respondent sample but only -.099 in the full sample. Hispanic workers have an estimated -.123 wage disadvantage using the respondent sample, compared to -0.99 in the full sample.
187~D1~F4~Findings~Wage Gaps for Asian Workers~…wage gap estimates for Asian workers (compared to non-Hispanic whites) are small but display large attenuation (26%).
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…regressions provide wage dispersion estimates among 18 sectors, 13 private for-profit industry groups, 4 public sector groups, and the private nonprofit sector.
187~V12~L50~Variable Value~Industry~…consists of 13 private for-profit industry groups.
187~V12~L51~Variable Value~Public Sector~…consists of 4 public sector groups including federal nonpostal, postal, state, and local.
187~D1~F5~Findings~Mean Absolute Log Deviation Across Employment Sectors~…the mean absolute log deviation across the 18 employment sectors is an estimated .117 based on the respondent sample, but it falls to .090 using the full sample. One observes similar attenuation among wage differences for region and city size, standard control variables in most earnings equations.
187~D1~F6~Findings~Union Wage Gap in the Corrected Samples for Men and Women~…focusing on the union wage gap, researchers obtain a corrected full-sample union gap for men of .199, compared to a .191 based on the unweighted respondent sample; corresponding estimates for women are .148 and .143 respectively.
187~D1~F7~Findings~Union Wage Gap with IPW for Men and Women~…IPW results produce a union gap estimate of .193 among men, higher than those obtained from the unweighted respondent sample but less than from the corrected full sample. The IPW union gap estimate is .143 among women, the same as the unweighted respondent estimate.
187~D1~F8~Findings~Wald Statistics for Men Across Samples~…for males, researchers obtain Wald statistics (ordered from high to low) of 991.2 for uncorrected full versus corrected full, 285.3 for uncorrected full versus unweighted respondent, 101.7 for uncorrected full versus weighted respondent, 39.5 for unweighted respondent versus weighted respondent, 13.5 for unweighted respondent versus corrected full, and 7.0 for weighted respondent versus corrected full. Although all differences are significant (the critical value is 1.3), that found between the corrected full sample and weighted respondent sample is relatively small.
187~D1~F9~Findings~Null Rejection Across Log-Wage Coefficients by Gender~"…based on the log-wage regressions, researchers reject the null for ""only"" two of five coefficients among men and three of five among women."
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…although an important contribution of this article is the derivation and use of the full-sample bias correction approach, it faces limitations for more general use. First, it is not trivial to understand and program, making it an unattractive approach in some cases. Second, the bias correction derived here is designed specifically for the cell hot deck imputation used in CPS-ORG, although the setup and its application can be used more broadly. 
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the bias correction derived in this article can be applied to either the CPS-ORG cell hot deck or to the March CPS Annual Demographic File (ADF) sequential hot deck. Its assumptions, however, are more severely violated in the ADF.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the March CPS bias correction assumes that the draw for the imputation is from the same distribution as the rest of the sample. The imputation draws from the conditonal distribution including the specific match charactersitics. With dated donors from prior months, this is not literally true in the ORGs. With the March ADF, the assumption is violated when researchers drawn from the expected value of earnings relative to match characteristics, the second or subsequent step matching only on some characteristics. 
187~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Earnings~…researchers conduct a regression-based imputation for nonrespondents using the predicted value from the observed sample parameters, plus an error term.
187~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Earnings~…this measure fails to account for composition bias owing to the use of the observed-only parameters and the absence of the detailed interactions implicit in a cell hot deck procedure.
187~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~z(i)~…in later specifications of the model, this vector is assumed to be a vector of k - 1 binary variables representing k mutually exclusive categories.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…beginning in 1992, the CPS substituted an educational degree question for their previous measure of completed years of schooling. In 1998, additional questions were added to the CPS on receipt of a GED and years spent in school for both nondegree and degree students.
187~D1~T3~Time Period~1992-2002~…beginning in 1992, the CPS substituted an educational degree question for their previous measure of completed years of schooling.
187~D1~T4~Time Period~1998-2002~…in 1998, additional questions were added to the CPS on receipt of a GED and years spent in school for both nondegree and degree students.
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…beginning in 1992, the CPS substituted an educational degree question for their previous measure of completed years of schooling. In 1998, additional questions were added to the CPS on receipt of a GED and years spent in school for both nondegree and degree students. Based on this information, one can construct detailed schooling degree/years variables that include well over 25 categories. One can also distinguish between years of schooling and highest degree.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the ORG hot-deck imputation used since 1979 includes schooling as a match criterion, but it matches the earnings of donors to nonrespondents based on three broad categories of education.
187~V2~L1~Variable Value~Low~…one of three broad categories of education specifying for those individuals with less than a high school degree.
187~V2~L2~Variable Value~Middle~…one of three broad categories of education specifying for those with a high school degree, including a GED, through some college.
187~V2~L3~Variable Value~High~…one of three broad categories of education specifying for those with a BA degree or above.
187~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Earnings~…were schooling the only match criterion, the expected value of donor earnings matched to nonrespondents would be the average earnings among respondents within each broad schooling category. Donor earnings would increase across the three schooling groups but not within. Because other match criteria, in particular broad occupation, are correlated with schooling and earnings, imputed earnings may increase modestly within schooling groups. The schooling match creates an interesting form of match bias, flattening estimated earnings-schooling profiles within the low, middle, and high education groups and creating large jumps across groups.
187~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Schooling Returns~…provides separate estimates of schooling returns for respondents and imputed earnings. Estimates are from male and female wage equations, using the 1998-2002 CPS samples seen in the prior section.
187~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Schooling Returns~…shows log wage differentials for each schooling group relative to earnings respondents with no zero schooling.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in computing schooling returns from a pooled wage equation of respondents and imputed earners, the male sample size from the 1998-2002 CPS is 388,578-276,909 respondents and 111,669 with earnings allocated (imputed) by the Census. The female sample size is 369,762-270,537 respondents and 99,225 with earnings allocated (imputed) by the Census. The sample includes all nonstudent wage and salary workers, ages 18 and over.
187~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Schooling Returns~…in computing schooling returns from a pooled wage equation of respondents and imputed earners, the male sample size from the 1998-2002 CPS is 388,578-276,909 respondents and 111,669 with earnings allocated (imputed) by the Census. The female sample size is 369,762-270,537 respondents and 99,225 with earnings allocated (imputed) by the Census. The sample includes all nonstudent wage and salary workers, ages 18 and over.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…in computing schooling returns from a pooled wage equation of respondents and imputed earners, in addition to education variables, control variables include potential experience in quartic form, race-ethnicity, foreign born, marital status, part time, labor market size, region, and year.
187~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…defined as the minimum of age minus years schooling minus 6 or years since age 16.
187~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…reported in a quartic form in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V5~Variable~Race/Ethnicity~…four dummy variables for five categories as included in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V13~Variable~Foreign Born~…an indicator variable for foreign born status as included in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V11~Variable~Marital Status~…a series of 2 indicator variables for marital status as included in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V18~Variable~Part-Time~…an indicator variable for part-time status as included in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V19~Variable~Labor Market Size~…a series of 6 indicator variables for the size of the labor market as included in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V16~Variable~Region~…a series of 8 indicator variables for region as included in computing returns to schooling.
187~D1~V17~Variable~Year~…a series of 4 year variables included in computing returns to schooling.
187~V2~L54~Variable Value~GED~…here, upward match bias is severe, because the GED is the lowest education level within the middle education match category.
187~D1~F10~Findings~GED-Holder Wage Differentials Across Samples~…based on the sample of earnings respondents, the earnings gain for a male GED recipient relative to men who stop at 12 years of high school without a degree is a modest .036. The same differential for imputed earners is an incredible .241 log points. A standard wage equation using an uncorrected full sample would find a misleadingly large .087 wage gain for the GED more than double the .036 estimate found for respondents. The standard biased estimate indicates a .042 GED wage disadvantage, substantially smaller than the .072 GED disadvantage found among those with observed earnings.
187~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Schooling Returns~…researchers do not interpret schooling parameters, even those corrected for match bias, as casual effects. Among other things, the estimates of schooling returns do not account for ability bias or reporting error in education.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the CPS provides information on years of schooling completed prior to receipt of the GED. This information is used in researchers' analysis of ""sheepskin"" effects."
187~D1~F11~Findings~Graduate Degree Wage Differentials Across Samples~…estimates from the respondent sample reveal a large .355 log point wage advantage among men with professional degrees as compared to men with BA degrees. Based on a standard full sample without correction, the wage advantage is .241, attenuation being 32%. The bias is similarly large for women, with a professional/BA degree wage advantage of .444 log points among earnings respondents versus .296 using the full sample, attenuation of 33%. A similar pattern of bias is readily evident for those with PhD degrees.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…the R-squared is the squared correlation between z(i) and x(i). The slope coefficient is attenuated by the proportion p imputed, mitigated in part by correlation between the information in match variables x(i) and the nonmatch elements of z(i).
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the CPS, nonrespondents are matched to the earnings of donors in six age categories.
187~D1~V1~Variable~Age~…in the CPS, nonrespondents are matched to the earnings of donors in six age categories.
187~D1~F12~Findings~Annual Wage Growth by Age Group Transition for Men~…focusing on men, annual wage growth among respondents is .041 for ages 18 to 24 and .028 for ages 25 to 34. Wage growth seen among those with imputed earnings is far lower, .006 for ages 18 to 24 and .004 for ages 25 to 34. Wage growth is low in the 35 to 54 age interval, .005 in the respondent sample versus close to zero in the imputed sample.
187~D1~F13~Findings~Annual Wage Growth by Age Group Transition for Women~…whereas female respondents display annual wage growth of .029 for ages 18 to 24 and .020 for ages 25 to 34, growth using the imputed sample is effectively zero.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~"…a simple way to illustrate the bias of age is to estimate linear wage-age profiles within each of the age categories using the respondent and imputed sample. Researchers use a specification with largely ""premarket"" demographic and schooling variables, plus location and year controls. The sample is all nonstudent wage and salary workers, ages 18 and over, from the CPS-ORG, 1998-2002. Control variables include a full set of education dummies, demographic variables, region, city size, and year. Specifications including age variables do not include potential experience."
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…a more general way to illustrate the age-based bias is to include a full set of age dummies and to estimate wage-age profiles for respondents and nonrespondents. In addition to the education dummies, control variables include race-ethnicity, foreign born, labor market size, region, and year.
187~D1~F14~Findings~Age-Related Earnings Bias for Imputed vs. Observed Earners~…in examining the age-based bias of earnings, imputed earners exhibit substantial flattening of wage-age profiles within each category, the bias being most serious for ages 18 to 24 and 25 to 34 when wage growth is highest. In the imputed worker sample, large wage jumps are observed between ages 24 and 25, between ages 34 and 35 and, going in the opposite direction, between ages 64 and 65. There is no jump between ages 54 and 55, since the weighted means of assigned donor earnings are similar in the adjacent age intervals.
187~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Age Returns~…shown are log wage differentials at each age relative to earnings of respondents who are age 18.
187~D1~F15~Findings~Male Wage Equation Quadratic Log Wage Profiles Across Observed and Imputed Samples~…in a male wage equation, respondents have a quadratic log wage profile of .039 and -0.68. Estimates for the imputed sample produce a flatter profile, .035 and -.057. Estimating the profile using the full sample without correction, coefficient estimates are .038 and -.065, a profile slightly flatter than the one observed for respondents. Uncorrected standard errors are much higher when imputed earners are included. An identical qualitative pattern is seen for women.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…to rescale coefficients, experience squared is divided by 100.
187~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Experience Squared~…to rescale coefficients, experience squared is divided by 100.
187~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Sheepskin Effects~…result in jump discontinuities in the earnings-education profile.
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…the schooling coefficient in log wage equations represents the percentage (log) wage gain associated with an additional year of schooling.
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…in the extreme (and ignoring complicating factors), if education is exclusively human capital enhancement, then the coefficients on the degree completion indicators should approach zero and years of schooling should measure the full human capital effect. If education provides only a signaling mechanism, then the coefficient on years schooling should approach zero and only the degree effects should matter.
187~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…the model is estimated with mixed education variables. The sample is restricted to the range of data over which researchers can clearly distinguish between years of schooling and degree. Researchers omit the relatively few workers with less than 9 years of schooling or with professional and PhD degress for whom separate information on years schooling is not provided. Control variables include a full set of demographic variables, region, city size, and year. The full sample includes both the respondent (observed and imputed (missing) samples with Census imputation. Corrected estimates are based on the full sample and the general bias correction. The IP-weighted estimates report least squares estimates from the respondent sample reweighted by the inverse probability that an individual's earnings are reported.
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~"…""school"" is the measure of years of schooling completed."
187~D1~F16~Findings~Returns to Schooling Across Samples for Men~…the full sample estimate for men suggests a rate of return of .036 (in log points) for a year of schooling, holding degree constant. The estimate on the observed sample is .042 absent weights and .043 reweighted to adjust for a changed sample composition. The corrected full sample estimate is .046, a percentage point larger than the uncorrected estimate.
187~D1~F17~Findings~Degree Indicator Estimation Results for Men~…the coefficient on high school degree in the full sample is .136. The estimates from the observed sample, the IPW observed sample, and the corrected full sample are much smaller at .097, .094, and .092, respectively. Similarly, the estimated effect of a GED (years constant) is overstated due to match bias. The full sample estimate places the value of a GED at .119, while the observed, IPW observed, and full corrected sample estimates are only .067, .067, and .068, respectively.
187~V2~L55~Variable Value~MA~…MA recipients designate their program as a 1, 2, or 3+ year program
187~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…information on additional years schooling is provided for those with some college and no degree and for BA degree recipients with graduate course work but no degree.
187~V2~L56~Variable Value~High School Diploma~…those with some college but no postsecondary degree are coded as having received a regular high school diploma.
187~V2~L54~Variable Value~GED~…information on the GED is provided only for those without education beyond high school.
187~D1~F18~Findings~Returns to Schooling Across Samples for Women~…when looking at the degree returns for women, the full sample return estimate of .048 is less than estimates from the observed sample of .054, the reweighted observed sample of .056, and the corrected full sample of .062. The GED full sample estimate of .129 compares to estimates of .091, .093, and .082 from the unweighted observed, IPW observed, and corrected full samples. Estimates of the value of a high school degree are very similar to those for men.
187~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Earnings~…earnings nonrespondents are assigned the nominal earnings of the donor who is the most recent respondent with an identical mix of match attributes.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…earnings nonrespondents are assigned the nominal earnings of the donor who is the most recent respondent with an identical mix of match attributes.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…during the 1994-2002 period, the Census match procedure included 14,976 cells or combinations of match characteristics. 
187~D1~T5~Time Period~1994-2002~…during the 1994-2002 period, the Census match procedure included 14,976 cells or combinations of match characteristics. 
187~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Earnings~…for match cells with a relatively uncommon mix, donor earnings may be relatively dated, biasing downward imputed earnings owing to nominal and real wage growth. Stated alternatively, the survey month can be considered a wage determinant.
187~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Datedness of Donor Earnings~…to assess the seriousness of dated donor problems, one must approximate Census hot deck methods and measure the datedness of donor earnings. The analysis begins with all employed wage and salary workers, ages 18 and over, from the December 2002 CPS. Researchers first examine whether at least one donor match exists for each nonrespondent in December 2002. Those not finding a donor are retained, and a search for a donor in November 2002 is executed. This process continues back to January 1998. in order to increase the size and representativeness of the nonrespondent sample, researchers conduct the identical analysis for nonrespondents during from January to Novembrer 2002. 
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to assess the seriousness of dated donor problems, one must approximate Census hot deck methods and measure the datedness of donor earnings. The analysis begins with all employed wage and salary workers, ages 18 and over, from the December 2002 CPS. This month's file contains 4,759 nonrespondents. Some of these individuals will be matched to donor earnings in the current month, while most will reach back to donors in previous months and years. Each nonrespondent in December 2002 is given a unique match number corresponding to the 14,976 possible combinations of match attributes. Likewise, potential donors (respondents) in 60 monthly CPS earnings files (December 2002 back to January 1998) are assigned attribute match numbers on the same basis. 
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the total number of nonrespondents during 2002 is 55,902.
187~D1~F19~Findings~Datedness of Donor Earnings Estimation Results~…in the initial month, i.e. December 2002, just 17.3% of 2002 nonrespondents find a same-month donor. Reaching back 1 month, an additional 16.8% are matched, followed by 11.5% and 8.3% reaching back 2 and 3 months.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…within the first 4 retroactive survey months (the sample month plus 3 months back), over half (53.9%) of all nonrespondents are assigned donor earnings. Those not finding matches have decreasing match hazards in subsequent months.
187~D1~F20~Findings~Proportion of Nonrespondents After 5 Years~…even after 5 years, reaching back 59 months from month zero to January 1998, 2.85% of nonrespondents remain without earnings assignment and are assigned donor earnings in excess of 5 years old.
187~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Datedness of Donor Earnings~…researchers add the residual monthly match rate of 2.85% to the prior month labeled 60 plus.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…beginning in 2003, the number of occupation categories in the Census match algorithm was reduced from 13 to 10, reducing the number of hot deck cells from 14,976 to 11,520.
187~D1~T6~Time Period~2003-2004~…beginning in 2003, the number of occupation categories in the Census match algorithm was reduced from 13 to 10, reducing the number of hot deck cells from 14,976 to 11,520.
187~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Datedness of Donor Earnings~…beginning in 2003, the number of occupation categories in the Census match algorithm was reduced from 13 to 10, reducing the number of hot deck cells from 14,976 to 11,520. In order to see how this affects donor datedness, researchers provide an analysis matching the 17,864 earnigs nonrespondents in the January to April 2004 period to donors beginning in April 2004 and reaching back to January 2003.
187~D1~F21~Findings~Donor Find Rate and Datedness of Donor Earnings Appreciation~…whereas 53.9% of the 2002 nonrespondents found donors during the current or 3 previous months, the corresponding number for the January-April 2004 nonrespondents is 53.1%. Reaching back 15 months, 84.0% of the 2002 nonrespondents found a match; the corresponding number for 2004 respondents is 83.4%. These findings lead to the conclusion that donor datedness has not appreciably changed as a result of the revised occupational match categories beginning in 2003.
187~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Datedness of Donor Earnings~…for ease of programming, nonrespondents during each month of 2002 are treated as if they were December nonrespondents. That is, for each 2002 nonrespondent, researchers first search for matching donors in December 2002, and then they reach back in time as far as January 1998.
187~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to approximate the Census match rate in the initial month, the donor pool is constructed by taking a 50% random sample of December 2002 respondents. The Census searches for donors amonth those who are listed in the file layout prior to the nonrespondent. Thus nonrespondents at the beginning of the December 2002 file are assigned donors from November 2002 or earlier, whereas nonrespondents at the end of the file can be matched to the full month donor sample. Researchers approximate this by using a half donor sample in the initial month (and full samples thereafter).
187~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Mean Donor Age~…to calculate mean donor age one must assume an average match date for the nonrespondents who have failed to find a match in the previous 5 years.
187~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Mean Donor Age~…for the 2002 sample of nonrespondents, researchers assume that the 2.85% not matched going back to January 1998 would on average find a match in 6 additional months.
187~D1~F22~Findings~Average Datedness of Donor Earnings~…under the assumption that the 2.85% not matched going back to January 1998 would on average find a match in 6 additional months, the average age or datedness of all donor earnings is 8.6 months, or nearly three-quarters of a year, substantially larger than the median age of 3 months (the current month and 3 months back). If nominal wage growth were, say, 3% annually, this would imply that the average earnings of donors are understated by 2.25%. The estimate of an 8.6 month mean donor age is sensitive to the assumed average match date for those relatively few nonrespondents unmatched.
187~D1~F23~Findings~CPS Average Earnings Due to Understatement~…with approximately 30% of the CPS sample being nonrespondents, the CPS understates average earnings by .675% (three-quarters of a year times 3% annual wage growth times .30 proportion donors), or two-thirds of a percentage point. In 2004, average hourly earnings compiled from the CPS, including imputed earnings, is $17.69, 2.85% higher than the 2003 average of $17.20. Multiplying by .0064 (.75 times 2.85% times .30), earnings are understated by $.11, with the true average wage closer to $17.80.
187~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Inverse Probability Weighting~…the inverse probability weighting method has the added advantage of greater generality, being appropriate with surveys whose imputation methods differ substantively from the Census cell hot deck.
188~188: Match Bias in Wage Gap Estimates Due to Earnings Imputation~~~~
188~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…wage gap estimates are biased toward zero when the attribute being studied (e.g., union status) is not a criterion used to match donors to nonrespondents.
188~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Match Bias~"…an expression for ""match bias"" is derived in which attenuation equals the sum of match error rates."
188~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Proportion of Imputed Earnings~…attenuation can be approximated by the proportion with imputed earnings.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey (CPS) provides the principal data source for estimates of union-nonunion wage premiums and sectoral wage differentials.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…as widely recognized, many individuals surveyed in the CPS (and other household surveys) either refuse to report their earnings or ""proxy"" respondents in their household are unable to report earnings. Rather than compile official statistics based on large numbers of incomplete records, the census allocates or imputes earnings for those with missing values."
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…during the 1980s, fewer than 15% of workers in the CPS had earnings imputed. This figure rose with the 1994 change in CPS earnings questions, and it has continued to increase in recent years. In 2001, 31% of all private and public sector wage and salary employees in the CPS earnings files had weekly earnings imputed by the census.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the U.S. Census allocates earnings using a ""hot deck"" imputation method that matches each nonrespondent to an individual or ""donor"" whose characteristics are identical. The donor's reported earnings are then assigned to the nonrespondent. Among the more important characteristics used in matching a donor to a nonrespondent are gender, age, education and hours worked, four strong correlates of earnings. Two characteristics not used are union status and sector (e.g., industry) of employment."

188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…failure to account for earnings imputation causes a substantial under-statement in the union wage gap.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…changes over time in how allocated earners are designated in the CPS have led passed researchers  to report misleading changes in union wage gaps.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the March CPS Annual Demographic Files allocates missing earnings using a unique ""hot deck"" imputation method. Using this method, matching of a nonrespondent with a donor is done in steps, with each step involving a less detailed match requirement. For example, suppose that there were just four matching variables - sex, age, education, and occupation. The matching program would first attempt to find an exact match on the combination of variables where each is segmented at a relatively detailed level. When there is not a successful match at a given level, matching proceeds to the next step, where a less detailed breakdown is used, say, broader occupations and age categories. The probability of a close match declines the less comon are an individual's characteristics."

188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS-ORG files are made up of the quarter sample of individuals in the monthly survey who are asked, among other things, usual weekly earnings, hours worked, and union status.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the CPS-ORG files use an imputation procedure called the ""cell hot deck"" method, which differs from the method used in the March CPS. The census creates cells based on the following seven categories: gender (2 cells), age (6), race (2), education (3), occupation (13), hours worked (8), and receipt of tips, commisions, or overtime (2), a matrix of 14,976 possible combinations. The census keeps all cells ""stocked"" with a donor insuring that an exact match is always found. The donor in each cell is the most recent person surveyed by the census with reported earnings and all the characteristics. When a new person with those characteristics is surveyd and reports earnings, the census replaces the previous occupation of the cell. To insure an occupant of each cell, the census reaches back as far as necessary within a given survey month and then to previous months and years. When surveyed individuals do not report earnings, their earnings are imputed by assigning the value of (nominal) earnings reported by the current donor occupying the cell with an exact match of characteristics."

188~D1~V10~Variable~Location~…location is not an explicit match criterion using the cell hot deck, but files are sorted by location and nonrespondents are matched to the most recent donor match (i.e., the geographically closest person moving backward in the file). If matched to someone in a similarly priced neighborhood, the donor is more likely to have earnings similar to the nonrespondent than if the match is based exclusively on the mix of attributes defining each cell.

If matched to someone in a similarly priced neighborhood, the donor is more likely to have earnings similar to the nonrespondent than if the match is based exclusively on the mix of attributes defining each cell.
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…downward bias in wage gap estimates is mitigated as the difference between reported and imputed wages shrink. Mitigation of bias from the location effect is likely to be very small, except for nonrespondents in highly populated cells.
188~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Earnings~"…an imputation procedure is regarded as ""proper"" if it restores fully the sampling variability. Single impuation procedures are ""not proper"" because they do not incorporate information about the uncertainty associated with the choice of the value to impute. Multiple imputation methods select multiple donors for each missing observation (or, stated alternatively, create multiple data sets) and permit the researcher to account for the variability associated with the assignement of an imputed value."
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…the census hot deck procedures assume either no response bias or ""ignorable response bias"" whereby the match criteria capture differences in earnings.

188~DV2~L2~Variable Value~Ignorable Response Bias~…the likelihood of nonresponse might vary with schooling, occupation, and other match attributes, but as long as the earnings of respondents and nonrespondents within cells are equivalent, there is no response bias resulting from the imputation procedure and, therefore, the bias that does exist is ignorable.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…although the ""cell hot deck"" procedure has been used for the CPS-ORG files since their beginning in 1979, the selection categories have not been identical over time.

188~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Match Bias~…to understand more fully the nature of match bias, researchers offer a simple example. Once again, assume equivalent rates of nonresponse and donor mix for union and nonunion respondents so that the bias formula applies. Assume that 10% of private sector workers are union members, and that 25% of workers in the CPS have earnings allocated, with union status not a match criterion. In selecting donors for those with missing earnings, let 10% of union nonrespondents be matched to union donors and 90% of nonunion donors. Likewise, among nonunion workers with missing earnings, let 90% be matched to nonunion donors and 10% to union donors. Union workers with imputed earnings have their earnings understated by .18 (.90 times the .20 union wage differential) so that the average of union earnings for those with and without imputed earnings is understated by .045 (.25 imputed earners times .18). Turning to nonunion workers with iputed earnings, their earnings are overstated by .02 (.10 times the .20 union differential) and so the average of nonunion earnings is overstated by .005 (.25 imputed earners times .02). Taken together, the measured union-nonunion wage differential is .15 rather than .20, biased downward by .05 due to the understatement of union earnings (.045) and overstatement of nonunion earnings (.005). Stated alternatively, with bias equal to .05, attenuation is equal to .25 and the attenuation is .75. For the 25% of the sample with earnings imputed, there exists no union wage gap.
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…the unbiased union-nonunion log wage gap.
188~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Biased Union Wage Gap~…the biased wage gap is equal to the attenuation coefficient multiplied by the unbiased union wage gap.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…bias is exacerbated in a wage regression framework if union status is correlated with other covariates.
188~D1~F1~Findings~Imputation Rate, Donor Mix, Unbiased Wage Gap and Downward Bias/Attenuation Coefficient~…imputation rates of .25 for union and nonunion workers, an equal donor mix of 10% for union, and an unbiased wage gap of .20 lead to downward bias of .05 log points and an attenuation coefficient of .75.
188~D1~F2~Findings~Donor Match Mix and Earnings Bias~…if union workers are matched to donors of whom 18% are union and if nonunion workers are matched to 9% union workers, bias falls from .05 to 0.046. Were union workers matched to 50% union donors and nonunion workers to 3% union donors (with imputation rates of .26 and .24), bias would decline to .027.
188~D1~T1~Time Period~1996-2001~…relevant period from which data is drawn from the Current Population Survey.
188~D1~F3~Findings~Actual Imputation vs. Predicted Imputation, and Donor Match Rates~…the actual impuation rates in the 1996-2001 CPS sample are .265 for union members and .257 for nonunion members, while the donor mixes obtained by the researchers' own hot deck procedure are .180 for union donors attributed to union nonrespondents and .091 for union donors attributed to nonunion nonrespondents. Predicted match bias is .048, and the attenuation coefficient is .759, which is close to the values from the simple approximation.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in a wage regression including union status plus correlated covariates, identifying match bias is not straightfoward. Recasting match bias as a form of misclassification or measurement error in the right-hand-side union variable rather than error in the left-hand-side wage variable correlated with union status permits researcher to address this issue.
188~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Match Bias~…the match bias measure provided absent of covariates is equivalent to the measure given for attenuation bias due to misclassification of a binary variable (union status), absent covariates or assuming zero correlation between union status and covariates.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the census hot deck procedure matches an earnings nonrespondent with an earnings donor identical with respect to match characteristics but not non-match characteristics such as union status. 
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…donor earnings on the left-hand side can be treated as a valid observation whose right-hand side characteristics, apart from union status (or other non-match attributes), are measured without error. The regression then includes valid donor observations whose misclassified union status produces a biased estimate of the union wage gap. Identification of measurement error bias in the union coefficient thus provides an estimate o the match bias from earnings impuation within a regresion framework.
188~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Match Bias~...the regression includes valid donor observations whose misclassified union status produces a biased estimate of the union wage gap. Identification of measurement error bias in the union coefficient thus provides an estimate o the match bias from earnings impuation within a regresion framework.
188~DV4~L13~Variable Value~Donor Earnings~…donor earnings on the left-hand side can be treated as a valid observation whose right-hand side characteristics, apart from union status (or other non-match attributes), are measured without error. 
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…although most explanatory variables are included in the census match list, there will exist measurement error among donor observations for covariates that are not match criteria (e.g. industry status). This complication is ignored.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…donors are obtained from the CPS and may be included twice in the regression sample, first as a donor and second as a regular obsrevation. Replicate observations will lead to downward bias in standard errors. Pairs of replicates have union misclassification error in the donor observations but not in the paired regular observations. This complication is ignored.
188~D1~V5~Variable~Union Status~…an issue arises in the measurement error bias due to reporting error in the union status variable.
188~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Match Bias~…an issue arises in the measurement error bias due to reporting error in the union status variable. In order to focus on impuation match bias, researchers ignore the standard form of measurement error which is so large in wage level analysis.
188~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Attenuation Bias~…the attenuation bias absent covariates.
188~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~Attenuation Bias~…yields values very close to the attenuation coefficient, which treats the original right-hand-side as the true sample.
188~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Classification~…equal to one minus the misclassification errors.
188~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~R-Squared~…the explained variance from a regression of observed union status on all other covariates.
188~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient from Misclassification Error With Covariates~…the attenuation coefficient from misclassification error with covariates can be approximate by dividing the attenuation bias absent covariates minus the R-squared by one minus the misclassification errors and then dividing the result by one minus the R-squared.
188~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~R-Squared~…if union status is correlated with the explanatory variables then the R-squared is greater than 0.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…if union status is correlated with the explanatory variables, bias from misclassification error is exacerbated by the addition of covariates. 
188~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient from Misclassification Error With Covariates~…the intuition is that bias is a function of the error variance divided by the variance of observed union status, conditional on covariates. Earnings covariates correlated with union status reduce variance in the denominator.
188~D1~F4~Findings~Attenuation Coefficient and Attenuation Bias~…in subsequent work using a pooled 1996-2001 CPS sample, researchers regress union status on other earnings covariates and obtain an R-squared of .1136 (much of the explanatory power results from industry, occupation, and region dummies. Researchers obtain an estimate for the attenuation coefficient from measurement error with covariates of .684, as compared to the attenuation coefficient without covariates of .759 absent covariates or an attenuation bias of .756 accounting for changes in the sample composition but not covariates.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the the current analysis of union wage gaps, the data sources are the May 1973 through May 1981 CPS and the CPS-ORG earnings files from 1983 to 2001. Subsequent analysis of industry and other sectoral wage differentials is based on the combined 1996-2001 CPS-ORG sample.
188~D1~T2~Time Period~1973-1981~…in the analysis of union wage gaps, one data source is the May 1973 through May 1981 CPS.
188~D1~T3~Time Period~1983-2001~…in the analysis of union wage gaps, one data source is the CPS-ORG earnings file from 1983 to 2001.
188~D1~T1~Time Period~1996-2001~…subsequent analysis of industry and other sectoral wage differentials is based on the combined 1996 to 2001 CPS-ORG sample.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS-ORG earnings files made available to researchers are prepared by the U.S. Census for use by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which then makes these files available to the research community. The information provided on the BLS's CPS earnings files regarding allocated earnings has varied in important ways over time. Figures are compiled for all employed wage and salary workers ages 16 and over with reported positive usual weekly earnings (weekly earnings designated as missing are retained for 1973-1978). Second, allocation rates are compile for the estimation subsample of private nonagricultural workers.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the 1973-1978 May CPS earnings files formed the basis for much early research on labor unions and industry differentials, among other topics. On these files, individuals who do not report earnings are included but weekly earnings are listed as missing. Hence, researchers using the May 1973-78 CPS to estimate wage equations, knowingly or unkowingly, exclude allocated earners. During the 1973-78 period, the percentage of wage and salary workers whose weekly earnings are missing ranges between 18% and 22%. These are primarily workers who did not report earnings.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…beginning in 1979, imputed earnings were included in the edited earnings field, along with allocation flags designating which individuals have reported earnings and which imputed earnings. This was true for the monthly CPS-ORG files, which began in January 1979 but did not yet include union status information, and for the May 1979, 1980 and 1981 CPS earnings files, which included union status. Allocation rates found for the full-year 1979-82 ORG files (which do not include union status) are reported for all wage and salary workers. 
188~D1~T4~Time Period~1979-1982~…beginning in 1979, imputed earnings were included in the edited earnings field, along with allocation flags designating which individuals have reported earnings and which imputed earnings. This was true for the monthly CPS-ORG files, which began in January 1979 but did not yet include union status information, and for the May 1979, 1980 and 1981 CPS earnings files, which included union status. Allocation rates found for the full-year 1979-82 ORG files (which do not include union status) are reported for all wage and salary workers. 
188~D1~F5~Findings~Allocation Rates Across CPS Sources~...the percentage designated as allocated in the 1979-1981 estimation samples are 19% in the May 1979 half sample and 16% in the May 1980 and 1981 quarter samples. Turning to the CPS-ORG monthly earnings files for 1983-88, allocation rates were 14% -15% in most years (the exception is 1986).
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the May 1979 and 1980 CPS include union status information for all rotation groups, while the May 1981 CPS includes it only for the quarter sample. Earnings are reported for only a half sample in May 199 and for quarter samples in 1980 and 1981. There were no union questions in 1982. Union status questions were asked every month to a quarter sample (the outgoing rotation groups) beginning with the January 1983 CPS-ORG.
188~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Allocation Rates~…the proportion of CPS Wage and Salary Earners Designated as Allocated, by Year.
188~D1~T5~Time Period~1973-1978~…nonrespondents included in files with missing earnings; no allocated earnings designation. Allocation rates for this period report the proportion with missing weekly earnings.
188~D1~T6~Time Period~1979-1988~…nonrespondents have weekly earnings imputed. File include valid allocation designation. Allocation rates for this period report the proportion designated as allocated.
188~D1~T7~Time Period~1989-1993a~…nonrespondents have weekly earnings imputed. Allocation flag identifies about one-quarter of allocated earners. Allocation rates for this period report the proportion disgnated as allocated.
188~D1~T8~Time Period~1989-1993b~…nonrespondents have weekly earnings imputed. Unedited earnings used to identify allocated earners. Allocation rates for this period report the proportion with missing values for unedited weekly earnings.

188~D1~T10~Time Period~1995 (Sept.)-Current~…nonrespondents have weekly earnings imputed. Files include valid allocation designation. Allocation rates for this period report the proportion designated as allocated.
188~DV22~L14~Variable Value~Proportion Designated As Allocated~…for the time periods spanning 1979-1988, 1989-1993a, and 1995 (Sept.)-current, the allocation rate is reported as the proportion designated as allocated.
188~DV22~L15~Variable Value~Proportion with Missing Weekly Earnings~…for the time period spanning 1973-1978, the allocation rate is reported as the proportion designated as allocated.
188~DV22~L16~Variable Value~Proportion with Missing Values for Unedited Weekly Earnings~…for the time period spanning 1983-1993b, the allocation rate is reported as the proportion with missing values for unedited weekly earnings.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…samples of ""All W&S Employees"" include all employed wage and salary workers age 16 and over with positive values for usual weekly earnings (the 1973-78 samples include those with ""missing"" weekly earnings. The ""Private Sector Estimation Sample"" correspond to analysis on private sector employees only. Additional restrictions are that observations be private secotr nonagricultural wage and salary workers, with no missing observations on control variables included in the estimated wage equation, and a real wage between $3.00 and $150. Sample sizes for ""All W&S Employees"" are an average 50,028 fo the years 1973-78 (including those with missing earnings); 25,596 in 1979; 16,085 in 1980; 14,713 in 1981; and an average 168,311 for 1983-2001."
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the 1979-82 figures for all wage and salary workers are imputation rates in the full-year 1979-82 ORG files (these do not include union status). Rates from the May files used in the analysis are 1979 = .184, 1980 = .159, and 1981 = .161.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…beginning in January 1989, earnings allocation flags included in the CPS-ORG are unreliable. They designate about 4% of workers as having imputed earnings, which is roughly a quarter of those who in fact had their earnings allocated. An alternative method exists to identify allocated earners. The ORG files during these years contain an ""unedited"" weekly earnings variable. Those with missing unedited weekly earnings (and valid edited weekly earnings) are designated as having earnings allocated. Those with non-missing unedited earnings are assumed to have been earnings respondents. This method appears to provide a reliable measure of non-response for most workers."
188~D1~T7~Time Period~1989-1993a~…beginning in January 1989, earnings allocation flags included in the CPS-ORG are unreliable. They designate about 4% of workers as having imputed earnings, which is roughly a quarter of those who in fact had their earnings allocated. An alternative method exists to identify allocated earners (*SEE 1989-1993b).
188~D1~T8~Time Period~1989-1993b~"...an alternative method exists to identify allocated earners during this period when earnings alloction flags included in the CPS-ORG are unreliable. The ORG files during these years contain an ""unedited"" weekly earnings variable.

Those with non-missing unedited earnings are assumed to have been earnings respondents."
188~DV22~L16~Variable Value~Proportion with Missing Values for Unedited Weekly Earnings~...those with missing unedited weekly earnings (and valid edited weekly earnings) are designated as having earnings allocated. Those with non-missing unedited earnings are assumed to have been earnings respondents. This method appears to provide a reliable measure of non-response for most workers.
188~DV22~L16~Variable Value~Proportion with Missing Values for Unedited Weekly Earnings~…about 15% of workers in the 1989 to 1992 estimation samples are designated as nonrespondents based on this method. A slightly higher rate (16.7% is found for 1993.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…following CPS revisions in 1994, there were no usable earnings allocation flags in the CPS-ORG files for January 1994 through August 1995. The series of questions used by the census to form the ""edited"" usual weekly earnings field became more complex following the 1994 CPS redesign. if a response is missing or replaced on any part of the sequence of questions, the census utilizes its imputation procedure.

188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…during September 1995, an accurate allocation flag for the usual weekly earnings variable was included. For the period September 1995 through 1998, 22% to 24% of individuals had imputed earnings. The substantial increase in earnings allocation from about 17% in 1993 to 22%-24% in the period 1995-98 is likely to be the result of changes in the CPS.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the 1996-2001 CPS sample is used to compare characteristics of private sector wage and salary workers with and without allocated (imputed) earnings. The sample includes 719,632 private nonagricultural employed wage and salary workers aged 16 and over.
188~D1~V5~Variable~Union Status~…the attribute of most concern to the current research is union status.
188~D1~F6~Findings~Union Density and Imputation~…union density is 9.5% among respondents versus 9.8% among nonrespondents. Among union members, 26.5% have their earnings imputed, compared to 25.7% of nonunion workers. Although these differences are small, the higher nonresponse rate among union workers as compared with nonunion workers increases match bias slightly. In general, the similarity in measured characteristics among respondents and nonrespondents suggests that there may be little bias in earnings function parameters attaching to those attributes included as imputation match criteria.
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~"…union wage gaps are reported with and without ""correction"" for match bias. This comparison provides insight into what has been a puzzle regarding changes in the union premium in the late 1970s and early 1980s and into the magnitude of recent declines in the premium."
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…provides estimates of union-nonunion log wage gaps for all private sector nonagricultural wage and salary workers, with and without control for standard CPS worker and job characteristics and with and without inclusion of workers whose earnings are imputed.
188~DV1~L17~Variable Value~Union Wage Gap Without Covariates~…the union wage gap without covariates is the difference in mean log wages for union and nonunion workers.
188~DV1~L18~Variable Value~Union Wage Gap With Covariates~…the union wage gap with covariates is the coefficient on a union membership dummy variable from a log wage equation with inclusion of standard control variables.
188~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Hourly Earnings~…hourly earnings are defined as usual weekly earnings divided by usual hours worked per week.
188~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Hourly Earnings~…top-coded weekly earnings are assigned the mean above the cap, based on the assumption that the upper tail of the earnings distribution follows a Pareto distribution. Omitted for quality control are a small number of workers with implicit wages less than $3.00 and greater than $150 (in 2001 dollars).

Estimates from sample in which allocated earners are excluded (in those years possible) are characterized as ""corrected."" For the years 1994-95, where allocated earners cannot be identified, researchers provide estimates of what the union gap would be were it estimated for a sample with allocated earners excluded. This is done by adjusting the 1994-95 gaps upward by .043 log points, the average difference for 1996-98 in estimates with and without allocated earners."
188~D1~T9~Time Period~1994-1995 (Aug.)~…for the years 1994-95, where allocated earners cannot be identified, researchers provide estimates of what the union gap would be were it estimate for a sample with allocated earners excluded.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…ignored in this analysis are issues such as specification, the endogeneity of union status, differences between nonmember covered and not covered, unmeasured worker and job attributes, and employee-employee selection on skills and tastes.
188~D1~V5~Variable~Union Status~…there was no union status variable in 1982.

Columns labeled ""Corrected for Match Bias"" attempt to include only workers reporting earnings. Columns labeled ""Observed Attenuation"" present the ratio of the uncorrected union gap to the corrected union gap (calculated prior to rounding). "
188~DV1~L17~Variable Value~Union Wage Gap Without Covariates~…for 1994-95, the corrected gap is adjusted upward by the  bias during 1996-98 (.050 for the raw gap).
188~DV1~L18~Variable Value~Union Wage Gap With Covariates~…for 1994-95, the corrected gap is adjusted upward by the  bias during 1996-98 (.043 for the regression gap).
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…sample sizes are an average 32,102 for 1973-78 for the samples without allocated earners; for the sample including allocated earners, 20,446 in 1979, 12,804 in 1980, 11,833 in 191, and an average 133,613 for 1983-2001. 
188~D1~F7~Findings~Average Standard Errors Across Time Spans~…standard errors for the regression estimates are an average .006 for the years 1973-78, .007 in 1979, .009 in 1980, .009 in 1981, and an average .004 for 1983-2001.
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…in later specifications, wage gap estimates are presented in which the full sample is included but with nonrespondent earnings assigned by the researchers using hot-deck imputation in which union status is an explicit match criterion.
188~D1~F8~Findings~Private Sector Union Gap Across Sample Specifications~…using the standard approach, estimates indiate a 6 percentage point decline in the private sector union gap, from .205 in 1978 to .148 in 1979. Exclusion of allocated earners in 1979 eliminates match bias and produces time-consistent estimates between 1973-78 and later years. Researchers obtain an estimate for May 1979 of .180, a more modest .025 decline from the .205 estimate for 1978. Although these results are not entirely consistent with changes seen in contract data (Freeman, 1986), any remaining discrepancy can be readily reconciled by the relatively small sizes or possible nonrepresentativeness of the May samples.
188~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Earnings~…if the earnings of nonrespondents differ in ways not accounted for by measurable variables, neither sample contains accurate information on the earnings of nonrespondents, the one sample omitting nonrespondents and the other matching them to donors that differ from them in an unknown manner.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…if the earnings of nonrespondents differ in ways not accounted for by measurable variables, neither sample contains accurate information on the earnings of nonrespondents, the one sample omitting nonrespondents and the other matching them to donors that differ from them in an unknown manner.
188~D1~F9~Findings~Wage Premium from 1993 to 2001 Across Sample Specifications~…the premium between 1993 and 2001 drops by .052 log points, from .180 to .128. Part of this decline, however, reflects recent increases in the proportion of allocated earners. During the same 1993 to 2001 period, the corrected series declines .035 log points, from .217 to .182. Hence, use of the uncorrected CPS will cause researchers to overstate the decline in relative union-nonunion wages.
188~D1~F10~Findings~Match Bias Across Time Spans and Sample Specifications~…match bias resulting from imputed earnings is readily evident in both the unadjusted and regression-based union wage gaps. Prior to 1994, the regression gaps appear biased downward by about .03 log points - an average .031 during 1983-88 and .033 during 1989-93. Since 1994, inclusion of allocated earners causes a more substantial understatement in union gaps, an average .043 log points in 1996-1998 and .054 in 1999 to 2001. The large bias in recent years is in line with expectations, given the increase in the porportion of allocated earners (see the triangles in fig. 1).
188~D1~F11~Findings~1983 Analysis Results~…in 1983, the proportion imputed is .138, and so the response rate is equal to .862. The ratio of the 1983 regression wage gaps is .194/.227 = .853, which is very close to the response rate. In 2001, with allocation rate .305 and response rate .695, researchers obtain a wage ratio .128/.182 = .703, which is agin nearly identical to the respnse rate. The simple attenuation estimate of the response rate tracks observed attenuation remarkably well. It has a mean absolute deviation from the annual wage gap ratio of only .013.
188~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Proportion of Imputed Earnings~…this measure is used to compare the predicted and observed rates of attenuation by year over the entire 1979 to 2001 period (ignoring 1994 and using September to December 1995 results).
188~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Predicted Attenuation Rates~…researchers also calculate predicted attenuation rates based on union-specific imputation rates and estimated rates of donor match, based on their own hot-deck procedure.
188~D1~F12~Findings~Predicted Attenuation Rates and Match Bias~…when computing predicted attenuation rates based on union-specific imputation rates and estimated rates of donor match, the mean absolute prediction error using the relevant measure was .019. Match bias tended to be slightly underpredicted (average deviation of the attenuation coefficient was .017).
188~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Wage Gap~…note that the deviation in predicted and observed attenuation is not the difference in the log wage gap.
188~D1~F13~Findings~Wage Gap Absent Attenuation and the Mean Deviation~…if the wage gap absent attenuation were .20, then the prediction error would be .013 times .20, or .0026 log points. In contrast to the mean absolute deviation, the mean deviation is effectively zero (-.0004).
188~D1~F14~Findings~Union Imputation Rates and Donor Match Rates~…union imputation rates are similar or slightly higher than nonunion rates. Based on the hot deck procedure, match of a union donor to union nonrespondents is about twice as likely as a union match to nonunion nonrespondents. Both rates fell steadily between 1979-81 and 2001, with the proportion of union donors assigned to  union nonrespondents falling from  .344 to .160 and the proportion of union donors assigned to nonunion nonrespondents falling from .173 to .088.
188~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient~…an attenuation coefficient of 0 implies complete attenuation (bias), and a value of 1.0 implies no attenuation (bias).
188~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient from Misclassification Error With Covariates~…the observed attenuation coefficient is the ratio of the union coefficients with and without allocated earners included in the sample.
188~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient~…the attenuation coefficient is measured as 1 minus the full sample proportion of allocated earners.
188~D1~F15~Findings~Observed Attenuation, Predicted Attenuation, and Simple Attenuation~…the mean absolute difference between observed attenuation and predicted attenuation is an average .046 over the 1979-2001 period, substantially larger than the average of .013 based on the attenuation coefficient.
188~D1~F16~Findings~Wage Differential Match Bias~…wage differential match bias is sizable for the measurement of relative union-nonunion earnings, causing recent union wage gaps to be understated by at least 5 percentage points. 
188~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Alternative Earnings~…an alternative hot deck imputation procedure is implemented. Instead of using census imputation value, wage values are obtained using simple hot deck matching methods, with and without union status as a match criterion. The purpose of this exercise is threefold. First, it demonstrates whether the large discrepancy between estimated wage gaps with and without the inclusion of allocated earners is in fact the result of union status being excluded as a match criterion. Second, union gap estimates obtained when allocated earners are excluded can be compared with results obtained for the full sample using an imputation method with union as a match criterion. third, information is gathered on the mix of donors matched to union and nonunion nonrespondents, which allows for the calculation and comparison of expected and observed attenuation.
188~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Alternative Earnings~…a cell hot deck imputation procedure is used. It includes 240 cells classified by gender (2 groups), age (4), education (3), occupation (5), and full- or part-time status (2). These 240 classifications are less detailed than the census hot deck procedure using 14,976 cells. The limited number of cells insures that a match for all nonrespondents is found, it eases the computational burden, and it permits the use of multiple imputation since there are generally many possible donors in a cell.
188~D1~V1~Variable~Gender~…a paper-specific cell hot deck imputation procedure includes 240 cells, and then 480 cells, classified by 2 gender groups.
188~D1~V2~Variable~Age~…a paper-specific cell hot deck imputation procedure includes 240 cells, and then 480 cells, classified by 4 age groups.
188~D1~V3~Variable~Education~…a paper-specific cell hot deck imputation procedure includes 240 cells, and then 480 cells, classified by 3 education groups.
188~D1~V8~Variable~Occupation~…a paper-specific cell hot deck imputation procedure includes 240 cells, and then 480 cells, classified by 5 occupation groups.
188~D1~V10~Variable~Part-Time Status~…a paper-specific cell hot deck imputation procedure includes 240 cells, and then 480 cells, classified by 2 full- or part-time status.
188~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Alternative Earnings~…this paper-specific imputation program assigns a log real wage to nonrespondents (i.e., those whose earnings have been imputed by the census) by randomly selecting a donor from among all those with exactly the same combination of characteristics. In order to account for variability in match values, 50 imputation rounds for each individual, with replacement, are performed.
188~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Alternative Earnings~…a second hot deck imputation procedure is then performed, identical to the first except that it adds union membership as a match criterion, thus resulting in 480 combinations or cells. Union wage gaps using the 50 alternative data sets are then estimated.
188~D1~V5~Variable~Union Status~…the second step of the paper-specific imputation procedure adds union membership as a match criterion, thus resulting in 480 combinations or cells.
188~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Alternative Union Wage Gap~…using the paper-specific two-step imputation procedure,  union wage gaps using the 50 alternative data sets are then estimated.
188~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Alternative Union Wage Gap~…reports the union coefficient estimates based on the first round of hot decking (and its standard error), as well as the mean and standard deviation of the 50 coefficient estimates.
188~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in computing alternative earnings and union wage gaps using a paper-specific hot deck imputation procedure, researchers use data from a sample of private sector workers in the 1996-2001 CPS-ORG files (n = 719,632).
188~D1~F17~Findings~Union Log Wage Gap Across Sample Specifications~"…based on the census imputation procedure, researchers obtain a ""full sample"" union log wage gap of .145. When the 25.8% of the sample with allocated earnings is excluded, the estimated wage gap rises .05 log points to .193. When researchers use their own multiple hot deck procedure, without union status as a match criterion, a log wage gap of .141 is obtained, which is very close to the value obtained based on the more detailed census procedure. When union status is added as a match criterion (i.e., move from 240 to 480 cells), a (nearly) full sample union log wage gap of .208 results, somewhat higher than the .193 gap obtained by simply omitting allocated earners from the sample."
188~D1~F18~Findings~Donor Match Rates Through the First Imputation Step~…for the first round of the paper-specific imputation analysis, nonunion nonrespondents are matched to donors who are 9.1% union, while union nonrespondents are matched to 18.0% union (the sample mean among respondents or potential donors is 9.5% union).
188~D1~F19~Findings~Attenuation Coefficients Through the First Imputation Step~…for the first round of the paper-specific imputation analysis, the predicted attenuation coefficient, absent covariates, is .759, and, with covariates, is .648.
188~D1~F20~Findings~Union Wage Gap Through the Second Imputation Step~…focusing on unadjusted wage gaps using their own imputation procedures, researchers find a union-nonunion gap of .203 without union status as a match criterion and a gap of .265 with union as a match criterion. The implied attenuation coefficient is .2025/.2648 = .765, which is highly similar to the predicted .759 attenuation. This compares to an attenuation coefficient of .2105/.2657 = .792 based on unadjusted union gaps from the census samples with and without allocated earners.
188~D1~F21~Findings~Regression Attenuation Coefficient Through the Second Imputation Step~…focusing on unadjusted wage gaps using their own imputation procedures, researchers find a regression attenuation equal to .1410/.2081 = .678, which is again nearly identical to the attenuation coefficient with covariates equal to .684 predicted based on observed donor match rates and the correlation between union density and the regression covariates.
188~D1~F22~Findings~Attenuation w/ and w/o Allocated Earners Through the Second Imputation Step~…focusing on unadjusted wage gaps using their own imputation procedures, researchers observe less attenuation, .1452/.1928 = .753, using the CPS samples with and without allocated earners.
188~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient from Misclassification Error With Covariates~…this measure accounts for the presence of covariates.
188~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Attenuation Coefficient from Misclassification Error With Covariates~…this measure of attenuation predicts observed attenuation in samples with and without allocated earners far less well than does the simple approximation (i.e. the attenuation coefficient without covariates).
188~D1~F23~Findings~Observed Attenuation and the Aggregate Rate of Imputation~…observed attenuation based on samples with and without allocated earners is closely approximated by the aggregate rate of imputation (in the case of the 1996-2001 sample the proportion of imputed earners = .258 or the attenuation coefficient absent covariates = .742).
188~D1~M2~Methodology~Heckman Selection~"…a separate issue is the possibility of response bias. Researchers estimate a Heckman selection model in which earnings response (i.e., no imputation) is a function of all wage determinants plus the ""proxy"" variable designating if another household member provided survey information."
188~D1~V14~Variable~Proxy~"…the Heckman selection analysis is a function of all wage determinants plus the ""proxy"" variable designating if another household member provided survey information."
188~D1~F24~Findings~Proxy~…proxy is a highly important determinant of nonresponse, but a relatively unimportant determinant of the wage (proxy has a -.02 coefficient in the wage equation).
188~D1~F25~Findings~Heckman Selection Union Wage Gap Estimates~…the union gap from the selectivity-adjusted MLE wage equation is .1916 (.0020), as compared to .1928 (.0020) obtained by OLS for the sample excluding allocated earners and to .2081 (.0018) obtained with the full sample using the paper-specific imputation procedure with union as a match criteria.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in analyzing industry wage differentials, researchers estimate log wage equation using the CPS-ORG files for 1996-2001, with and without the inclusion of allocated earners. A similar set of controls is included as in the union analysis, except that 27 industry dummies are now included, with mining the reference group. Researchers measure dispersion in log wages across the 28 industries (with a zero base for mining) by, alternatively, the standard deviation and the mean absolute deviation. 
188~D1~V12~Variable~Industry~…27 industry dummies are included in log wage equations attempting to estimate sectoral wage differentials.
188~V12~L22~Variable Value~Mining~…mining is the reference industry group.
188~D1~V12~Variable~Industry~…researchers measure dispersion in log wages across the 28 industries (with a zero base for mining) by, alternatively, the standard deviation and the mean absolute deviation.
188~D1~DV30~Derived Variable~Industrial Wage Gap~…researchers measure dispersion in log wages across the 28 industries (with a zero base for mining) by, alternatively, the standard deviation and the mean absolute deviation.
188~D1~F26~Findings~Industry-Specific Analysis Estimates~…in industry analysis, the standard deviation is .131 with allocated earners excluded, compared to .103 for the full sample, an understatement in dispersion of 21.4%. A similar result is found using the mean absolute deviation, .096, with allocated earners excluded versus .076, with them included, which is a 20.8% understatement. In results not shown, a similar pattern is found during earlier years, although bias is less severe owing to a lower proportion of allocated earnings records.
188~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~"…this equation is used to provide estimates of public sector differentials, comparing non-postal-federal, postal, state, and local worker wages to those for workers with similar measured characteristics across the entire private sector. In each case, estimated gaps including allocated earners are biased toward zero. The column labeled ""Observed Attenuation"" provides the ratio of the full-sample result to the result with allocated earners omitted. In these regressions estimating public sector differentials, researchers omit controls for union status and industry, effecting a comparison of public workers with union and nonunion private workers across all industries. This approach comports well with comparability laws mandating public sector compensation equivalent to that for similar levels of work in the private sector."
188~D1~DV31~Derived Variable~Sectoral Wage Gap~…log wage regressions are used to provide estimates of public sector differentials, comparing non-postal-federal, postal, state, and local worker wages to those for workers with similar measured characteristics across the entire private sector. In each case, estimated gaps including allocated earners are biased toward zero.
188~D1~V6~Variable~Sector~…public sector differentials are measured across four sectors.
188~V6~L23~Variable Value~Non-Post-Federal~…one of four sectors used in computing public sector differentials.
188~V6~L24~Variable Value~Postal~…one of four sectors used in computing public sector differentials.
188~V6~L25~Variable Value~State~…one of four sectors used in computing public sector differentials.
188~V6~L26~Variable Value~Local Worker Wages~…one of four sectors used in computing public sector differentials.
188~D1~F27~Findings~Sector-Specific Analysis Estimates~…bias in the postal-private gap estimate is particularly large, with a log differential of .255 obtained among those reporting earnings versus a biased measure of .188 from a sample of workers including allocated earners.
188~V8~L27~Variable Value~Hispanic~…an ethnicity indicator included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~V9~L28~Variable Value~Married, Spouse Present~…a marital status indicator included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~V9~L29~Variable Value~Separated, Divorced, or Widowed~…a marital status indicator included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~D1~V15~Variable~Veteran~…an indicator for veteran status included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~D1~V16~Variable~Foreign Born~…an indicator for immigrant status included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~V13~L30~Variable Value~MSA 100,000-2.5 million~…a large metropolitan area indicator included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~V13~L31~Variable Value~MSA > 2.5 million~…a large metropolitan area indicator included in regressions estimating the effect of earnings imputation on industry, public sector, and other selected wage differentials.
188~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Match Bias~…absent covariates, the match bias is equal to the sum of match error rates (false negatives plus false positives).

189~D1~D1~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics Validation Study~…one of three datasets used to compare survey data and data from administrative sources.
189~D1~D1~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics Validation Study~…in 1983 and 1987 q questionnaire based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics questionnaire, but shorter, was administered to employees of a manufacturing company in the Detroit area to measure their earnings in the preceding years, while at the same time, payroll records of the employees were collected from the firm.
189~D1~D1~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics Validation Study~…this data is assumed to be very accurate, since the firm was highly cooperative.

189~D3~D3~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~…one of three datasets used to compare survey data and data from administrative sources.
189~D4, D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~…measurement in the administrative data will be due only to mismatching; that is, with a certain probability a value recorded in an administrative file refers to a different observation.
189~D4, D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~…measurement error in survey data can be absent, classical but potentially mean reverting, or the result of contamination.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…the analysis in this research paper is applied to Swedish data that have been collected for a validation study as part of a larger European health and retirement study.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…every Swede has a unique social security number, which is also available in every administrative record, allowing interviewers to ask respondents for their social security number and permission to link them to the information available in the administrative files; if the respondent agrees this may substantially shorten interviews, because questions, for instance about income, can be skipped and, in turn, interviews can then focus on information not available in administrative files, while combining the interview information with the (presumably) more reliable administrative information.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…as part of this data source, a pan-European data collection effort among individuals 50 and over, an experiement was devised in Sweden to assess the usefulness of combining survey and administrative data, with the purpose to inform Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe about the possibilities of combining such data and potentially implement it in other countries than Sweden.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…aspects to investigated in this survey include selectivity in survey responses in a number of important domains, reliability of selected survey measures including income and pension entitlements by comparison with administrative data, estimating biases in a number of important empirical relationships when using survey data rather than administrative data, an generalizing from these findings to the limitations of international comparisons if adminstrative data are available in some countries, but not in others.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…in the empiricial analysis in this research, a sample of individuals over age 50 are drawn from this data source.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…a registry-based longitudinal database that is representative of the Swedish population since 1960.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…this data has two subsamples including a population sample, representative of the entire population, with a coverage rate of 3.35% and an immigrant sample, covering 19.5% of the immigrant population, with both samples kept cross-sectionally and longitudinally representative of their respective populations.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…there are two principal data sources: the Income Registries, available annually since 1968, and the Population Censuses, available every fifth year from 1960 to 1990 (no census has been taken after 1990); other administrative files have been added during the nineties.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…by drawing from this data source, researchers have a wealth of information available about their respondents from the administrative data; the information in the different administrative files is linked by the social security number of individuals.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…researchers use mostly demographic variables and financial variables from this data and since the survey contained mostly questions about 2002, researchers use data from that year.
189~D5~V1~Variable~Education~…a demographic variable drawn from the Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden.
189~D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Age~…a demographic variable drawn from the Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden.

189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…a survey conducted in 2003 of 1,431 individuals age 50 or over; out of the 1,431 individual s who were contacted, 881 responded - 469 of them women and 412 men.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…the timing of this survey, just before tax returns need to be filed for Swedes, was chosen so as to optimize the information available to respondents when answering the questions in the survey.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…this questionnaire contains several questions about household income and expenses, partner income, and assets; besides the financial questions there are some smaller sections about household composition, health, retirement, and education of the respondent.
189~D4, D5~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings~…as one of the three major monetary variable concentrations in this research.
189~D4, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Pensions~…as one of the three major monetary variable concentrations in this research.
189~D4, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Taxes~…as one of the three major monetary variable concentrations in this research.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~..from the gross sample of 1,431 resondents drawn from the administrative files to the sample of respondents who answered at least some questions over the phone, the survey has  881 respondents, a response rate of 61.6%
189~D4, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Taxes~…can be reported as an amount or as a percentage of income; however, reserachers do not consider the percentage answers, as the calculated amount of taxes paid would most likely exhibit an error structure different from the other responses.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…the answer to the survey question about taxes could be given either as an amount or as a percentage of income; however, percentage answers are not considered, as the calculated amount of taxes paid would most likely exhibit an error structure different from the other responses.
189~D4, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Implied Error~…roughly speaking, the implied error is a result of takingh the ratio of two variables
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…the number of respondents in the survey with positive survey taxes is much lower than in the administrative data.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…in the original sample the number of observations with a positive amount is 765 for earnings, 828 for pensions, and 1,328 for taxes, while in the respondents sample, the number of observations with a positive amount is 511 for earnings 492 for pensions and 845 for taxes.
189~D4~F1~Findings~Gross Sample vs. Respondent Sample Age and Gender for Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…comparing the sample of respondents to the original gross sample shows that the age and gender composition is essentially the same with means of 63.6 and 63.5.
189~D4~F2~Findings~Gross Sample vs. Respondent Sample Education and Earnings for Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…the respondent sample is slightly better educated and, possibly to that, the respondents sample exhibits somewhat higher administrative earnings by 7%; however, if resaerchers only consider observations with positive earnings the difference disappears: respondents earn 1.5% less on average than the overall mean of the gross sample.
189~D4~F3~Findings~Gross Sample vs. Respondent Sample Pensions for Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…pensions among the respondents are 5% higher on average in the respondent sample than in the gross sample, and 9% higher if only positive pensions are considered.
189~D4~F4~Findings~Gross Sample vs. Respondent Sample Taxes for Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…for taxes, the difference between the respondents sample and the gross sample is 8.5% and 6% if only respondents with positive (administrative) tax payments are considered.
189~D4, D5~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings~…respondents with earnings are typically younger.
189~D4, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Pensions~…respondents with pensions are typically older.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…the survey data contained a number of questions on income and income-related variables.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…a number of measures were taken to improve survey quality and to improve immediate comparison to the administrative variables; according to Hurd et al. (2004), one way to increase the quality of report is by giving respondents the opportunity to report income in a time span consistent with how they receive their income, for example, instead of forcing respondents to provide a yearly amount for earnings and pensions, they were given the possibility to report these amounts either per month or per year.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~"…the question ""Did you have any income from employment in 2002?"" was answered affirmatively by 435 respondents."
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…when comparing earnings answers with the administrative files, discrepancies include that seventeen respondents claimed to have earnings, when according to the administrative files they have zero earnings and ninety-three respondents reported to have no earnings, when they should have earnings according to the administrative files.
189~DV3~L1~Variable Value~Low Earnings~…respondents that report earning less than 10,000 SEK per year in 2002.
189~D3~F5~Findings~Survey of Income and Program Participation Discrepencies w/ Existing Literature~…while in Pedace and Bates (2001), analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation estimates that 5.5% of those surveyed said they did not have earnings in the survey, while in the current research, that percentage is 18.2%; however Pedace and Bates (2001) find that, of those who had no earnings according to the administrative files, 18% reported earnings in the Survey of Income and Program Participation, while in the current research, that percentage is 4.6%. Thus, in percentage terms, the discrepancy between administrative data and survey data appears similar across the two data sets, but in the Survey of Public Participation zero adminstrative earnings are reported to be positive in the survey data at about the same rate as positive administartive earnings in Sweden are reported to be zero in the survey; however, not too much should be read into this, if only because of the different age compositions of the Swedish and United States samples.
189~D4, D5~F6~Findings~Pensions in Survey vs. Administrative Data ~…for the pension data, researchers find that a smaller percentage of respondents, 1.8%, report having a pension, while this is not found in the administrative data.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~...four hundred and ten respondents gave an answer to the monthly pension question, including 2 zeros, 6 refusals, and 43 don't knows, while only 26 respondents chose to give a yearly amount. For 369 respondents there exists both a postivie administrative value and a postive survey value.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…throughout this research, logarithms of the monetary variables are used to achieve distributions that are approximately symmetric.

189~D4, D5~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings~…reported in Swedish data as SEK, which represents the Swedish kronor; in 2002, 10 SEK was equal to approximately one United States dollar.
189~D4, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Taxes~…reported in Swedish data as SEK, which represents the Swedish kronor; in 2002, 10 SEK was equal to approximately one United States dollar.
189~D4, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Pensions~…reported in Swedish data as SEK, which represents the Swedish kronor; in 2002, 10 SEK was equal to approximately one United States dollar.
189~D4, D5~F7~Findings~Log Earnings in Survey vs. Administrative Data~…the difference between log earnings measured in the survey and the administrative data is on the order of 0.02 on average.
189~D4, D5~F8~Findings~Log Taxes in Survey vs. Administrative Data~…mean log-taxes are about 0.08 higher in the survey data than in the administrative data.
189~D4, D5~F9~Findings~Exact and Near Observed Earnings in Survey vs. Administrative Data~…2.5% of respondents gave an earnings amount exactly equal to the adminstrative value, while an additional 12.3% of respondents provided amounts within 1,000 SEK of the administrative value.
189~D4, D5~F10~Findings~Exact and Near Observed Pensions and Taxes in Survey vs. Administrative Data~…for the pension and taxes data used in this research, 13.3% and 5.1% of answers are exactly equal to the administrative value, with an additional 16% and 72% answers within a 1,000 SEK bound.
189~D4, D5~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings~…the true value of this variable of interest is not measured directly, but instead two sources of data, capturing the same concept, are availabe.
189~D4, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Taxes~…the true value of this variable of interest is not measured directly, but instead two sources of data, capturing the same concept, are availabe.
189~D4, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Pensions~…the true value of this variable of interest is not measured directly, but instead two sources of data, capturing the same concept, are availabe.
189~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Administrative Data Measurement Error~…errors in the administrative data are assumed to be due only to mismatching; with a certain probability, the observed administrative value is equal to the true value of the individual of interest.
189~D4, D5~DV7~Derived Variable~Probability of  True Value~…the probability that the observed administrative value is equal to the true value of the individual of interest.
189~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Administrative Data Measurement Error~…in the case of a mismatch, which occurs with probability of 1 minus the probability of an true value, the adminstrative value corresponds to the true value of someone else.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…note that the researchers' sample comes from a subset of the population, containing only individuals of age 50 and older, whereas a mismatch may come from the complete sample available in LINDA.
189~D4, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Probability of Untrue Value~…1 minus the probability of a true value.
189~D4, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Probability of  Untrue Value~…with this probability, the survey data contain response error, part of which is mean-reverting.
189~D4, D5~DV9~Derived Variable~Survey and Administrative Data Difference~...the difference between survey data and administrative data is equal to the observation from the survey data minus the observation from the administrative data.
189~D4, D5~DV9~Derived Variable~Survey and Administrative Data Difference~…note that the difference between survey data and administrative data no longer equals the response error, since in this model the administrative data may contain erro.
189~D4, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Mean Reversion~…a measure of mean reversion researchers expect to see in the data under the possibly incorrect assumption that the administrative data are measured without error.
189~D4, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Mean Reversion~…note that this variable is, for a negative probability, unambiguously negative, implying indeed mean reversion.
189~D4, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Mean Reversion~"…even without ""true"" mean reversion, the data will still suggest that mean reversion is present as long as the probability of true value does not equal one, that is, if the administrative data sufferes from at least some mismatch."
189~D4, D5~DV9~Derived Variable~Survey and Administrative Data Difference~…as soon as the administrative data suffers from measurement error, researchers expect this difference to be negatively correlated with the administrative observation.
189~D4, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Mean Reversion~…if the administrative data are assumed to be measured perfectly, the variance of the survey data can only be smaller than the variance of the administrative data if the survey data exhibit mean reversion.
189~D4, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Mean Reversion~… the bigger the measurement errors in the survey data are assumed to be, the more mean reversion one needs to rationalize the data.
189~D4, D5~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings~…measured in regressions as the logarithm of the true value for this variable.
189~D4, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Pensions~…measured in regressions as the logarithm of the true value for this variable.
189~D4, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Taxes~…measured in regressions as the logarithm of the true value for this variable.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…consider a simple log- linear regression model where the monetary variables of interest are the dependent variables.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…the conventional assumption is made that the error term is uncorrelated with the the main variable of interest and with any of the other random variables researchers have defined so far.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…if researchers only have survey data available, they would replace the dependent variable of interest by the observed survey value on the left-hand side resulting in an estimator that is consistent if there is no mean reverting error; the biasing effect of the mean reversion is mitigated by the observations that are exactly correct.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…if researchers replace the dependent variable of interest with the administrative value observation, the probability limit of the estimator is obtained so that the percent bias is equal to the percentage of mismatched administrative observations.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…consider a simple OLS model with the log of the monetary variable of interest as an explanatory independent variable.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…if the variable of interest is replaced by only the survey responses, researchers return to the case of examining classical measurement error.
189~D4, D5~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings~…the true variable is assumed to be dependent on variables such as gender, age, and education, with the error term representing Gaussian noise.
189~D4, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Pensions~…the true variable is assumed to be dependent on variables such as gender, age, and education, with the error term representing Gaussian noise.
189~D4, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Taxes~…the true variable is assumed to be dependent on variables such as gender, age, and education, with the error term representing Gaussian noise.
189~D4, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Mean Reversion~…when covariates are included into calculations determining the true value of the variable of interest, mean reversion gets a slightly different interpretation.
189~D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Age~…age one of the covariates used in determining the true value of the monetary variables of interest.
189~D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Age Squared~…age squared as one of the covariates used in determining the true value of the monetary variables of interest.
189~D5~V2~Variable~Gender~…dummies for gender as covariates used in determining the true value of the monetary variables of interest.
189~D5~V1~Variable~Education~…dummies for degree of education used in determining the true value of the monetary variables of interest.
189~D5~V3~Variable~Retirement Status~…dummies for self-assessed retirement status used in determining the true value of the monetary variables of interest.
189~V1~L3~Variable Value~dkedu~…a coded representing don't know values for education.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…for estimation, researchers write the model as a mixture of one univariate normal distribution, when the administrative data and the survey data are considered exclusively, and five bivariate normal distributions with different means and covariance matrices with maximum likelihood used to obtain the estimates.
189~D4, D5~V4~Variable~Interest~…another monetary variable of interest analyzed in some specifications of the dependent and independent estimation models.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…besides the full model, three other models are estimated, with certain constraints imposed on the full model, including a model without contamination of the survey data, a model where no mismatching occurs, and a model where both are left out, the last of which can be seen as the model used in most previous studies, with only the addition that survey observations are equal to the truth positive probability.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…besides the full model, three other models are estimated, with certain constraints imposed on the full model, including a model without contamination of the survey data, a model where no mismatching occurs, and a model where both are left out, the last of which can be seen as the model used in most previous studies, with only the addition that survey observations are equal to the truth positive probability.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…the LINDA variable used to define age as bald, which is the age of the individual at the end of the tax year.
189~D5~V5~Variable~Bald~…the age of the individual at the end of the tax year as reported in the Longitudinal Individual data for Sweden.
189~D5~DV2~Derived Variable~Age~…researchers define age equal to the reported bald age minus 40 (bald - 40).
189~D5~DV11~Derived Variable~Age Squared~…researchers define age squared equal to the reported bald age minus 40 squared divided by 100 (bald - (40^2/100)).
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…since it is sometimes found that women provide more accurate answers than men, models are estimated where the mean and mean reversion are allowed to differ by gender.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…since it is sometimes found that women provide more accurate answers than men, models are estimated where the mean and mean reversion are allowed to differ by gender.
189~D4, D5~F11~Findings~Mean and Mean Reversions~…when the mean and mean reversions are allowed to differ by gender, for earnings, the estimate of mean reversion is 0.100 for men and 0.104 for women, while the t-value of the difference is 0.33; the t-value for the difference in mean is even lower with a value of 0.10.
189~D4, D5~F12~Findings~Correct Survey Data and Contaminated Survey Data~…the estimated percentage of correct survey data ranges from 15% in the earnings data to a little over 25% in the pension data, whereas the fraction of contaminated survey values lies between 0.04 and 0.13.
189~D4, D5~F13~Findings~Probability of Untrue Value~…the estimate of the probability of untrue values varies from 2% in the pension data to about 8% in the tax data.
189~D4, D5~F14~Findings~Dependent Monetary Variables~…when the monetary variables are dependent, biases are modest, with the administrative data leading to slightly smaller biases than the survey data for pensions, whereas for earnings and taxes survey data yield less bias, with values on the order of 5%.
189~D4, D5~F15~Findings~Independent Monetary Variable Results w/ Administrative Data~…when the monetary variables are independent, biases are very large, with values up to 65%; when using administrative data, it is found that the bias is largest for earnings at about 50%, a result that is due to the fact that the 4% mismatched data appear to be drawn from a distribution that has a much lower log mean at 9.187 compared to 12.283, and substantially higher dispersion at 1.807 compared to 0.717.
189~D4, D5~F16~Findings~Independent Monetary Variable Results w/ Survey Data~…when the monetary variables are independent, biases are very large, with values up to 65%; for the survey data the bias is particularly large in the case of pensions, at about 65%, a result that is mostly likely due to the low mean and high variance of the contaminated data with values of -1.632 and 3.801 respectively.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…maximum likelihood estimation is used in the full model estimations.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…ordinary least squares models are applied twice, once with administrative data as dependent variable and once with survey data as a dependent variable.
189~D4, D5~M3~Methodology~Median Regressions~…median regression models are applied twice, once with administrative data as the dependent variable and once with survey data as the dependent variable.
189~D4, D5~M4~Methodology~Robust Regressions~…robust regression models are applied twice, once with administrative data as the dependent variable and once with survey data as the dependent variable.
189~D4, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…running ordinary least squares of the administrative variables on the explanatory variables provides estimates close to those of the full model.
189~D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Linear Log~…since the full model is a mixture of a number of different regimes, it is of interest to assign observations to different regimes and to do so, researchers must use the fact that the likelihood for each observation is a weighted sum of densities corresponding to the different regimes; observations have been assigned to the regime that produces the highest density for that observation.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…for about 70% of this data sample, a third source of earnings information is available from employer records, consisting of two variables, one containing the full-time equivalent monthly earnings and one containing the percentage of full-time equivalent employed.
189~D5~V6~Variable~FTE Monthly Earnings~…an employer record drawn from the LINDA data source indicating the full-time equivalent monthly earnings for each individual respondent.
189~D5~V7~Variable~Perecentage of FTE Employed~…an employer record drawn from the LINDA data source indicating the perecentage of full-time equivalent employed in the relevant LINDA sample.
189~D4, D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~…a simple way to look for possible mismatches is to consider observations where survey and employer earnings are faily close, while differeing substantially from the administrative data.
189~D4, D5~F17~Findings~Survey and Administrative Data Difference When Earnings Are At Least 50,000 SEK~…if researchers select observations for which survey earnings and administrative earnings are at least 50,000 SEK apart, while survey earnings and employer earnings differ by less than 10,000 SEK, we find 12 cases where this condition holds true; for these 12 observations the ratio of survey and administrative earnings varies between 0.5 and 4.5.
189~D5~D5~Dataset~Longitudinal Individual Data for Sweden~…researchers assume that the administrative data are a mixture of two normal distributions.
189~D4~D4~Dataset~Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe~…researchers assume that the survey data are a mixture of three different normal distributions.
189~D4, D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Group 1~…the group of observations where both administrative and survey data are correct.
189~D4, D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Group 1~…observations are labeled as a member of group 1 if the difference between the administrative data and survey data is smaller than 1,000 SEK.
189~D4, D5~DV7~Derived Variable~Probability of  True Value~…the proportion of survey observations that differ less than 1,000 SEK from the administrative data; in principle, this broader definition of equal observations affects the consistency of the researchers estimates, yet these effects are expected to be minor.
190~190: Measurement Error in the Current Population Survey: A Nonparametric Look~~~~
190~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…this article utilizes an exact match file between the 1978 March Current Population Survey and administrative records from the Social Security Administration to analyze errors in the reporting of annual income using non-parametric methodology.
190~D1~T1~Time Period~1978.0~…relevant survey year from which March Current Population Survey data was included in a match dataset along with Social Security Administration data.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…the advanatage of this methodology is that results are not biased because of specification error.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…the disadvantage of using this methodology is a loss in efficiency and an inability to extrapolate beyond the support of the observed data.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…this study finds that reported earnings in the Current Population Survey have a measurement error that is systematically related to true earnings and gender.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…used as an extension of findings in Bound and Krueger (1991) to examine the extent of measurement error in earnings reports.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…the research in this article focuses on an expanded sample including women who were not heads of households and examines a cross-sectional sample in addition to the more restrictive panel structure.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…in an effort to improve the accuracy of the data collected for the Current Population Survey, the Bureau of the Census with the cooperation of the Social Security Administration conducted an exact match study where Current Population Survey data were matched to Social Security Administration Data.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…this data contains the usual Annual Demographic File variables, and data supplied by the Social Security Administration including earnings for 1977, 1976, and previous years.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…this reseach utilizes the public use files generated from the 1978 Current Population Survey and the Social Security Administration exact match file, in which approximately 50% of the original Current Population Survey sample was successfully matched.
190~D2~D2~Dataset~Annual Demographic File~…data from the 1977 Current Population Survey Annual Demographic File as a survey of interest in this data.
190~D1, D2, D3~V1~Variable~Gender~…used in order to differentiate measurement error trends between Social Security Administration data and Current Population Survey data by gender.
190~D2~T2~Time Period~1977.0~…relevant survey year from which Annual Demographic File data from the Current Population Survey was drawn.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…the samples used in this research are constructed identically to those used in Bound and Krueger in that researchers construct a panel sample using the CPS-SSA data and the Annual Demographic File data, while maintaining sample focus on heads of houses; exceptions include that women who are either the household or the spouse of the householder are included and that cross-sectional samples are constructed in addition to panel samples similar to those of Bound and Krueger.
190~D2~D2~Dataset~Annual Demographic File~…the samples used in this research are constructed identically to those used in Bound and Krueger in that researchers construct a panel sample using the CPS-SSA data and the Annual Demographic File data, while maintaining sample focus on heads of houses; exceptions include that women who are either the household or the spouse of the householder are included and that cross-sectional samples are constructed in addition to panel samples similar to those of Bound and Krueger.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Sample~…samples used here are constructed identically to those found in Bound and Krueger with the sample focus on heads of households only, however, women who are either the householder or the spouse of the householder are included and cross-sectional samples are constructed in addition to panel samples similar to those of Bound and Krueger.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Sample~…four samples of interest are considered.
190~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Sample 1~…this sample selects male heads of household who are present in both the 1977 March Annual Demographic File and in the 1978 Current Population Survey-Social Security Administration Exact Match data.
190~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Sample 2~…this sample contains females who are either heads of household or wives of the head of the household and are present in both the 1977 March Annual Demographic File and the 1978 Current Population Survey-Social Security Administration Exact Match file.
190~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Sample 1~…this sample constitutes one out of two panel samples.
190~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Sample 2~…this sample constitutes one out of two panel samples.
190~DV1~L3~Variable Value~Sample 3~…this sample includes male heads of household from the 1978 Current Population Survey-Social Security Administration Exact Match file selected identically to sample 1 except not matched to the 1977 data.
190~DV1~L4~Variable Value~Sample 4~…this sample contains women heads of households and wives selected  identically to sample 2 but not matched to the 1977 data.
190~DV1~L3~Variable Value~Sample 3~…this sample constitutes one of two cross-sectional samples.
190~DV1~L4~Variable Value~Sample 4~…this sample constitutes one of two cross-sectional samples.
190~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Sample 1~…this sample is a proper subset of Sample 3.
190~DV1~L2~Variable Value~Sample 2~…this sample is a proper subset of Sample 4.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…the earnings data reported by the Social Security Administration are censored at $16,500 for 1977 income and at 15,300 for 1976 income; less than 3% of the women earn more than the threshold while approximately 40% of the men earn more than the threshold.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…the voluntary aspect of participation in this match study leads to potential selection bias.
190~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Tobit~…Bound and Krueger (1991) addressed the top coding problem by modeling the response error as a Tobit and using maximum likelihood estimation; the approach here is to use the Social Security earnings as a right-hand-side variable, hence, no selection bias exists, but extrapolation to higher values of earnings is tenuous.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…one would expect that those individuals who refuse to participate in the match to SSA data are most likely to have knowingly misrepresented their income.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~…an unresolved issue in this data is the potential of earnings not reported to the Social Security Administration but reported to the Current Population Survey; there is no way of determining these under-the-table earnings and may explain the subsequent finding that low-income men overreport earnings to the Curren Population Survey.
190~D3~D3~Dataset~May Current Population Survey~…in order to examine the propensity to overreport/underreport in either the Current Population Survey or the Social Security Administration data, data from the May 1985 Current Population Survey and the May 1991 Current Population Survey data was used, which ask supplemental questions concerning second jobs.
190~D3~T3~Time Period~1985.0~…relevant survey year from which May Current Population Survey was drawn in order to examine the propensity to overreport/underreport in the Current Population Survey or the Social Security Administration data.
190~D3~T4~Time Period~1991.0~…relevant survey year from which May Current Population Survey was drawn in order to examine the propensity to overreport/underreport in the Current Population Survey or the Social Security Administration data.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Reporting Error~…defined as the reported earnings in the Current Population Survey minus the Social Security Administration reported earnings.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Reporting Error~…two sets of comparisons are of particular importance: first, the panel data sets are compared with the cross sectional data sets, a comparison that tests the hypothesis that use of only the panel data sets results in selecting individuals who are better reporters than those in the population as a whole, and second, reporting errors are compared between men and women.
190~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Null Hypothesis Regarding Mean Error Across Samples~…the null hypothesis that the mean error is the same between samples 1 and 3 is rejected at all standard confidence intervals, while the null hypothesis that the variances are the same cannot be rejected.
190~D1, D2, D3~F2~Findings~Asymptotic Standard Normal Test for Mean Error for Men~…the asymptotic standard normal test of difference in mean error between samples 1 and 3 had a value of -2.8; the test of differences in variance had a value of -1.85, while the asymptotic test of the joint hypothesis had a value of 9.6
190~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~Asymptotic Standard Normal Test for Mean Error for Women~…the asymptotic standard normal test for differences in the mean error between samples 2 and 4 had a value of -0.64, while the test of differences in variance had a value of -2.26; the asymptotic test of the joint hypothesis had a value of 5.16.
190~D1, D2, D3~F4~Findings~Null Hypothesis Acceptance or Rejction for Sample 3 and Sample 4 ~…comparing men with women, in Sample 3 vs. Sample 4, soundly rejects the null hypothesis that the errors for men and women have the same mean and variance, a finding that indicates that men have a higher mean error and a higher variance error, i.e. men are less accurate reporters than women.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Normality~…a simple test of normality is to compare the third central moment with zero and the fourth central moment to three times the quare of the variance.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Normality~…since both samples contain a large proportion of respondents who report exactly, i.e. 11.7% of the men and 12.7% of the women, tests were also performed for the samples without these respondents.
190~D1, D2, D3~F5~Findings~Normality Test Results~…the results of normality tests soundly reject the null hypothesis of normality for the log errors; the errors are found to be asymmetrically distributed (positively) and have thick tails (leptokurtic).
190~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Tobit~…the large asymmetry of the error distribution apparent in the researchers' sample suggests that analysis utilizing Tobit estimation may lead to a large bias.
190~D2, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Reporting Error~…one approach to analyzing the measurement error process is to consider the traditional definition of measurement error where one would take the observed value in the Current Population Survey data minus the observed value in the Social Security Administration value.
190~D1, D2, D3~F6~Findings~Asymptotic Standard Normal Test for Mean Error for Men and Women~…the asymptotic standard normal test for differences in mean error between samples 3 and 4 has a value of 9.7, while the test for differences in variance has a value of 9.4; the asymptotic test of the joint hypothesis has a value of 112.5.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Reporting Error~…descriptive statistics are constructed using this definition.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Structural Measurement Error~…the more general approach of measurement error can be viewed as a structural analysis.
190~D1, D2, D3~F7~Findings~Test Values by Gender w/ and w/o Exact Reporters~…for the men, the third-moment test value is 79, the fourth-moment test value is 403, and the joint test value is 168,157, while for the women, the test values are 58, 40, and 166,435, respectively; for the men, without exact reporters, the test values are 69, 331, and 114,342, respectively, while for the women, without exact reporters, the test values are 54, 33 and 109,556, respectively.
190~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey/SSA~"…the response to the question ""Last year (1977) did the respondent receive any money in wages or salary?"" from the Current Populatio Survey is structurally determined by the true value of income and perhaps other factors from the SSA data."
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…the regressions of interest in determining structural error have the expected value of the Current Population Survey data dependent on the Social Security Adminstration true value for a variable as a dependent variable and a function representing any systematic reporting behavior on the Social Security Administration true value and the variable of interest, while the residual from these is stochastic noise.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…in nonparametric regression, it is only necessary to assume that the function be twice continuously differentiable.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…the estimator reveals to the reseacher any nonlinearities present without requiring the research to incure the pretest bias associated with arriving at a functional form through the trial and error of various nonlinear specifications, with the cost being slower convergence and thus less precise estimates at any given sample size.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~"…the nonparametric approach is well suited to problems where the data set is relatively large and the researcher has particular interest in observing the true relationship rather than testing specific parameters of a model; thus the question asked in this model is not simply ""what is the bias in OLS from the measurement error?"" but rather, ""what is the relationship between the truth and the observed response, on average?"""
190~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Tobit~…estimation with this model leads to potential bias from misspecification when the normality assumption is violated.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…by utilizing nonparametric estimation, the nonlinear relationship between response and income for men was found.
190~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Non-Parametric Methodology~…estimates of this type are also used to test particular specifications of the function of interest.
190~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Systematic Reporting Behavior Function~"…a function included in the non-parametric methodology reporting any systematic reporting behavior, while the ""residual"" from there is stochastic noise."
190~DV5~L5~Variable Value~Identity Function~…if the systematic reporting behavior function is simply the identity function, then the response error is an additive white-noise term, an error process that is often assumed in treatment of measurement error.
190~DV5~L6~Variable Value~Linear Projection Function~…if the true systematic reporting behavior function is the linear projection function, then the correlation coefficients presented in Bound and Krueger (1991) are an excellent summary of the relationship between the response and the true income.
190~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~Reporting Accuracy by Gender~…comparison of the estimate for men and women support that women are better reporters than men; the error is higher for men than women at all income levels, and the response of reported earnings to changes in actual earnings is flatter for men than for women.
190~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Expected Value of CPS Corresponding to SSE~…the null hypothesis that the expected value of the Current Population Survey observation relative to the Social Security Administration observation is equal to the Social Security Administration observation is tested for both samples using a test proposed by Lee (1994) comparing the sum of squared residuals from the nonparametric specification with the nonparametric estimate.
190~D1~F9~Findings~Null Hypothesis of Expected CPS Observations Relative to Social Security Administration Observations~…the null hypothesis that the expected value of the Current Population Survey observation relative to the Social Security Administration observation is equal to the Social Security Administration observation was rejected for men, but not for women, with the value of the test for men being equal to -2.94, and -0.69 for women; under the alternative hypothesis, the test must be negative, hence, a one-sided critical value is utilized reaching a p-value for the men equal to 0.0016, while for the women it is 0.2451.
190~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…these models may fail to capture the important nonlinearity in the relationships between the survey response and the true income.

190~D1, D2, D3~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…this specification was tested using the test proposed by Lee (1994), which tests the null hypothesis that the expected value of the Current Population Survey relative to the Social Security Administration observation.
190~D1, D2, d3~F10~Findings~OLS Estimation for Null Hypothesis Rejection by Gender~…ordinary least squares estimation resulted in a slope of 0.91 and an intercept of 1,364 for men, while for women, the slope is 0.97, and the intercept is 211; the test value for the men was -2.52, while the test value for the women was -0.51, and the respective p-values were 0.0059 and 0.3050 suggesting that the null hypothesis was rejected for the sample of men, but not rejected for the sample of women.
190~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~OLS Estimation for Null Hypothesis Rejection by Gender w/o Low Income Men~…retesting the hypothesis with ordinary least squares estimation excluding men with Social Security Administration income below $3,000, the null hypothesis that the specification is linear is no longer rejected with the resulting test statistics equal to -1.15, with a p-value of 0.1251.

190~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~Implications of OLS Results~…results imply that while a linear fit may work well for some range of the data, it would fail, at least for the men, to account for nonlinearity in the lowest ranges of the Social Security Administration earnings data.
190~D1~F13~Findings~Earnings as a Dependent Variable ~…in cases where earnings is the dependent variable, the response of men's earnings to variables such as education has a larger downward bias than women's earnings, with the differences in average overreporting resulting in an upward bias for a dummy variable representing male gender.
190~D1~F14~Findings~Earnings as an Independent Variable~…in the case where earnings is a regressor, the response of the dependent variable, such as savings, to earnings also has a larger downward bias for men than women.
190~D1~V3~Variable~Savings~…one dependent variable of interest in the case where earnings is a regressor.
190~D1, D2, D3~V4~Variable~Age~…an explanatory variable included in regressions that the inclusion of which may be argued to have led to systematic bias.

190~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Tobit~…a maximum-likelihood estimatioon of a Tobit model used in Bound and Krueger (1991) to address the issue that explanatory regressors may be the cause behind systematic bias, used in the current research to address whether these variables cause a different response structure controlling for income.
190~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Tobit~…presented as level curves in some specifications  generated by fixing values of Age (39), Education (12) and Weeks Worked (50) near their mean values.
190~D1~F15~Findings~Social Security Administration and Current Population Survey Earnings Relationship and Other Explanatory Variables~…for both men and women, it is evident that the relationship between Social Security Administration earnings and Current Population Survey earnings is not affected by other explanatory variables.

190~D1, D2, D3~F16~Findings~Assymetry by Gender and Income Level~…assymetry is most pronounced for men at low incomes and is postively skewed toward overreporting most notably in that the upper decile for men is very high for low Social Security Administration earnings and at higher earnings, the overreporting is less pronounced and the lower decile demonstrates a tendency for large underreporting of earnings; these findings substantiate those of Bound and Krueger (1991) and findings in the current research from previous subsections that a regression to the mean exists for men. However, from the quantile analysis, it is learned that this result is primarily generated by a subpopulation of individuals (about 10%), rather than a population-wide phenomenon.

190~D1, D2, D3~F18~Findings~Conditional Probability of Correctly Reporting Income Levels Estimates~…the results of estimation of the conditional probability of correctly reporting income levels show no relationship between the probability of correctly reporting income and the level of true income; this observation is also supported when the definition of accurate reporting is broadened to include responses within 5% of the mean income.
190~D1, D2, D3~F19~Findings~Panel Sample Construction and Measurement Error~…one major finding in this research demonstrates that the additional consistency checks of constructing a panel sample from the Current Population Survey result in lower overall measurement error in income, which may indicate that inability to follow individuals is related to response error, and hence, differences in regression results between cross-sectional and panel samples may be due to differences in response error.
190~D1~F20~Findings~Median Wage Regressions and Response Error~…one major finding in this research, reached by examining median and quantile regressions, is that since the median of the response error is not related to income or gender, median wage regressions will be less affected by response error.
190~D1, D2, D3~F21~Findings~Severe Bias and Mean-Tested Transfer Program Eligible Samples~…one major finding in this research, reached by examining median and quantile regressions, is that severe bias is likely to result in construction of samples of individuals who are eligible for means-tested transfer programs.
190~D1, D2, D3~~Derived Variable~Structural Measurement Error~…since the response error is asymmetric, with the largest errors occuring for low-income males, a sample constructed using an income threshold will contain too few males at the very lowest income levels, possibly significantly affecting predictions.

191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…in this paper, researchers show that in the presence of auxiliary data obeying a key assumption, researchers can consistently estimate the parameters of interest while allowing for arbitrary correlation between the measurement errors and other variables. Researchers also allow for non-linearity and non-smoothness in the moment conditions and show how one can obtain more efficient estimators using auxiliary data.

191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…the auxiliary data used in the empirical illustration section comes from validating the social security income for a subset of the primary sample respondents who reported their social security numbers.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…the crucial assumption that is maintained in the classical measurment error model is the independence (or uncorrelatedness) between the measurement error and the true (but unobserved) variable. Researchers relax this assumption by allowing arbitrary correlation between the measurement error and the true data.

191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…to solve the identification problem researchers require the presence of an auxiliary data-set which is used to estimate the parameter of interest. In this paper researchers use auxiliary data to mean a random sample of mismeasured and true variables which may or may not come from the same distriburtion as the primary data. In the case where the additional data are randomly sampled from the population, the auxiliary data-set becomes a validation data-set. More importantly, the auxiliary data can also be a random sample of variables where the marginal distribution of the conditional variable in the auxiliary data is different from the marginal distribution of the conditional variable in the primary sample.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…in quantile regressions researchers allow for measurement error in the dependent variable; this measurement error can be correlated with the regressors.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…researchers use a semiparametric sieve based estimator of their parameter of interst that combines the information in the auxiliary data and the primay data. This estimator is formulated using the identifying assumption that the conditional distribution of the variable in the auxiliary sample is the same of that in the primary sample. The intuition of the estimator is simple. The auxiliary data allows us to obtain the conditional relationship between the true but unobserved variables and the observed and mismeasured variables. This relationship is then used with the primary data to estimate the parameters of interest. hence, with an auxiliary data-set, once can learn about the relationship between the ture variables and thier mismeasured counterpart and use this relationship to back out the parameter of interst using the primary data-set. The estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under a set of regularity conditions.
191~D1~M3~Methodology~Sieve Least Squares Estimator~…researchers use a semiparametric sieve based estimator of their parameter of interst that combines the information in the auxiliary data and the primay data.

191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…the sieve based method avoids making the tedious trimming arguments that are typically made with kernel based methods. Using kernel methods to approximate conditional expectations in the current setting would require strong tail assumptions on the distribution of the mismeasured variables to guard against small values for the density.

191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…researchers present an empirical illustration that uses a data-set from the Current Population Survey/social security match data to explore the returns to schooling under general measurement error in earnings.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…in the 1978 March rotation of the CPS, respondents were asked for their social security number in addition to other questions including earnings.

191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…the current research allows for a general measurement error model that allows arbitrary correlation between the observed and the true variables while relaxing the requirement of validation data by allowing for stratification. Moreover, the current framework handles non-linear models with possibly non-smooth functions.
191~D1~M2~Methodology~Censored LAD~…the current research allows for a general measurement error model that allows arbitrary correlation between the observed and the true variables while relaxing the requirement of validation data by allowing for stratification. Moreover, the current framework handles non-linear models with possibly non-smooth functions.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…Caroll and Wand (1991), Sepanski and Carroll (1993) and Lee and Sepanski (1995) consider non-linear least squares problems where the measurement error is only in the regressors. The current general class of moment based models nests theirs but also contains for example the class of best predictor problems with measurement error and response. This, for example, allows one to study (possibly censored) quantile regression with measurement error in the dependent variable as well as in the regressors, something that the above-mentioned papers cannot handle. In fact, the current researchers' set-up nests theirs in a similar way that generalized method of moments nests least squares.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…the results in these papers generally fail if the auxiliary data are obtained by stratified sampling.

The motivation of Assumption 1 is statistical in nature and should relate to the nature of the measurement error available in the data. Nevertheless, there is a link between this assumption and the identifying assumption (the so-called ""strong ignorability condition"" or the ""selection on observables"" condition) typically made for matching estimators in the program evaluation literature. There, conditional on a set of observed covariates, the researcher is interested in identifying the counterfactual untreated distribution of the treated group should they have not been treated. The ""strong ignorability condition assumes that this is equal to the observed outcome distribution of the untreated group. Hence, by using Assumption 1, one can replace the projection of the counterfactual (unobserved) outcome distribution in the treated group by the projection of the (observed) outcome distribution in the untreated group and then average over the regressors.

191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~...It is important to note that Assumption 1 is satisfied in the stratified sampling desing where a non-random response based subsample of the primary data is validated. In a typical example of this stratified sampling design, researchers first oversample a certain subpopulation of the mismeasured variables X, and then validate the true variables X* corersponding to this non-random stratified subsample of X. It is very natural and sensible to oversample a subpopulation of the primary data-set where more severe measurement error is suspected to be present. Assumption 1 is valid as long as, in this sampling procedure of the auxiliary data-set, the sampling scheme of X(v) is based only on information available in the distribution of the primary data-set. The stratified sample is obtained by validating every observation for which the probability of a random observation is less than the probability of validating an observation after the variable is observed.

Assumption 3(1) is a standard weighted smoothness condition imposed on the function g(., [beta]). Assumption 3(2) is a typical condition on the tail behaviour of the marginal densities. Assumption 3(3) and 3(4) are sufficient conditions to ensure consistency of the method of moments estimator of the parameter of interest when the funciton form of the moment is known.

191~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~g(., [beta])~…to estimate the unknown function g(., [beta]) well by the sieve estimator g(., [beta)] researchers need to assume that g(x, [beta]) is smooth in some sense with respect to x(c), the vector of continuous elements of x.

191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…to illustrate the researchers methods empirically, researchers use a data-set that matches the Current Population Survey (CPS) to employer-reported social security earnings (SSR) from 1978 (the CPS/SSR Exact Match File).
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…individuals in the CPS were asked about their social security numbers. For those who provided the number, their earnings were matched against the social security records.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…income in the CPS data-set is measured making the implementation of a standard Mincer regression to compute returns to education and experience useless.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…a complication arises due to the top-coding (censoring) of the social security earnings.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…the estimator presented in this research will not only correct for the measurement error in income in a returns to schooling regression, but will also deal with the top coding issue by using a censoring robust estimator.
191~D1~M2~Methodology~Censored LAD~…the estimator presented in this research will not only correct for the measurement error in income in a returns to schooling regression, but will also deal with the top coding issue by using a censoring robust estimator.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…a maintained assumption is that social security earnings data are more accurate than the household reported earnings data (CPS). Hence earnings from the social security records (SSR) are treated as the auxiliary data.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…researchers eliminate observations where the respondent has been working for less than a year or is working in occupations that are likely to have unreported tips like bartenders, waiters, or taxicab drivers.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…an issue that arises is that individuals that provided their social security number might be a selected group. In order to identify this issue, researchers present a table that compares the observable characteristics of the matched and non-matched respondents. It is seen that the observable characteristics of both respondents are similar.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…another shortcoming of the SSR data is that earnings are capped at the social security maximum of $16,500. This map into a censoring level of 40% for males and about 4% for females. To reduce the effect of sample selection that would arise using the female samples, researchers use the male sample and restrict it to individual between the ages of 40 and 50 (for computational simplicity) and use censored least absolute deviation estimators to deal with censoring. The number of observations in the primary sample is n(p) = 7362 and in the validation sample is n(v) = 4809.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…in providing evidence against the classical measurement error model, researchers divide the data into the lowest quartile (based on SSR) and call that Low_SSR in the figure, the 25-th-75-th range (Median_SSR in the figure) and the top quartile (High_SSR) and graph the density of the measurement error (CPS-SSR) for matched individuals whose SSR income is below the topcode of $16,500.
191~D1~V1~Variable~Earnings~…in providing evidence against the classical measurement error model, researchers divide the data into the lowest quartile (based on SSR) and call that Low_SSR in the figure, the 25-th-75-th range (Median_SSR in the figure) and the top quartile (High_SSR) and graph the density of the measurement error (CPS-SSR) for matched individuals whose SSR income is below the topcode of $16,500. The measurement error (SSR-CPS) can be as small as -$45,000. The reason for this is that, for individuals whose SSR income is less than the topcode, their CPS income (or reported income) can be high. The median SSR income below the the topcode is $10,034 while the median CPS income for individuals whose SSR is below the topcode is $19,000.
191~V1~L1~Variable Value~Low_SSR~…the median SSR income in the Low_SSR earnings group is $4578.
191~V1~L2~Variable Value~Median_SSR~…the median SSR income in the Median_SSR group is $10,012.
191~V1~L3~Variable Value~High_SSR~…the median in the High_SSR group is $15,316.
191~D1~V1~Variable~Earnings~…the error densities are different for different income levels. In particular, low income individuals (based on their SSR income) tend to overreport their income. The measurement error (SSR-CPS) can be as small as -$45,000. The reason for this is that, for individuals whose SSR income is less than the topcode, their CPS income (or reported income) can be high. The median SSR income below the the topcode is $10,034 while the median CPS income for individuals whose SSR is below the topcode is $19,000.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…a Mincer regression studies the log income level logY(p)* as a function of Z(p), a set of regressors that include education and experience. Researchers, instead, use a quantile based censored least absolute deviation model (CLAD) where they correct for measurement error of unkown form using methods developed in this paper.  Moreover, by restricting themselves to older males, they minimize the sample selection problem. To map the problem back into the framework which is based on method of moments (rather than M-estimation) one can take the first order conditions of the CLAD objective function. However, it is well known that the moment conditions based on the first order conditions are set equal to zero not only by the true parameter value, but also by other parameters (like zero) which creates problems of local minima when using method of moments as a basis for inference. To remedy this, researchers base their inference on the objective function and adapt this approach above to it.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…given that researchers only observe logY* in the validation data, and assuming that the regressors (Z = education, experience, experience squared, and race) are measured without error, the modified objective function that is obtained by projecting the unobserved function on the the primary data is used where the equality follows from the main Assumption 1.
191~D1~V2~Variable~Education~…education as a regressor of interest in the current research.
191~D1~V3~Variable~Experience~…experience as a regressor of interest in the current research.

191~D1~M3~Methodology~Sieve Least Squares Estimator~…a tensor product polynomial spline sieve in the empirical application. In particular, researchers used second order polynomial splines with K knots as the sieve basis to approximate square integrable functions. The race dummy is interacted with all the polynomial spline base functions.
191~D1~M2~Methodology~Censored LAD~…the first results column provides estimates using the censored LAD model on the auxiliary. The estimator here is the median censored regression estimator of Powell (1984) which is consistent in the absence of stratification.
191~D1~M2~Methodology~Censored LAD~…the second results column provides LAD estimates from the primary sample. Here the dependent variable is the log of reported income and is in general inconsistent in the presence of measurement error.
191~D1~M1~Methodology~Quantile~…the third results column reports estimates that are obtained using the mincer estimator. The standard errors for the third column estimator were obtained using formulas derived in Appendix C.

191~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Returns to Experience~…the earnings differentials attributed to one additional year of experience, as estimated by Quantile and Censored LAD regressions.
191~D1~F1~Findings~Returns to Schooling Estimation Results~…estimates show that the returns to schooling coefficient is stable around 5.5% for the first and third estimator with the mincer equation having the highest standard error which is to be expected. The returns to schooling using LAD (second column) on the primary data is higher (at almost 7%).
191~D1~M3~Methodology~Sieve Least Squares Estimator~…one safe rule is that spline sieve is always better than power series. Also, in the semiparametric sieve set-up one can still use the same number of sieve terms as suggested by GCV in the purely non parametric regressions.
191~D1~F2~Findings~Returns to Experience Estimation Results~…it is interesting to note that the retuns to experience is negative and insignificant for both the auxiliary estimator and the researchers' estimator, while the estimator using the primary data is positive and significant. Under their assumptions, this estimator is inconsistent. It is suspected that the reason for the insignificance of the experience coefficient is that the effect of experience in the population of males above 40 years of age might not be important.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…to allow for arbitrary correlation between the true variable and the measurement error, researchers use auxiliary data that identify the conditional distribution of the true variables given the mismeasured variables. This assumption is satisfied if the auxiliary data-set is a validated stratified subsample of the primary data-set, or if it is a validation data-set that ids drawn from the population.
191~D1~M3~Methodology~Sieve Least Squares Estimator~…under the identification conditions, researchers provide a semiparametric sieve based estimator that exploits the information in both data-sets and shows that this estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.
191~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS/SSR 1979~…researchers illustrate the estimator of interest using data from the CPS/SSR exact data match where it is shown how the estimator can be used in the presence of censoring.

192~D1~D1~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…data on factor shares are mainly used to describe the functional distribution of income and test models of income distrbution, to indirectly estimate parameters of an aggregate production function, to infer the division of rents between workers and firms and to forecast tax revenues.
192~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor's Share~…superficially, labor's share is straightfoward to measure: divide total compensation of workers by national income, however this measurement ignores the questions of who is a worker?, should CEO's and business owners be included?, what is included in compensation?, should the corporate officers' stock options count as labor earnings?, is the return to investment in human capital counted as labor or capital income?, and how should retired workers who receive continuing health insurance coverage be treated?, answers to which differ depending on the intended use of factor shares.
192~D2~D2~Dataset~EOS-202~…the main source of income data in the national accounts is employer-reported payroll data from the state Unemployment Insurance payroll systems, called ES-202 data.

192~DV2~L1~Variable Value~Unincorporated Business Owner Earnings~…it is unclear how the income of proprietors should be categorized in the labor-capital dichotomy, because some of the income earned by self-employed workers celarly represents labor income, while some represents a return on investment or economic profit.

192~DV2~L1~Variable Value~Unincorporated Business Owner Earnings~…the national accounts rely on arbitrary legal definitions to classify income of business owners as follows: if two doctors are partners in an unincorporated medical practice, for example, their income is counted as proprietors' income, but if the same doctors incorporate their business and draw a salary from their corporation (which is likely, given the tax advantages), their income would be counted as employee compensation.

192~D1, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~National Income~…because the function of the corporate officers is different than the function of the other employees, a problem inherently arises because income is forced into two artificial categories, labor and nonlabor income.
192~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~National Income~…the accounting concept used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to calculate national income is accruals for wage and slary income and disbursements for other labor income.
192~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~National Income~…although there may be some advantages in counting employers' nonwage contributions when they occur, as opposed to when they are promised or earned, there are also disadvantages.

192~DV1~L6~Variable Value~Labor's Share IV~…represented in figures by lines of triangles.
192~Dv1~L3~Variable Value~Labor's Share I~…the run-up in non-wage compensation was due in roughly equal measure to required social-insurance contributions and voluntary fringe benefits; because labor probably bears the incidence of these payments, the reseacher has a preference for using the broader-gauged total compensation to measure labor's share and refers to total labor compensation plus two-thirds of proprietor's income relative to national income as labor's share for the bulk analysis of this paper.
192~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Labor's Share and Adult Male Unemployment Rate Correlation~…the correlation between labor's share and the adult male unemployment rate is 0.34.
192~D1~D1~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…the divergent trends in the various wage series documented by Katharine Abraham et al. (1999) is a cause of concern for measuring labor's share because the hourly wage series derived from the National Income and Product Accounts data shows significantly faster growth than all other available series.
192~D1~D1~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…external literature from Abraham et al. (1999) find that half of the divergence between earnings from the Current Population Survey and this data between 1973 and 1997 is due to differential hours growth, and half is due to differential growth in total payroll; in turn, if National Income Product Accounts data overstate the growth in payroll, then labor's share is overstated as well.
192~D3~D3~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…external literature from Abraham et al. (1999) find that half of the divergence between earnings from the Current Population Survey and this data between 1973 and 1997 is due to differential hours growth, and half is due to differential growth in total payroll.
192~~~Time Period~1973-1997~…survey period from which half of the divergence between earnings from the Current Population Survey and National Income Products data is due to differential hours growth, and half is due to differential growth in total payroll.

192~D4~D4~Dataset~Employment Cost Index Survey~…the employment cost index is estimated from a quarterly survey of 23,000 jobs within 4,400 private-sector firms.
192~D4~D4~Dataset~Employment Cost Index Survey~…although the employment cost index is a fixed-payroll-weighted compensation inde, average Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data are calculated each year from the underlying ECI data using current employment weights.
192~D4~D4~Dataset~Employment Cost Index Survey~…average Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data are calculated each year from the underlying Employment Cost Index data using current employment weights.
192~D4~D4~Dataset~Employment Cost Index Survey~…external literature from Anthony Barkume and Michael Lettau (1998) calculated an experimental wage series from Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data using current hours as weights, representing wage and alary per hour; Lettau provided the researcher with the underlying data series for total compensation per hour worked derived from the Employment Cost Index Survey.
192~D4~D4~Dataset~Employment Cost Index Survey~…in terms of breadth of compensation covered, the experiemental wage series from Barkume and Lettau (1998) is probably the best alternative series to compare to the National Income and Product Accounts compensation-per-hour series.

192~D1, D2, D4~F4~Findings~ECI data and ES-202 Payroll Pickup/NIPA Implications~…the Employment Cost Index data picked up 97% of the ES-202 payroll in 1988, but only 88% in 1995, results that suggest that either the National Income and Product Accounts wage and salary data have grown too quickly in the 1990's or aggregate wage and salary data derived from the Employment Cost Index have grown too slowly.
192~D1, D2, D4~~Time Period~1988-1998~…relevant period for labor share analysis across data sets.
192~D1~D1~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~…it is worth noting that National Income and Product Accounts wage and salary data grew 4% faster than the Intenal Revenue Service's payroll figures between 1984 and 1996 (see Thae Park, 1998).
192~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Adjusted Labor's Share (numerator and denominator)~…supposes that the National Income and Product Accounts wage and salary data have grown too rapidly because ES-202 data increasingly double-count some fringe benefits as wage and salary income; in this case, labor income and national income have grown too rapidly.

192~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Adjusted Labor's Share (numerator only)~…supposes that the Employment Cost Index data and the National Income and Product Accounts data diverged because the National Income and Product Accounts data include some business owner's income in labor compenstion; in this case, only the numerator of labor's share should be adjusted.
192~D1, D2, D4~F6~Findings~Adjusted Labor's Share (numerator only) Results~…when estimating the adjusted labor's share by deflating only the numerator, the results indicate a substantial 5.6-point fall in labor's share since 1988.

192~D3, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Implied Total Value of Raw Labor~…an estimated measure of the implied total value of raw labor in the United States economy; to allocate proprietor's income, the researcher assumes that two-thirds of proprietor's income is labor income and then assigned a proportion of that income to raw labor.
192~D3, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Implied Total Value of Raw Labor~…the researcher makes the tenuous assumption that nonwage compensation is divided between raw labor and human capital in the same ratio as wages.
192~D3, D5~F8~Findings~Raw Labor Total Compensation and Residual Human-Capital Compensation~…in 1996, raw labor earned an estimated $300 billion in total compensation, with the residual human-capital compensation equal to nearly $4.5 trillion.
192~D3, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Human Capital's Share~…changes in human capital's share can be decomposed into a component due to changes in education and experience and a component due to changes in the rewards to those characteristics.
192~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F9~Findings~Raw Labor's Share of National Income~…raw labor's share of national income declined since 1979, which is not surprising in view of the well-documented rise in the return to education and experience in this period.

193~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Price-Cost Margins~…high price-cost margins are not due to lack of price competition, but are due to consumers' willingness to pay for their favorite brand, and pricing decisions by firms that take into account substitution between their own brands.
193~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Price-Cost Margins~…to the extent that there is any market power in the industry, it is due to the firm's ability to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence perceived product quality through advertising that leads to higher price-cost margins.

193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~…restricts consumers to substitute towards other brands in proportion to market shares, regardless of characteristics.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Full~…the full model, as opposed to less restrictive Nested Logit and Principles of Differentiation Generalized Extreme Value models, allows for flexible own-price elasticities and allows cross-price substitution patters to be driven down by product characteristics.

193~D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Product Characteristics~…treating the characteristics as predetermined, rather than reacting to demand shocks, is a reasonable method of treating endogeneity.
193~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Price~…prices of a particular brand in two cities will be correlated due to the common marginal cost, but due to the independence assumption will be uncorrelated with market specific valuation.

193~D1, D2, D4~V6~Variable~Brand Specific Dummy Variables~…introducing these brand fixed effects increases the number of parameters only with number of brands and not the number of brands squared.
193~D1, D4~DV5~Dummy Variable~Consumer Taste~…in order to retrieve the taste coefficients, when brand fixed-effects are included, the reseracher regresses the estimated brand effects on the product charcteristics, as in a minimum-distance procedure proposed by Chamberlain (1982).
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the Logit model yields restrictive and unrealistic substituion patterns, and therefore is inadequate for measuring karket power; however, due to its computational simplicity it is a useful tool in getting a feel for the data.

193~D1, D3~F6~Findings~Advertising and Price Elasticity~…once the researcher controls for potential endogeneity, the mean elasticity with respect to advertising is approximately 0.06.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~F7~Findings~Logit Regression Specification~…the important thing to take from these logit results is the similarity between estimates using the two sets of instrumental variables, and the importance of controlling for demographics and heterogeneity.
193~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Predicted Market Share~…computed using current estimated market share and is based on the empirical distribution of demographics.
193~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in order to calculate the empirical distribution of demographics, the researcher sampled 40 individuals for each year, in total 200 for each city.
193~D4~F8~Findings~Sogginess Valuation~…most of the consumers in the sample value sogginess in a negative way, but approximately 15% of consumers actually prefer a mush cereal.
193~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Demographics and Heterogeneity~…coefficients with price on demographics are statistically significant, while the estimate of the standard deviation is not, suggesting that most of the heterogeneity is explained by the demographics.
193~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Age, Wealth, and Price Elasticity~…older and above-average income consumers tend to be less price sensitive in their cereal consumption patterns according to the estimated results in the full model.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Full~…includes 1,124 markets in the sample.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Full~…an additional diagnostic of how far the results are from the restrictive form imposed by the logit model is given by examining the variation in the cross-price elasticities in each column by examining the ratio of the maximum to the minimum cross-price elasticity, within a single column.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the logit model implies that all cross-price elasticities within a column are equal and therefore have a ratio of one.
193~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Ratio of Cross-Price Elasticities by Brand~…the ratio of the maximum to the minimum cross-price elasticities varies from 21 (Corn Flakes) to 3.5 (Shredded Wheat), with 95% confidence intervals of 11 to 260 and 3 to 52 respectively; this suggests that the results have overcome the Logit restrictions, but more importantly for which brands the characteristics do not seem strong enough to overcome the restictions testing which characterstics the researcher might want to add..
193~D1~V7~Variable~Outside Good~…all generic products are included in the outside good and therefore it should not be surprising that the outside good is more sensitive to the price of the inside good.
193~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~Market Share and Outside Good Sensitivity~…the cross-price elasticity for outside goods is higher for Kellogg's Corn Flakes than Froot Loops in absolute terms and as a ratio of the average cross-price elasticity, suggesting the relative importance of the outside good to each brand; this is also possibly attributed to the fact that generic versions of Kellog's Corn Flakes have higher market shares than generic versions of Froot Loops as supported in the data.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~…for the logit model we can use the estimates to compute the predicted price-scost margins for brands theat were not included in the estimation using the prece sensitivity and the market shares of additional brands.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Full~…in the full model we need more information about additional products, not just their market share, and therefore cannot impute the price-cost margins.
193~D1~V1~Variable~Industry Structure~…in order to determine which model of conduct fits the industry, the price-cost margins must be compared assuming different models of conduct to actual margins.
193~DV1~L11~Variable Value~Gross Retail Margin~…does not include promotional costs, some of which can be argued to be marginal costs.
193~DV1~L11~Variable Value~Gross Retail Margin~…the relative comparison estimate is the gross retail margin, estimated at 46.0%
193~D1, D2, D4~DV1~Derived Variable~Price-Cost Margins~…the accounting estimates of marginal costs and the implied margins are a crude estimate for the typical brand, however the predicted price-cost margins by the different models are different enough that the crude measure can still be used to separate the different effects.
193~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Null Rejection for Collusion~...using confidence intervals the null hypothesis can be rejected that either the typical margins, or the bounds, are equal to those predicted by the model of joint profit maximization for the 25 brands.
193~V1~L1~Variable Value~Single-Product Firms~…it is more probable that the smaller brands, not included in the sample, have a higher, in absolute value, own-price elasticity (relative to similar brands that are in this sample, and therefore the price-cost margins predicted by the single-firm model will go down, an effect that will be offset if observations are weighted by market shares.
193~V1~L2~Variable Value~Current Structure~…including more products in the inside goods rather than the outside good will tend to increase the price-cost margins, i.e. the more products included, the larger the effect.
193~V1~L3~Variable Value~Monopoly~…including more products in the inside goods rather than the outside good will tend to increase the price-cost margins, i.e. the more products included, the larger the effect, suggesting that in this fully collusive model, the effects will be larger.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~…this paper uses a random coefficients discrete choice mixed logit model to estimate a brand-level demand system for ready-to-eat cereal.
193~D1~D1~Dataset~University of Connecticut Infoscan Database~…demand parameter identification is used to exploit the panel structure of the data.
193~D1, D2, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Demand Function~…demand parameter identification is based on an independence assumption of demand shocks across cities for each brand.
193~D1, D2, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Demand Function~…the resulting estimated elasticities are used to compute price cost margins that would prevail under three different conduct models.
193~D1, D2, D3, D4~F14~Findings~High Price-Cost Margins and Collusion~…even with price-cost margins greater than 45%, prices in the industry are not a result of collusive behavior, ruling out an extreme version of cooperative pricing in which all firms jointly maximize profits; however it is important to note that the estimated results in this paper do not rule out cooperative pricing between a subset of products or producers.
193~D1~D1~Dataset~University of Connecticut Infoscan Database~…quantity and price data were obtained from the Food Marketing Policy Center at the University of Connecticut collected by Information Resources, Inc., a marketing firm in Chicago, using scanning devices in a national random sample of supermarkets located in various metropolitan areas and rural towns; weekly data for UPC-coded products are drawn from a sample which represents the universe of supermarkets with annual sales of more than $2 million dollars, accounting for 82% of grocery sales in the United States, a sample covering more than 20% of the relevant population in most United States cities.
193~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Market Share~…defined by converting volume sales into number of servings sold, and dividing by the total potential number of servings in a city in a quarter.
193~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Market Share~"…converting volumve sales into number of servings sold was done by using the serving weight suggested by the manufacturer, a method which is at least proportional to the ""true"" serving weight."
193~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Market Share~…the market share of the outside good was defined as the difference betweee one tand the sum of the inside goods market shares.
193~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Price~…a price variable was created by dividing the dollar sales by the number of servings sold, and was deflated using a regional urban consumer price index.
193~D3~D3~Dataset~Leading National Advertising ~…contains quarterly national advertising expenditures by brand collected from 10 media sources including magazines, Sunday magazines, newspapers, outdoor, network television, spot television, syndicated television, cable networks, network radio, and national spot radio.
193~D4~D4~Dataset~Field Test~…data collected in 1988 through examining cereal boxes at local supermarkets.
193~D4~D4~Dataset~Field Test~…researcher utilizes this data implicitly assuming that characteristics have not changed since 1988.
193~D4~T2~Time Period~1988.0~…year in which all product characteristic information was gathered through field tests examining cereal boxes at local supermarkets
193~D4~DV3~Derived Variable~Product Characteristics~…collected through examining cereal boxes at local supermarkets, implicitly assuming that characterstics have not changed since 1988.
193~DV3~L12~Variable Value~Mushy~"…each cereal was classified into ""mushy"" or not, depending on its sogginess in milk."
193~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Income~…for individual was calculated by dividing household income by the size of the household.

195~195: Migration of Recent College Graduates: Evidence from the National Longitduinal Survey of Youth~~~~
195~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…this study is a first step in providing evidence on the factors influencing location decisions of recent graduates, making use of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth from 1979 to 1996 to examine cross-state migration in the five-year period after completion of schooling.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…to track migration patterns, this study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a project of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY is based on a nationally representative sample of about 6,000 persons who were 14 to 22 years old in 1979. These youngs and young adults were reinterviewed once a year until 1994 and once every other year thereafter. The final year of data available for this study is 1996, when the interviewees were 31 to 39 years old.
195~D1~T1~Time Period~1979-1996~…survey period from which National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data is available for the current research.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…given that the NLSY is a general-purpose survey intended to be representative of an entire cohort, the experiences of sample members varied widely. For example, some members of the sample did not complete even high school, while others completed not only high school, but various levels of higher education. Some individuals in the NLSY remained in the same state throughout their lives, while others showed considerable geographic mobility.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…this data source pertains to fewer individuals than some other data sets containing migration information, so the data from the samplemay reflect actual national figures with a greater margin of error. However, in contrast to other surveys, the NLSY has the advantage of tracking residential location over a long time interval.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY indicates the state in which respondents were residing at birth, at age 14, and in each year of the survey.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…many of those surveyed in the NLSY made long-distance moves at some point in their lives. According to the top panel, 38.9% of all sample members were in a different state in 1996 than at birth, and 25.5% were in a different state than when they were first observed in 1979. The middle panel indicates migration to a noncontiguous state, and the bottom panel indicates migration to another Census division. Depending on the specific time period, about two-thirds to three-quarters of interstate moves were to a noncontiguous state or to a different Census division.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the full NLSY includes two additional samples focusing on minorities and the economically disadvantaged and military personnel. These subsamples were not used in the current study.
195~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…annual supplements to the Current Population Survye (CPS) provide information on moves since the previous year for a total of about 50,000 to 60,000 households. Because of the methods used to rotate households in and out of the survey, migration patters for many of these households can actually be observed over a two-year time frame. Even so, the information tends to be less useful for college students and recent colege graduates than for most other adults. This is because the CPS refers to permanent residence, which may differ from residence while attending school or while in a temporary job.
195~D3~D3~Dataest~Census~…the decennial Censuses indicate change in location for the entire population; public use files provide randomly drawn samples from the full data set. The latest available data com from the 1990 Census, referring to moves between 1985 and 1990.

195~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Percent Moving per Period~…equal to the number of changes in location between consecutive time periods divided by the total number of time periods. The sixteen time periods are as follows: annually between 1979-1980 and 1993-1994, and 1994 to 1996. Missing location entries were assigned the last known location.
195~D1~T1~Time Period~1979-1996~…the sixteen time periods used in computing the perecent moving per period are as follows: annually between 1979-80 and 1993-94, and 1994 to 1996.
195~D1~F3~Findings~Any Given Year State Moves for HS- vs. College Graduates Over the Relevant Period~…for high school graduates, on average 5.3% moved to a different state in any given year; for those completing four years of college, the rate was 8.7%, and for those with more than four years of college, the rate was 10.2%. The average frequency of moves for those completing less than four years of college was more similar to that of high school graduates than to that of those completing four years of college.
195~D1~V4~Variable~Educational Attainment~…the level of education completed in 1996 used in order to analyze migration trend differences based on educational attainment.

195~V4~L20~Variable Value~More Than College~…one of five educational categories indicating that an NLSY respondent completed more than college.
195~D1~F4~Findings~One-Year Post-Graduation HS State Changes Over the Relevant Period~…one year after college graduation, just over 30% of graduates were living in a state other than where they attended high school. This proportion rose to about 40% by year six, but then stayed roughly unchanged through year 10.
195~D1~F5~Findings~One-Year Post-Graduation College State Changes Over the Relevant Period~…one year after college graduation, only about 15% of college graduates were living in a different state from where they attended college. This share rose to about 30% by year five and to about 38% by year nine before tapering off.
195~D1~F6~Findings~One-Year Post-HS Graduation State Moves Over the Relevant Period~…for non-college graduates, only 15% changed states within five years of high school graduation. This proportion remained less than 20% in year 10.
195~D1~V4~Variable~Educational Attainment~…the relevant analaysis collapses educational attainment into two categories. High school drop outs are omitted from further analysis.

195~DV3~L24~Variable Value~College Graduate Out-Migration Rates~"…the numerator for each entry in the ""out-migration"" column refers to the number of persons who graduated from college in the location indicated but were no longer in the same Census division fgive years later."
195~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~College Graduate 5-Year Migration Rates Across Census Divisions~…the sample size differs between the top and bottom panels because one person graduated from college in the United States but graduated from high school outside the country. To be comparable with later calculations, the table omits people who were not in the labor force five years after college graduation.
195~D1~F7~Findings~Five-Year Post-Graduation Census Division Moves ~…within five years of graduation, 23.5% of the sample were living in a different Census division from the one where they completed high school and 19.8% were living in a different Census division from where they completed college.
195~DV3~L25~Variable Value~College Graduate Net Migration Rates~…because the data refer only to domestic migration, there is no difference between the aggregate numbers migrating in and migrating out: domestic net migration is zero for the nation.
195~DV3~L26~Variable Value~College Graduate Between State Migration Rates~…the out-migration rate including migration between states within Census divisions.
195~DV3~L27~Variable Value~College Graduate Between State and Nation Migration Rates~…the out-migration rate including migration between states and international boundaries.
195~D1~F8~Findings~Migration by Education and Census Division~…consider migration relative to the state of high school graduation. Migration of recent college graduates into the South Atlantic, Mountain, and Pacific divisions was far higher than the national average. These areas gained 33%, 69%, and 53% more college graduates through in-migration, respectively, relative to the numbers of college graduates who had finished high school there. In addition, the South Atlantic nd Pacicific, along with the Middle Atalantic and West South Central, saw below-average proportions of college graduates migrating out to other parts of the country. The outmigration rate for the Mountain states was above the nationwide rate of in-migratio. As a result, net in-migration rates were highest for the South Atlantic, Mountain, and Pacific divisions (between 14% and 42%).
195~D1, D3~F9~Findings~Census Divisions and College Graduate Outflows~"…judging by the NLSY, New England, the East and West North Central, and East South Central areas lost the highest shares of college graduates through domestic migration during this period (10% to 16%). These negative findings are not necessarily indicative of a ""brain drain"" for these areas, since they omit migration from foreign countries. The figures also omit other potential domestic sources of college graduates such as increases in the fraction of high school students from the region who obtain a college degree and inflows after the five-year period shown."
195~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~College Graduate 5-Year Migration Rates Across Census Divisions~…these figures omit migration from foreign countries and other potential domestic sources of college graduates, such as increases in the fraction of high school students from the region who obtain a college degree and inflows after five-year period shown.
195~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~High School Graduate 5-Year Migration Rates Across Census Divisions~…five year migration rates across Census divisions for high-school graduates from 1975 to 1991 for those not completing four years of college, drawn from the NLSY sample.

195~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~High School Graduate 5-Year Migration Rates Across Census Divisions~…shows migration rates in the five years following high school graduation for those who did not complete college, a total of about 2,2000 persons in the sample.
195~D1~F10~Findings~Net Migration for High School Graduates~…the respective high-school graduate rates of inflows and outflows for all areas are substantially lower than in the case of college graduates. This confirms that people without a college degree are less likely to move long distances than people with a college degree - even examining individual regions.
195~DV4~L30~Variable Value~High School Graduate Net-Migration Rates~…the net difference between five-year  in- and out-migration rates for high school graduates.

195~DV4~L32~Variable Value~High School Graduate Between State and Nation Migration Rates~…the analysis in the bulk of the study includes this most comprehensive definition of migration.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY data are used first to investigate which factors help to explain out-migration by recent graduates. Specifically, the regressions examine whether or not individuals had moved out of state by the fifth year following graduation from college or high school.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the NLSY data are used first to investigate which factors help to explain out-migration by recent graduates. Specifically, the regressions examine whether or not individuals had moved out of state by the fifth year following graduation from college or high school.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the potential explanatory variables included personal characteristics as well as the economic and quality-of-life characteristics of the origin state.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…in the initial specification, the dependent variable is equal to one if five years after college graduation the person was living in a state other than the one in which he or she graduated from high school. This regression refers to sample members with at least  four years of college.
195~D1~V5~Variable~Migrated From HS After College Graduation~…a dependent variable in initial regression specifications equal to one if five years after college gradation the person was living in a state other than the one in which he or she graduated from high school.
195~D1~V6~Variable~Migrated From College After College Graduation~…a dependent variable in secondary regression specifications equal to one if five years after college graduation the person was living in a state other than the one in which he or she graduated from college.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…in the secondary specification, the dependent variable is equal to one if five years after college graduation the person was living in a state other than the one in which he or she graduated from college. This regression refers to sample members with at least four years of college.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…in the third specification, the dependent variable is equal to one if five years after high school graduation the person was living in a state other than the one in which he or she graduated from high school. 
195~D1~V7~Variable~Migrated From HS After HS Graduation~…a dependent variable in the third regression specifications equal to one if five years after high school graduation the person was living in a state other than the one in which he or she graduated from high school.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the reported estimates were derived from a probit model. The reported significance levels are based on robust standard errors assuming independence of disturbances only across (not within) states.
195~D1~M1~Methodology~Probit~…individuals who were not in the civilian labor force five years after graduation (because they were students, in the military, or for other reasons) were excluded from the regressions. In practice, this restriction has little effect on the results, except for having the effect of diminishing differences in migration propensities across men and women.
195~D1~V8~Variable~Migrated Between Birth and High School~…a binary variable indicating that an individual moved between birth and high school as included in all probit regressions.
195~D1~V9~Variable~Migrated Between High School and College~…a binary variable indicating that an individual moved between high school and college as included in probit regressions concerning migration of college graduates only.

195~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…the unemployment rate as the difference from the national average; included in probit regressions.
195~D3~V12~Variable~State Population~…the state population as included in probit regressions.

195~D4~V14~Variable~Average Maximum Wind Speed~…the average maximum wind speed as included in probit regressions.
195~D4~V15~Variable~Average Number of Clear Days~…the average number of clear days as included in probit regressions.
195~D4~V16~Variable~Degree Days~…the number of degree days as included in probit regressions.
195~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College Graduate Pay Relative to National Average~…the college graduate pay relative to the national average as included in probit regressions.
195~D3~V17~Variable~State Land Area~…the state land are as included in probit regressions.
195~D1~F11~Findings~College Graduate Likelihood of Being Out-of-State Five Years Post-Graduation~…for college graduates, someone who had gone to college out-of-state was 54% more likely to be out-of-state five years after graduation than someone who went to college in-state.
195~D1~F12~Findings~College Graduate Likelihood of State Move Contingent on a Move Between Birth and HS~…for college graduates, someone who had moved across state lines between birth and high school was 17% more likely to change states again than someone who was in the same state at birth and high school graduation.
195~D3~V17~Variable~State Land Area~…the larger the state, the farther one could move without corssing a state boundary; therefore, interstae migration is expected to be negatively related to state size. However, this variable is insignificant.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Probit~…calculating the likelihood to be out-of-state five years after graduation for out-of-state college graduates vs. in-state college college graduates involves converting the coefficients shown in the table from their impacts on the probit index to their impacts on the probability, evaluated at the means of the other variables.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the pseudo R-squared values shown in the table are based on comparing the value of the log likelihood in each specification against two hypothetical alternatives: including only the constant term and achieving a perfic fit (log likelihood = 0). Therefore they cannot be interpreted as percent of variance explained, as in a linear regression. When the specifiation in column (1) is re-run using a linear probability model, the R-squared is 0.28.
195~D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Employment Growth Rate~…one of three indicators of employment opportunities in the high school state.
195~D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Employment Growth Rate~…averaged over five years, starting with the year of graduation.
195~D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rate~…one of three indicators of employment opportunities in the high school state.
195~D3~V12~Variable~State Population~…one of three indicators of employment opportunities in the high school state.
195~V1~L5~Variable Value~South Atlantic~…six of the ten states with the highest employment growth in the sample period are in the South Atlantic and Pacific Regions (Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Washington, Delaware, and North Carolina).
195~V1~L9~Variable Value~Pacific~…six of the ten states with the highest employment growth in the sample period are in the South Atlantic and Pacific Regions (Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Washington, Delaware, and North Carolina).
195~D3~V12~Variable~State Population~…state population is included as a reflection of the diversity of opportunity that large states offer.
195~V1~L8~Variable Value~Mountain~…this region experiences confluence of high employment growth and high out-migration in the Mountain states.
195~V1~L2~Variable Value~Middle Atlantic~…the Middle Atlantic states experienced low out-migration, even though their employment growth was quite low.
195~D1~V13~Variable~Dummy For Seacoast~…an amenity variable associated with location and weather.
195~D4~V14~Variable~Average Maximum Wind Speed~…an amenity variable associated with location and weather.
195~D4~V15~Variable~Average Number of Clear Days~…an amenity variable associated with location and weather.
195~D4~V16~Variable~Degree Days~…an amenity variable associated with location and weather.
195~D4~D4~Dataset~National Climatic Data Center~…the weather information was based on information from the National Climatic Data Center.
195~D4~V16~Variable~Degree Days~…degree days, representing deviations in temperature from 65 degrees Fahrenheit, are taken from a presentative period.
195~V16~L33~Variable Value~Heating Degree Days~…heating degree days by state refer to July 1994 to June 1995.
195~V16~L34~Variable Value~Cooling Degree Days~…cooling degree days by state refer to calendar year 1994.
195~D4~V14~Variable~Average Maximum Wind Speed~…data on the maximum wind speed were averaged over the available locations in each state for as many years as were available; wind readings from Mount Washington were excluded from the New Hampshire data.
195~D4~V15~Variable~Average Number of Clear Days~…data on the number of clear days was averaged over the available locations in each state for as many years as were available.
195~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College Graduate Pay Relative to National Average~…this pay variable is averaged for the year of graduation and four subsequent years and refers to full-time, full-year workers.
195~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College Graduate Pay Relative to National Average~…rates of pay for college graduates tend to be highest in heavily urban states in the East and lowest in heavily rural states. Eastern states in the top 10 for the sample period included New Jersey, Maryland, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia; the remaining top states were Alaska, California, and Michigan.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Probit~…omitted from the regression are the additional Greenwood-Hunt amenity variables that were never significant.
195~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College Graduate Pay Relative to National Average~…this variable was constructed using March Current Population Survey estimates for earnings for full-time, full-year workers divided by the number of hours worked. The use of the five-year average in part is to avoid year-to-year variability owing to the small state samples in the Current Population Survey.
195~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~HS Graduate Pay Relative to National Average~…this variable was constructed using March Current Population Survey estimates for earnings for full-time, full-year workers divided by the number of hours worked. The use of the five-year average in part is to avoid year-to-year variability owing to the small state samples in the Current Population Survey.
195~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…college graduate pay relative to the national average was constructed using March Current Population Survey estimates for earnings for full-time, full-year workers divided by the number of hours worked. The use of the five-year average in part is to avoid year-to-year variability owing to the small state samples in the Current Population Survey.
195~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Correlation Coefficient on Average Pay for College Graduates~…the correlation coefficient between average pay for college graduates in 1980-84 and in 1985-89 is 0.83; the correlation between 1980-84 and 1990-84 is 0.77.
195~D3, D5, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Housing Prices~…in 1980, seven of the top ten states were in the West: Hawaii, California, Alaska, Nevada, Colorado, Washington, and Wyoming. By 1990, although Hawaii and California continued to rank one and two, respectively, the remaining top ten jurisdictions were all on the East Coast: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, New Hampshire, the District of Columbia, and Maryland. The early 1990s saw relatively low housing inflation in states that had had the most rapid increases in the 1980s. Three New England states - Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts - went from being in the top ten in relative increase between 1985 to 1989 to the bottom ten in the 1990 to 1994 period. Nevertheless, despite these reversals, home prices in the Northeast (as well as in Hawaii and California) remained far above the national average through the end of the surveys.
195~D3, D5, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Housing Prices~…housing prices were constructed using a two-step procedure that made use of annual data on home price inflation and two years of data on home values. First a tentative house price series was constructed by starting with the median housing values reported in the 1980 Census of Housing and applying annual inflation rates calculated from the repeat-sales home price index issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Next, the inflation rates were adjusted additively by equal amounts each year so as to produce a 1990 house value that corresponded to that reported in the 1990 Census. Prices before 1980 and after 1990 were based on applying inflation rates from the repeat-sales home price index adjusted by the same constant. The largest upward adjustment was 0.9% for Oklahoma. The largest downward adjustment was 1.5% for Wyoming.
195~D5~D5~Dataset~Census of Housing~…a tentative house price series was constructed by starting with the median housing values reported in the 1980 Census of Housing and applying annual inflation rates calculated from the repeat-sales home price index issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
195~D6~D6~Dataset~Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Index~…a tentative house price series was constructed by starting with the median housing values reported in the 1980 Census of Housing and applying annual inflation rates calculated from the repeat-sales home price index issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
195~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…inflation rates were adjusted additively by equal amounts each year so as to produce a 1990 house value that corresponded to that reported in the 1990 Census.
195~D1, D3, D5, D6~F14~Findings~Correlation Coefficient on State Housing Prices~…the correlation coefficient between state housing price increases in 1990-94 and 1980-84 is -0.29; between 1990-94 and 1985-89 it is -0.89.
195~D3, D5, D6~DV8~Derived Variable~Housing Prices~…house prices are highly positively correlated with college graduate pay and coastal location, and highly negatively correlated with the unemployment rate.
195~D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College Graduate Pay Relative to National Average~…average pay for college graduates tends to be higher in more populous states and in states that have a seacoast.
195~D1~V13~Variable~Dummy For Seacoast~…average pay for college graduates tends to be higher in more populous states and in states that have a seacoast.
195~D1~V13~Variable~Dummy For Seacoast~…a dummy variable indicating for whether a state has access to a seacoast.
195~D1~V6~Variable~Migrated From College After College Graduation~…this dependent variable is the same as the one in the initial regression specification for the approximately 73% of the same who went to college in-state, but differs for the remaining 27% who went out-of-state.
195~D1~F15~Findings~Second Specification and Move from Birth to HS Impact~…in the secondary specification, someone who migrated between birth and high school is 8% more likely to move away from his or her college state than someone who had not, and someone who migrated between high school and college is 31% more likely to move post-college than someone who had not.
195~D1~F16~Findings~Second Specification and Seacoast Significance~…in the secondary specification, the significance of a coastal location becomes greater. Students who attend college in a state with a seacoast are 12% less likely to leave than students who attend college in an interior state.
195~D1, D4~F17~Findings~Third Specification and Degree Days Significance~…in the third specification, degree days matters, suggesting that higher utility costs cause recent high school graduates to flee the Frost Belt.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Probit~…a potential problem with the first three specifications of this model arises from the fat that moves of a similar distance are more likely to result in a crossing of state boundaries in some parts of the country than in others. The regressions attempted to correct for geographic differences by including state land area as an independent variable.
195~D4~V16~Variable~Degree Days~…degree days equals cooling plus heating degree days, but heating degree days dominate. The correlation between total degree days and heating degree days is 0.96.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the fourth and fifth specifications of this model are to adjust the dependent variable so as to exclude moves that arguably are minor. For example, a recent graduate could find a job very close to where he or she went to high school or college but choose to commute from a more distant location. In the first alternative definition of the dependent variable, moves from a state smaller than 10,000 square miles to a contiguous state are not counted. The second alternative specifically addresses the existence of labor market areas that span state boundaries.
195~D1~V18~Variable~Migrated After Graduation (noncontiguous variant)~…in the first alternative definition of the dependent variable, moves from a state smaller than 10,000 square miles to a contiguous state are not counted (that is, the dependent variable equals zero for moves from these states, unless the move is to a noncontiguous state).
195~D1~V18~Variable~Migrated After Graduation (noncontiguous variant)~…this change reduces the number of measured interstate moves in the Northeast - especially for those originating in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.
195~D1~V18~Variable~Migrated After Graduation (noncontiguous variant)~…jurisdictions with a land area less than 10,000 square miles are the following: Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermonth. The next smallest state, West Virginia, has an area of more than 24,000 square miles.
195~D1~V19~Variable~Migrated After Graduation (125-mile variant)~…the second alternative definition of the dependent variable specifically addresses the existence of labor market areas that span state boundaries. For example, it is possible to remain in the New York City area while moving among southern New Work, most of New Jersey, western Connecticut, and eastern Pennsylvania.
195~D1~V19~Variable~Migrated After Graduation (125-mile variant)~…in this alternative, interstate moves are counted only if they exceed 125 miles (regardless of size). This has the effect of re-categorizing moves for a more diverse set of states, including some relatively large states with a concentration of students attending college close to a state boundary.
195~D1, D2~F18~Findings~Alternative Specifications, Seacoast Significance, and High Pay Significance ~…the alternative regressions continue to show that college graduates prefer to remain in seacoast locations and in states where pay for college graduates is high. This latter finding is stronger than in the original regressions.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Probit~"…these regressions do not address the extent to which migration patterns were a reflection of economic opportunities and amenities in the new location (""pull""), as ooposed to a lack of opportunity or amenities in the home or college state (""push"")."
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Pull~…defined as the economic opportunities and amenities in the new location.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Push~…defined as the lack of opportunity or amenities in the home or college state.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Pull~"…ideally the effects of ""push"" versus ""pull"" can be studied by measuring the total gross or net flows of people between specific areas and relating this to conditions in the two areas."
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV10~Derived Variable~Push~"…ideally the effects of ""push"" versus ""pull"" can be studied by measuring the total gross or net flows of people between specific areas and relating this to conditions in the two areas."
195~D1, D3~DV11~Derived Variable~Distance~…distance is measured between origin and destination counties, based on an algorithm kindly provided by Jordan Rappaport.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY does indicate the location of each person in each year, but the total sample size is far too small to compute meaningful migration rates between specific states or even regions in any given year.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV12~Derived Variable~Proportion of Favorable College Graduate Moves ~"…indicates the proportion of moves by recent college graduates to a state with more favorable conditions than their state of origin. (In essence, by differencing the ""pull"" and ""push"" variables, this measure examines ""net pull."""
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F19~Findings~Net Pull, Employment Opportunities and Amenities~"…by ""net pull"" measures, employment opportunities and amenities appear to have been about equally important in determining the direction of college graduate migration decisions. For example, the first entry in the first column indicates that 58% of recent college graduates moved during the first five years to a state with higher average employment growth than their high school state. Similar fractions of moves were to states that had lower unemployment, a larger population, clearer weather, fewer degree days, and higher pay. One-half of all moves were to states with lower housing prices. Only 24% of moves were from interior states to states with a seacoast, but another 34% of moves were from one seacoast state to another, and only 11% of moves were from a seacoast state to an interior state."
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV13~Derived Variable~Proportion of Favorable High School Graduate Moves ~"…indicates the proportion of moves by recent high school graduates to a state with more favorable conditions than their state of origin. (In essence, by differencing the ""pull"" and ""push"" variables, this measure examines ""net pull."""
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F20~Findings~HS Graduate Favorable Moves~…70% of high school graduate moves were to states with higher employment growth and 64% to states with lower unemployment, but only 44% to states with high pay. In addition, higher shares of moves were to states with lower energy costs (as measured by degree days) and clearer weather.
195~D4~V16~Variable~Degree Days~…as a proxy for energy costs.
195~DV12, DV13~L35~Variable Value~Improvements in at Least 3 Variables~…indicates the proportion of each group that moved to states offering improvement in at least three of the nine economic conditions and amenities listed.
195~DV12, DV13~L36~Variable Value~Improvements in at Least 4 Variables~…indicates the proportion of each group that moved to states offering improvement in at least four of the nine economic conditions and amenities listed.
195~DV12, DV13~L37~Variable Value~Improvements in at Least 5 Variables~…indicates the proportion of each group that moved to states offering improvement in at least five of the nine economic conditions and amenities listed.
195~DV12, DV13~L38~Variable Value~Improvements in at Least 5 Variables Counting Moves to a Seacoast~…indicates the proportion of each group that moved to states offering improvement in at least five of the nine economic conditions and amenities listed counting all moves to a seacoast state.
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F21~Findings~HS- vs. College Graduate Propensity to Move Favorably~"…interestingly, high school graduates were more likely than college graduates to move to states where general conditions were ""better"" than in their origin states. About 63% of high school graduates' moves were to states that had improved rankings on the majority of indicators, versus 46% to 50% for college graduates. this disparity may possibly reflect the greater homogeneity of jobs available for non-college graduates than is the case in professional and technical occupations. That is, college graduates may be more likely than non-graduates to get a specific job offer that more than compensates for subpar economic condiitons or amenities."
195~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~V20~Variable~Economic Conditions or Ameneties~…a series of nine favorable economic conditions and amenities used in order to determine the proportion of favorable moves for both high school and college graduates.

195~D1, D3~F22~Findings~Pacific vs. New England Divisions and Out-of-State Migration~…in the NLSY sample, the Pacific states had the lowest proportion leaving for college (13%) and also the lowest proportion living out-of-state five years after college (17%). This contrasts sharply with the West North Central and New England states, which had the highest shares of students going out-of-state for college (35% to 36%) and highest remaining out-of-state after college (44% to 45%). This evidence on the Pacific versus the New England states suggests that the  structure of higher education may be one factor influencing migration.
195~V1~L9~Variable Value~Pacific~…the Pacific states - notably California - have an extensive, relatively low0cost, public higher education system, so most college-bound students in the region remain in the area for college.
195~V1~L1~Variable Value~New England~…New England's higher education establishment is heavily private, attracting many students from outside the region in addition to serving students from New Engand.
195~D1, D3~F23~Findings~Pacific Division In-Migration~…60% of college-graduate movers to the Pacific states came from states without a seacoast, by far the largest proportion of any region. Movers to the Pacific states enjoyed higher average employment grwoth and the highest percentage increase in expected pay (as measured by the difference in college-graduate pay between their new and old states). However they also faced the steepest increase in house prices with median home prices becoming almost twice as high as in the states where the in-migrants had gone to high school.
195~V1~L1~Variable Value~New England~…New England presents a particularly sharp contrast in geographic mobility between high school students who went on to four years of college and those who did not. While college graduates had exceptionally high geographic mobility as children, the rate for non-college graduates was close to the national average and their tendency to leave their home state after high school was comparatively low.
195~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…this data source encompasses graduating classes from the late 1970s through the early 1990s.
195~D1~F24~Findings~Five-Year Post-Graduation State Moves~…according to the NLSY data, five years after college graduation, 30% of the graduates no longer live in the state where they attended college and 35% no longer live in the state where they attended high school. These rates are at least twice as high as those for young adults who have less education.
195~D1~F25~Findings~Unfavorable Moves in the NLSY~…over 40% of the observed moves in the NLSY sample were to states with lower employment growth than in the origin state.
195~D1, D3~F26~Findings~South Atlantic and Mountain Divisions and College Graduate Inflows~…for the graduating classes analyzed in the NLSY (1979 to 1991), the South Atlantic and Mountain regions gained roughly 15% to 30% more young college graduates as a result of migration from other regions of the country, compared to the number of college graduates who had gone to high school there.

197~197: Minimum Wage Effects on Labor Market Outcomes under Search, Matching, and Endogenous Contact Rates~~~~
197~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…in the standard monopsony model of minimum wage effects, minimum wages lead to higher wages and employment levels, but lead to lower levels of firm welfare.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…by adding some general equilibrium elements to this standard monopsony model, it is possible for binding minimum wages to lead to increase in the welfare of firms as well; this is implemented through the use of a matching function formulation of the worker-firm contact rate.
197~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Hosios Condition~…specifies that the efficiency of equilibrium in such a framework requires that the elasticity of the matching function with respect to the size of the set of searchers be equal to the workers' share of the match surplus.
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Effective Bargaining Power~…in a world in which workers receive a low share of the surplus in comparison with their associated matching function elasticity, increases in the minimum wage can be viewed as a way to increase their effective bargaining power, leading to increased search activity on their part and an equilibrium outcome closer to what is obtained when the Hosios condition is satisfied.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…a goal of this estimation is to obtain estimates of worker bargaining power and the matching function elasticity so that optimal - in the sense of efficient - minimum wages can be determined in a general equilibrium setting.
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Effective Bargaining Power~…researchers assume that the workers' bargaining power is a primitive parameter determined outside of the model that is not necessarily equal to the match function elasticity.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…this variable is a crude, blunt tool potentially available to policy makers that can increase aggregate welfare in some situations.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…by estimation the primitive parameters of this model, researchers are able to determine what optimal minimum wages should have been given the labor market environment and standard welfare criteria.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…the model developed in this research is a logical descendent of the econometric model of search of Flinn and Heckman (1982) and the econometric model of minimum wage effects on the distribution of wages and the probability of employment estimated by Meyer and Wise (1983a, 1983b).
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…the FH model formulated an equilibrium continous-time search model in which searchers encountered potential employers according to a Poisson process; upon meeting, the potential value of the contact was determined by a draw from a fixed distribution; the setup of the basic model proposed here is similar, with the important difference that rents are divided using an explicit Nash-bargaining criteria.
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Effective Bargaining Power~…the bargaining power parameter that appears in this formulation is of key importance in determining the welfare consequences of imposing, or increasing, a minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Effective Bargaining Power~"…researchers think of the bargaining power parameter as being a sort of summary statistics of the labor market ""position"" of a particular group."
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable ~Effective Bargaining Power~…although researchers eventually conduct policy experiments that fix the value of the bargaining power parameter at our point estimate of it, it should be borne in mind that the validity of doing so is questionable, particularly when considering large policy (i.e. minimum wage) changes.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…Meyer and Wise (1983a, 1983b) estimated a model of minimum wage effects using individual-level data, which allowed them to infer what the wage distribution and employment level would have been in the absence of a minimum wage, with the main weakness of their model being the arbitrary specification manner in which a minimum wage distrorts the preexisting wage distribution; in the current model, optimizing behavior by searchers and firms determines the nature of this wage distribution distortion and it is roughly consistent with the Meyer and Wise specification.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…the environment considered in this paper is extremely simple and is solely generated by search frictions and differences in bargaining ability; within this model, researchers are able to define conditions under which minimum wages are welfare-enhancing, and by using estimates of model parameters, they are able to determine whether these conditions are satisfied at particular minimum wage levels while, in addition, they are able to arrive at estimates of the optimal level of the minimum wage under certain explicit welfare criteria.
197~D1~V2~Variable~Unemployment~…the implication of the model here is consistent with the fact that unemployment generally increases due to impositions of increased minimum wages; however with endogenous contact rates and labor market particiation decision, it is not necessarily the case that unemployment increases when the minimum wage does.
197~D1~V2~Variable~Unemployment~…when unemployment increases with the minimum wage, it is poosible for the steady state employment rate to increase due to inflows to the labor market.
197~D1~V3~Variable~Labor Market Inflows~…occur whenever the value of unemployed search increases as a result of the minimum wage change.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…the current model produces a mass point at the minimum wage without the implication of a discrete wage distribution.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~"…researchers first develop a ""restricted"" Nash-bargaining procedure that maps a continuous underlying productivity distribution into a mixed continuous-dscrete accepted wage distribution, with the sole mass point located at the minimum wage."
197~D1~V4~Variable~Arrival Rates~…rather than treating offer arrival rates as exogenously determine, researchers graft onto this model a matching function, the quantitative properties of which are important for assessing the welfare effects of changing the minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…using cross-sectional information from the supply side of the market and information on labor's share of revenues from the demand side, reseachers derive consistent estimators for all of the primitive parameters of the model.
197~D2~V5~Variable~Factors of Production~…researchers assume that the only factor of production is labor.
197~D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Total Firm Output~…simply the sum of the productivity levels of all of its employees.
197~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Disagreement Value~"…assuming that the only factor of production is labor and that total output of the firm is simply the sum of the productivity levels of all its employees, if the firm ""passes"" on the applicant, that is does not make an employment offer, its disagreement outcome is zero, i.e. it earns no revenue, but makes no wage payment."
197~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Disagreement Value~…a free entry assumption assures that the ex ante vaslue of an unfilled vacancy is zero, justifying the zero outside option assumption made in this section.
197~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Match Value~…firms employ someone with a specific match value.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…firms employ someone with an instanteneous wage payment.
197~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Profit~…the instantaneous profit from a specific employee is given by the match value minus the instantaneous wage paid.
197~D1~V4~Variable~Arrival Rates~…the arrival rate of contacts from the point of view of searchers.
197~D1~V4~Variable~Arrival Rates~…a predetermined primitive parameter
197~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Disagreement Value~…the applicant's disagreement value is the value of continued search.
197~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Disagreement Value~"…for any given disagreement value, there exists a correspondng critical ""match"" value."
197~V6~L1~Variable Value~Critical Match Value~"…for any given disagreement value, there exists a corresponding critical ""match"" value, which has the property that all matches with values at least as great as this critical value will result in employment, whereas all those matches of lower value will not."
197~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Nash-bargained Wage~…for any match value above the critical match value, the Nash-bargained wage is calculated using the value of being employed at a specific wage, the bargaining power parameter, and the disagreement value for a particular applicant.
197~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Employment Value~…the value of being employed at a particular wage.
197~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Effective Bargaining Power~…takes values in (0,1).
197~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Effective Discount Rate~…without loss of generality it has been assumed that the firm shares the employee's effective discount rate.
197~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Present Value to Employer of Match~…the present value to the employer of an employee match at a specific wage rate.
197~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Present Value to Employer of Match~…a firms instantaneous profits for a specific employee divided by the employee's effective rate of discount.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…the minimum wage is set by the government and is assumed to apply to all potential matches.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…it is assumed that the only form of compensation the firm is the wage, thus there are no other forms of compensation the firm can adjust so as to undo the minimum wage payment requirement.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…in terms of wage payments, the minimum wage acts solely as a side constrant on the Nash-bargaining problem.
197~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Present Value to Employer of Match~…the ex post value of the match from the point of view of the firm is proportional to instantaneous profits.
197~D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Profit~…firms cannot earn positive profits on matches that have a value less than the minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Present Value to Employer of Match~…firms cannot earn positive profits on matches that have a value less than the minimum wage.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…researchers only consider the case of binding minimum wages.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…because the minimum wage is greater than the critical match value, an immediate implication of the imposition of the minimum wage is that fewer contacts will result in jobs - the standard employment effect.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…under the constrained Nash-bargaining problem, there will exist a value of search which is dependent on the minimum wage.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~...in some specifications, researchers ignore the minimum wage constraint in determining the wage payment given a match value and the value of search, as well as parameters of bargaining power.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…if the match value is less than or equal to the minimum wage, then all feasible matches would generate wage offers at least as large as the minimum wage; however, when the match value is larger than the minimum wage, this is not the case.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…dependent on the surplus value associated with finding an acceptable match with an associated wage payment of the minimum wage and the surplus associated with finding a match value greater than the mean match value for which the minimum wage constraint is not binding.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…a binding minimum wage results in a postively valued wedge between the minimal acceptable wage imposed by the policy maker, i.e. the minimum wage, and the wage offer that a searcher would be willing to take, i.e. the reservation wage.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…refered to as the implicit reservation wage.
197~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Wage Distribution~…conditional on the value of the binding minimum wage.
197~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Wage Distribution~…the minimum wage side constraint in this measure produces an equilibrium wage distribution that has a mass point at the minimum wages and has wages continuously distributed on the interval from the minimum wage to infinity if match values themselves are continously distributed.
197~D1~V7~Variable~Outside Options~…in the case of endogeneous contact rates, outside options include schooling, leisure, etc., and because a large proportion of the 16 to 24 year old population that is the focus of this analysis does not participate in the marke, this is an important consideration.
197~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Value of Nonparticipation~…the normalized value of not participating in the labor market for an individual.
197~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Value of Nonparticipation~…assumes that in the population this random variable has a parametric distribution that includes a finite-dimensional parameter vector.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…if an agent enters the labor market, he or she enters as an unemployed searcher, the normalized value of which is the value of search given the minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Value of Nonparticipation~…all agents in the population with a value of nonparticipation less than or equal to the value of search will enter the market under the current minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…all agents in the population with a value of nonparticipation less than or equal to the value of search will enter the market under the current minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Returns to Technology~…there exists constant returns to scale matching technology dependent on the number of vacancies and the contact rate per vacancy.
197~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Searchers to Vacancies Ratio~…the ratio of the size of the set of unemployed searchers to the size of the set of vacancies in the market.
197~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Number of Unemployed Searchers~…the measure of the set of unemployed searchers.
197~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Vacancies~…the size of the set of vacancies.
197~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Contact Rate per Vacancy~…dependent on the ratio of searchers to vacancies.
197~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Contact Rate per Unemployed Agent~…equal to the contact rate per vacancy divided by the ratio of searchers to vacancies.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…one source of heterogeneity in this model could be permanent individual-specific differences in productivity..
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…contains extremely limited information content in regards to the topic of interest.
197~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Vacancies~…assuming that there exists a population of potential firm entrants with an outside option value of zero, firms create vacancies until the point that expected profits are equal to zero.
197~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cost of Vacancy~…the cost of creating a vacancy at a firm.
197~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cost of Vacancy~…always greater than 0.
197~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Value of Vacancy~…the expected value of creating a vacancy, dependent on the cost of vacancy creation, the contact rate per vacancy, the rate at which a firm fills a vacancy, the expected value of a filled vacancy, and the value of a vacancy.
197~D1~V8~Variable~Vacancy Value~…the value of a vacancy in the labor market
197~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Vacancy Fill Rate~…the rate at which a firm fills a vacancy.
197~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Value of a Filled Vacancy~…the expected value of a filled vacancy where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of acceptable matches where the actual match value is greater than or equal to the acceptable match value.
197~V6~L1~Variable Value~Critical Match Value~…the minimum for which the actual match value must be for an applicant in order for the firm to make the decision to employ.
197~D1~V8~Variable~Vacancy Value~…under the free entry assumption, the value of a vacancy is equal to 0.
197~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Probability of Unemployment~…in the steady state, this derived variable measures the probability that a labor market participant is unemployed.
197~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Number of Unemployed Searchers~…if the size of the set of labor market participants is incuded, then the size of the set of unemployed searchers relative ot the entire population can be calculated.
197~D1~V10~Variable~Labor Market Size~…the size of the set of labor market participants.
197~D1, D2~DV19~Derived Variable~Contact Rate per Unemployed Agent~…with endogenous contact rates, a labor market equilibrium in the presence of a minimum wage (that may or may not be binding) is characterized by a quadruplet of parameters including the size of the labor market, the size of unemployed searchers, the number of vacancies, and the value of search, which is solely a function of the primitive parameters.
197~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Contact Rate per Vacancy~…with endogenous contact rates, a labor market equilibrium in the presence of a minimum wage (that may or may not be binding) is characterized by a quadruplet of parameters including the size of the labor market, the size of unemployed searchers, the number of vacancies, and the value of search, which is solely a function of the primitive parameters.
197~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Labor Market Participation~…the rate of participation in the labor market, dependent on the size of the labor market and the arrival rate.
197~V4~L2~Variable Value~Critical Arrival Rate~…there exists a unique equilibrium in labor market participation if an donly if there exists a unique value of the critical arrival rate.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…given the nature of the data available and the focus on identification issues, on-the-job search is not considered in this paper.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…allowing on-the-job search in the matching function setup involves some modeling choices regarding how unemployed and employed searchers are to be treated in determining the size of the searching population.
197~D1~DV24~Derived Variable~Number of Nonparticipants~…at any point in time, all agents who are on the supply side of the market will be on the supply side of the market.

197~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Average Welfare Level NIL~…the average welfare level of the set of individuals who are out of the labor force under a particular minimum wage.
197~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Proportion of Unemployed ~…the proportion of the population unemployed.
197~D1~DV29~Derived Variable~Average Welfare Level UE~…all unemployed individuals have the same welfare level.

197~D1~DV30~Derived Variable~Average Welfare Level E~…the average welfare level for the proportion of the population who are employed in the steady state.
197~D1, D2~L5~Variable Value~Filled Vacancy~…the only term from the demand side that enters is associated with firms with a filled vacancy.
197~D1~DV24~Derived Variable~Number of Nonparticipants~…because it is assumed that the average welfare level for nonparticipants is continously distributed in the population, the number of nonparticipants is a monotonically decreasing function of the value of search dependent on a specific minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…any minimum wage change that results in an increasing value of search leads to greater labor force participation.
197~D1~V10~Variable~Labor Market Size~…any minimum wage change that results in an increasing value of search leads to greater labor force participation.
197~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Number of Unemployed Searchers~…the size of the set of searching participants is given by the participation rate multiplied by the steady state probability of unemployment, given participation.
197~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Number of Unemployed Searchers~…dependent on the contact rate, the acceptance match rate, and the equilibrium participation and vacancy creation decisions that a function of the minimum wage when it is binding.
197~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Probability of Unemployment~…used in determining the size of the set of searching participants in the labor market.
197~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Labor Market Participation~…the participation rate in the labor force used in determining the size of the set of searching participants in the labor market.
197~D1~V11~Variable~Size of Employed Market~…the size of the set of employed individuals is defined in a similar way to that of the size of unemployed searchers.
197~D1, D2~L5~Variable Value~Filled Vacancy~…in the common theoretical case that each firm creates at most one vacancy, which will be filled or unfilled at a given moment in time, the set of firm owners who have a filled vacancy must be equal to the size of the set of employed serachers.
197~D1~DV31~Derived Variable~Total Welfare~…where the welfare of all individuals, not in the labor force, unemployed, or employed, is considered.
197~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Participant's Welfare~…where the welfare of only participating individuals, is considered.
197~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Participant's Welfare~…these criteria would be the same if researchers were to make an analogous free entry condtion for the supply side of the market by normalizing the value of the nonparticipation state to equal zero for all population members; however, because this condition should not be imposed, researchers define a separate welfare measure that applies only to market participants.
197~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Participant's Welfare~...this measure will be the focus of the analysis, both because researchers can relate optimization of this social welfare function to the Hosios (1990) analysis and because their specification of welfare of nonparticipants on the supply side of the market is essentially arbitrary.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…given that researchers are only able to estimate extremely simple matching functions given the data available, the implications of the results are considered when the matching technology is Cobb-Douglas.
197~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable ~Hosios Condition~…when this condition holds, there is no scope for a minimum wage to increase aggregate welfare.
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable ~Effective Bargaining Power~…this measure is considered to be set by market forces, preference characteristics, and the generic bargaining environment, all of which are considered to be beyond the purview of the social planner; i.e. the axiomatic Nash-bargaining framework behind this research provides no explicit mechanism through which bargaining power is determined.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used in econometric analysis devoted to identification and estimation of bargaining power and optimal wages.
197~D2~D2~Dataset~McDonald's CSI~…data used in econometric analysis devoted to identification and estimation of bargaining power and optimal wages.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…may be viewed as an instrument to increase total welfare of labor market participants or the entire society.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this point-in-time sample contains only information on the length of time individuals currently unemployed have been actively searching for a job and the hourly wage rate and/or gross weekly earnings and usual hours worked per week for those reporting that they are currently employed; no information is available on the length of time an employed individuals have worked for their current employer.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the information in this data source will not be useful for learning the parameters that characterize the vacancy creation process; although researchers will be able to provide conditions under which the number of unemployed searchers is estimatable from the Current Population Survey data if data on vacancies are not available we cannot determine the ratio of unemployed searchers to vacancies.
197~D1, D2~DV25~Derived Variable~Vacancies~…given an estimator of the arrival rate based on Current Population Survey data and a consistent estimator for the number of unemployed searchesr, researchers will be able to estimate the steady state vacancy rate if the contact rate contains no unknown parameters.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data used for the purposes of estimating the labor market model developed in this research paper.
197~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Effective Bargaining Power~…the difficulties of estimating the bargaining power parameter using event history data such as those employed here have been appreciated for qhite some time.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…allowing for measurement error may be indicated when the sample contains very low wage observations, which without measurement error would imply a perhaps incredibly small reservation wage.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…in the presence of a binding minimum wage, it is not possible to add classical measurement error to the model.
197~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Wage Distribution~…if the wage distribution is assumed to be given by the convolution of the distribution of actual wages and some continously distributed independent and identically distributed random variable, then even though the true wage distribution is of the mixed continuous-discrete type, the observed wage distribution will be absolutely continuous.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…for the purposes of avoiding classical measurement error, it is assumed throughout this research that all data observations are measured exactly.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…each individual observation can be characterized by the pair of observations including the length of the ongoing spell of unemployed search and the reported hourly wage.
197~D1~V13~Variable~Length of Unemployment~…the length of the ongoing spell of unemployed search.
197~D1~V13~Variable~Length of Unemployment~…positive if the sample member is unemployed at the time of the survey and is otherwise equal to zero.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…if an individual is employed at the time of survey, the hourly wage is recorded.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…if an individual is paid an hourly wage, this variable corresponds to the hourly wage rate they report.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…if an individual is not paid on an hourly basis, the hourly rate is imputed by dividing the gross weekly wage by the usual hours of work per week; this imputation procedure is standard but is particularly problematic in this application because of the likely undercount of individuals paid exactly the minimum wage.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~...the vast majority of sample members report an hourly wage rate so that the imputation procedure has to be utilized for less than 20% of the sample.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…there are essentially three components of the likelihood function: one for the unemployed, one for the employed paid the minimum wage, and one for the employed paid more than the minimum wage.
197~D1~DV33~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Finding an Unemployed Worker with a Certain Length of Unemployment Duration~…given being in the unemployed state, the likelihood of finding someone in an ongoing spell of a certain length in the steady state is given by the ratio of the population survivor function of unemployment durations and the population mean duration of unemployment spells.
197~D1~DV34~Derived Variable~Population Survivor Function of UE Durations~…the population survivor of unemployment durations as the numerator in calculating the likelihood of finding someone in an ongoing spell of a certain length in the steady state.
197~D1~DV35~Derived Variable~Population Mean Duration of UE Spells~…the population mean duration of unemployment spells as the denominator in calculating the likelihood of finding someone in an ongoing spell of a certain length in the steady state.
197~D1~DV33~Derived Variable~Likelihood of Finding an Unemployed Worker with a Certain Length of Unemployment Duration~…when the population unemployment spell duration distribution is of negative exponential form, this likelihood is equal to the population distribution.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…researchers assume that whenever two or more population members are paid the minimum wage, the minimum wage is binding for their population type.
197~D1~DV36~Derived Variable~Likelihood Contribution of a Minimum Wage Worker~…researchers assume that whenever two or more population members are paid the minimum wage, the minimum wage is binding for their population type.

197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…the log likelihood for the parameters that describe the labor market environment of a given population including the number of individuals in the sample, the number of unemployed, the number paid the minimum wage, the number paid more than the minimum wage, the set of indices of sample members who are unemployed, the set of indices of sample members who are paid more than the minimum wage and the implicit reservation wage in the population.
197~D1~V14~Variable~Sample Size~…the number of individuals in the sample.
197~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Number of Unemployed Searchers~…the number of unemployed individuals in the sample.
197~D1~V15~Variable~Number of Minimum Wage Workers~…the number of employed individuals in the sample earning the minimum wage.
197~D1~V16~Variable~Number of Greater Wage Workers~…the number of employed individuals paid more than the minimum wage.
197~D1~DV39~Derived Variable~Unemployed Indices~…the set of indices of sample members who are unemployed.
197~D1~DV40~Derived Variable~Greater Wage Indices~…the set of indices of sample members who are paid more than the minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…when this value is equal to the critical match value, the implicit reservation wage is set for the sample population.
197~V6~L1~Variable Value~Critical Match Value~…when this value is equal to the value of search, the implicit reservation wage  is set for the sample population.
197~V6~L1~Variable Value~Critical Match Value~…the value of this variable is not a primitive parameter per se, but rather is a scalar that is determined endogenously and is a function of all the parameters of the model.
197~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Match Value~…for simplicity, researchers assume that this value is lognormally distributed in the population, a common distributional assumption in the analysis of wage and earnings data, and it also is a recoverable distribution.
197~V6~L1~Variable Value~Critical Match Value~…can be treated as a parameter to be estimated without loss of generality.
197~V6~L1~Variable Value~Critical Match Value~…when all parameter estimates have been obtained, the functional equation that determines this critical match value can be used with point estimates of all identified parameters to back out the locus of estimates.
197~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Wage Distribution~…under the assumption that the match value is distributed as a lognormal, the cumulative distribution function is given by the lognormal cumulative distribution function, which is a log location-scale distribution, in that the cumulative distribution function of the natural log of the match value is characterized by the location parameter and the scale parameter.
197~D2~DV41~Derived Variable~Labor's Share of Revenue~…the datum utilized from the firm side of the market is labor's share of revenue at some representative firm.
197~D2~V17~Variable~Representative Employee Force~…the set of employees at a representative firm at some arbitrary point in time.
197~D2~DV41~Derived Variable~Labor's Share of Revenue~…dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the number of employees at the firm, the ratio of average wages to average productivity is given.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…researchers form a concentrated likelihood function by substituting the estimation of bargaining power in the log-likelihood equation.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…the concentrated log likelihood function satisfies all regularity conditions for asymptotic normality.
197~D1~V7~Variable~Outside Options~…to be able to perform policy experiments, researchers also must have a consistent estimator of the distribution of outisd options, that is the parameter that indexes the distribution function.
197~D1~DV23~Derived Variable~Labor Market Participation~…dependent on the outside option distribution, and the associated parameter vector that is assumed to characterize this outside option distribution, as well as the value of search.
197~D1~V7~Variable~Outside Options~…knowledge of the value of search and one equilibrium value of the labor force participation rate is determined within the model enables us to uniquely determine at most a scalar value of the parameter vector that characterizes the outside option distribution.
197~D1~V7~Variable~Outside Options~…sufficient conditions for identification of the parameter that characterizes the outside option distribution are continuous differentiability of the cumulative distribution function of outside options both in its argument and in the parameter itself.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…from supply side information, researchers are able to obtain a consistent estimator of the value of search.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…this data source is a representative sample of United States households, so from this data researchers are able to obtain an unbiased and consistent estimator of the participation rate of the target population, or those participating in the labor force.
197~D1~V7~Variable~Outside Options~…assumed to be continously differentiable in both arguments over its support and the parameter space is continuously differentiable in both arguments as well.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…from the augmented Current Population Survey data, researchers can consistently estimate the contact rate parameter.
197~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Proportion of Unemployed ~…equal to the probability of unemployment rate times the labor market participation rate.
197~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Proportion of Unemployed ~…the proportion of the population who are unemployed at a point in time can be consistently estimated by the Current Population Survey proportion of sample members in that state.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the proportion of the population who are unemployed at a point in time can be consistently estimated by the Current Population Survey proportion of sample members in that state.
197~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Value of a Filled Vacancy~…the expected value of a filled job.
197~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cost of Vacancy~…because the primite parameters of the model include the wage distribution and because the expected value of a filled vacancy is determined by the model structure, then knowledge of the arguments of these three functions is sufficient to determine the cost of a vacancy.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…under these conditions, augmented Current Population Survey data are sufficient to estimate the cost of a vacancy consistently.
197~D1, D2~DV42~Derived Variable~Vacancy Rate~…information on the vacancy parameter cannot be assumed to be directly available.
197~D1, D2~DV42~Derived Variable~Vacancy Rate~…a productive factor in producing matches.
197~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Probability of Unemployment~…a productive factor in producing matches.
197~D1, D2~DV42~Derived Variable~Vacancy Rate~…knowledge of the matching function and consistent estimators of the contact rate and unemployment probability enables researchers to form a consistent estimator of the vacancy rate.
197~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cost of Vacancy~…subsituting the vacancy rate into an estimator of the cost of vacancy along with consistent estimators of other unknown parameters produces a consistent estimator of the cost of vacancy.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…using cross-sectional information from the Current Population Survey and labor share data, researchers can recover all of the parameters required to perform policy evaluation under the assumption of endogenous contact rates only if it is assumed that the matching function contains no unknown parameters; this stringent assumption is required due to the absence of credible measures of vacancy rates.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…multiple Current Population Survey cross-section data are considered when using the Outgoing Rotation Group samples from two months in which it is assumed that a steady state equilibrium (approximately) holds in each and where the minimum wages are different, with the earlier period having a minimum wage less than the later one; all primitive parameters are assumed to be identical in the two months.
197~D1, D2~DV43~Derived Variable~Matching Function~…researchers limit their attention to the case in which the matching function is Cobb-Douglas.
197~D1, D2~DV43~Derived Variable~Matching Function~…assumed to be CRS.
197~D1, D2~DV43~Derived Variable~Matching Function~…it is difficult to precisely estimate more than one parameter that characterizes this matching function.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…when two cross-sectional segments are used from the Current Population Survey, it is presumed that the earlier period holds a lesser binding minimum wage.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…it is known that the two different minimum wages will, in general, deliver different equilibrium outcomes.
197~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Value of a Filled Vacancy~…the equilibrium value of a filled vacancy under a specific minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Cost of Vacancy~…determined with either the initial or later period equilibrium values.
197~D1~V4~Derived Variable~Arrival Rates~…consistent estimators of the rate of arrival of contacts in the equilibrium associated with a minimum wage in a particular period.
197~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Value of a Filled Vacancy~…the value of expected value of a filled job in the equilibrium associated with a minimim wage in a particular period.
197~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Probability of Greater Wage~…the probability of drawing a match value greater than the minimum wage in the equilibrium associated with a minimum wage in a particular period.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…when there exists data from two ORG Current Population Surveys in which data outcomes are generated from steady state equilibrium behavior associated with two values of the minimum wage, a Cobb-Douglas matching function parameter and the cost of a vacancy can be consistently estimated if estimates of a function of other primitive parameters at the two equilibrium values satisfy a condition that restricts the estimator of the Cobb-Douglas parameters to the unit interval.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…although it can never be expected that the observations in the two Current Population Surveys to be exactly generated by two distinct steady state equilibria, the hope is that the approximation may be good enough to yield a credible estimate of the matching function parameter.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data used contain information on 16 to 24 year olds inclusive from the Outgoing Rotation Group monthly Current Population Survey samples; this age group is the main focus of the research because minimum wage workers are disproportionately younng and if minimum wage effects on welfare were determined to be small for this group of participants, they are likely to be even more insignificant for older individuals.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the months used in this analysis are September 1996, February and August 1997, and January 1998.
197~D1~T1~Time Period~1996-1998~…time period from which Current Population Survey data was drawn from September in 1996, February and August in 1997, and January in 1998.
197~D1, D2~DV43~Derived Variable~Matching Function~…identification of matching function parameters clearly depends on having access to Current Population Survey data at more than two points in time.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in September 1996, researchers assume that the market was in a steady state equilibrium at the minimum wag $4.25, which was due to expire at the end of the month; when moving to the new steady state equilibirium associated with the minimum wage of $4.75, there will be some transitional dynamics. to avoid caputring these effects, researchers perform pooled estimation exercises using data from 5 months after the change, when researchers hope the amarket has nearly reached its new steady state equilibrium.; further separation in time between the before and after observations can not be allowed because the minimum wage changes once again on September 1, 1997 and because the model specification allows for no changes in the price level (the change in the Consumer Price Index between September 1996 and February 1997 was about 1.1%).
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…in September 1996, researchers assume that the market was in a steady state equilibrium at the minimum wag $4.25, which was due to expire at the end of the month; when moving to the new steady state equilibirium associated with the minimum wage of $4.75, there will be some transitional dynamics. to avoid caputring these effects, researchers perform pooled estimation exercises using data from 5 months after the change, when researchers hope the amarket has nearly reached its new steady state equilibrium.; further separation in time between the before and after observations can not be allowed because the minimum wage changes once again on September 1, 1997 and because the model specification allows for no changes in the price level (the change in the Consumer Price Index between September 1996 and February 1997 was about 1.1%).
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log Likelihood~…to examine the sensitivity of estimates of the particular months chosen, researchers reestimate the model when the subsequent minimum wage change change occurs at the beginning of September 1997; unfortunately, the month before the change is August, a period when many students find temporary employment, a phenomenom that is at odds with the steady state equilibrium basis of our econometric model. The postchange month used in the pooled estimation exercise is January 1998, which also may exhibit some transitory labor market behavior in conjuction with the holiday period.
197~D1~F1~Findings~Mass Points at the Minimum Wage~…importantly for the prima facie validity of the model, in all four months there exists a mass point at the minimum wage, with the probabilities given by 0.053, 0.063, 0.047, and 0.075 and in terms of mass point rank in each month, these are the fourth, third, sixth, and second, respectively; the larger mass point size in each month correspond to natural reporting focal points.
197~D1~F2~Findings~Unemployment Rates and the Minimum Wage~…unemployment rates increased after each minimum wage change, from 0.097 to 0.119 during the period from September 1996 to February 1997, and from 0.082 to 0.104 from August 1997 to January 1998.
197~D1~F3~Findings~Average Wages and the Minimum Wage~…average wages increased following minimum wage changes, from 6.932 to 7.016 during the period from September 1996 to February 1997, and from 7.254 to 7.513 from August 1997 to January 1998, but one should bear in mind that these are nominal amounts and that the composition of the workforce tends to change between summer and nonsummer months.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…in some specifications of the model, dealing with the problem of inconsistency with observed wages below the minimum wage involved rounding all wages below the minimum up to the minimum wage, which adds approximately 0.05 of probability mass at the minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…in some specifications of the model, dealing with the problem of inconsistency with observed wages below the minimum wage were simply deleted from the sample.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…estimates of primitive parameters, and particularly the bargaining power parameter were found to be highly sensitive to outliers in the wage data and as a result, researchers rounded all wage observations greater than $30 per hour down to $30; no other modifications of duration or wage informatoin were made.
197~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Hourly Wage~…researchers rounded all wage observations greater than $30 per hour down to $30, affecting only about 10 cases in any given month.
197~D2~D2~Dataset~McDonald's CSI~…researchers have opted to approximate the ratio of total wages paid to firm revenues from one large United States corporation, McDonald's; this firm was selcted because it is the largest private sector employer in the United States, so the law of large number results that must be relied upon are appropriate, second, because this firm has a disproportionate number of employees from the age group in which researchers are interested in, i.e. those between the ages of 16 and 24, and third, because McDonald's is one of the few large employers in this sector that reports sufficiently disaggregated information in its consolidate statement of income to allow computation of the number in which researchers are interested.
197~D2~D2~Dataset~McDonald's CSI~…to obtain a value for the wage share at McDonald's, researchers have used informations from the company's 1996 CSI, which covers a period that includes the survey month of the Current Population Survey used.
197~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1996.0~…overlapping period from which Current Population Survey data and McDonald's CSI data are drawn.
197~D2~D2~Dataset~McDonald's CSI~…for purposes of homogeneity, researchers have restricted attention to revenues and costs associated with restaurants owned by the company, i.e. franchises have been excluded.
197~D2~DV44~Derived Variable~Net Revenue~…a value of net revenue is computed by subtracting costs of food and packaging plus occupancy and other operating expenses from total sales by company-operated restaurants.
197~D2~V18~Variable~Total Wages Paid~…given by payroll and other employee benefits.
197~D2~DV45~Derived Variable~Firm Wage Share~…the ratio of total wages paid to firm revenues.
197~D2~F4~Findings~Firm Wage Share Results~…the firm wage share for McDonald's was found to be 0.576 in 1996; it is worthwhile to note that the ratio seems to be relatively stable over time, for example, using the same computational method, the ratio was equal to 0.568 in 1995 and 0.560 in 1994.
197~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Contact Rate for 16-24 Year Olds~…the estimated value of the contact rate, 0.309, implies that offers arrive approximately every 3 months on average; keep in mind that these estimates apply to young participants, so the relative brevity of a job match is not surprising.
197~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Dismissal Rate for 16-24 Year Olds~…the dismissal rate estimate of 0.031 implies that the average length of a job is about 30 months; keep in mind that these estimates apply to young participants, so the relative brevity of a job match is not surprising.
197~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Lognormal Match Distribution Parameters~…the point estimates of the lognormal match distribution parameters are 2.301 and 0.528, respectively, and their standard errors of 0.036 and 0.020 indicate that they are precisely estimated.
197~D1~F8~Findings~Implicit Reservation Wage~…the point estimate of the implicit reservation wage is 3.093 and its estimated standard error is 0.146.
197~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Bargaining Power Parameter~…the point estimate of the bargaining power parameter is 0.424 and the estimated standard error is 0.007; with this level of precession, it is straightfoward to reject the null hypothesis of symmetric Nash bargaining. Also, the estimate clearly indicates that this class of worker is at a disadvantage with respect to extracting match surplus.
197~D2~D2~Dataset~McDonald's CSI~…use of the profit data contains a large amount of information regarding the size of the pie to be divided and results in what is considered to be a reasonable estimate under the current modeling assumptions.
197~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Wage Distribution~…models without on-the-job search must rely on larger values of bargaining power parameters to fit observed wage distributions.
197~D2~D2~Dataset~McDonald's CSI~…because the productivity and wage information is not available by demographic group in the company's CSI, researchers had to assume that the same bargaining power parameter applied to all groups.
197~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Bargaining Power by Race and Ethnicity~…youths who are black or Hispanic are estimated to have a slightly lower level of bargaining power than others at 0.383 versus 0.437, while also having a slightly lower estimated value of the mean and standard deviation of the logarith of the match value.
197~D1~V19~Variable~Race~…a binary variable specifying for white or black.
197~D1~V20~Variable~Ethnicitity~…a binary variable specifying for Hispanic or non-Hispanic.
197~D1~V21~Variable~Age~…analysis is limited to 16-24 year olds.
197~D1~V22~Variable~Gender~…a binary variable specifying for male or female.
197~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Bargaining Power by Gender~…when researchers divide the sample along gender lines, it is found that males are estimated to have a slightly higher degree of bargaining power than females, as well as having higher parameter values.
197~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Contact Rate for 16-24 Year Olds in August 1997~…due to the lower aggregate unemployment during August 1997, the contact rate is substantially higher using this sample.
197~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Value of Search and the Minimum Wage~…the estimate of the value of search when the minimum wage is $4.75 is significantly greater than the estimate of the value of search when the minimum wage is $4.25, which is due not only to real minimum wage impacts, but also to inflation.
197~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Bargaining Power in August 1997 vs. September 1996~…estimates of the bargaining power are substantially lower in August 1997 than in September 1996, a change that is partially produced by the change in the shape of the estimated match distribution, as well as due to composition effects in that the August sample includes more seasonal workers than the September sample does, and it may be that this group of workers has less bargaining power than their less seasonal counterparts.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…used to determine directly whether or not the minimum wage increase that occurred at the end of September 1996 was beneficial in the sense of the first welfare measure, the value of unemployed search; these estimates were only analyzed for the total sample in which researchers began by combining the September 1996 CPS-ORG sample with an analogous sample from the February 1997 survey, and given the sample design, these two surveys do not include the same individuals.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…for individuals who earned less than $4.25 in September 1996, researchers assigned them a wage of $4.25, the then current minimum, and similarly, researchers assigned all those who were making less than $4.75 an hour in February 1997 a wage rate of $4.75.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…for inferences from the results to be valid, constancy of environmental parameters must remain constant.
197~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Value of Search~…in the absence of endogenous contact rates and a labor market participation decision, no other assumptions are required to obtain valid estimates of primitive parameters and the value of search before and after the minimum wage change as long as the implicit reservation wage after the minimum wage change is no larger than the initial minimum wage rate.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…in terms of application, researchers require the value of search at a minimum wage of $4.75 is less than $4.25; if this is the case, then even under the old minimum wage, match values between 4.25 and 4.75 will be accepted because working at the wage associated with such a match value given a minimum wage of $4.25 has a higher value than waiting to search under the new minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…this model is estimated to determine whethere or not the minimum wage increase that occured at the end of September 1996 was beneficial in the sense of the value of unemployed search under three specifications: the first in which it was assumed that all primitive parameters remained fixed between September and February, and that the rate of contacts between searchers and firms remained fixed, the second in which allows the value of search to change between periods, but imposes constancy of the contact rate, and the third in which both the contact rate and the value of search are allowed to change after imposition of the new minimum wage.
197~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Fixed Contact Rates, Value of Search, and the Minimum Wage~…holding the contact rate fixed, the value of search does seem to have increased slightly between Septemeber and February, with the likelihood ratio statistic havin a p-value of 0.118 under the null of no change.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…researchers pooled monthly data from the August 1997 and January 1998 in the estimation, and recoded all positive August wages less than $4.75 to $4.75 and all positive January wages less than $5.15 to $5.15.
197~D1~F16~Findings~p-value for the Implicit Reservation Wage Estimate~…although the point estimate of the implicit reservation wage did increase, the p value associated with the test statistic is only 0.215, while there is no indication that the contact rate changed between the two months; whereas the value of search seems to have increased to some degree, the change is at best marginally significant.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~In forming the estimates of the identifiable primitive parameters, researchers begin with those that use data from a single cross section. In this case, it is shown that a one-parameter outside option value distribution could be identified along with the cost a vacancy, but the matching distribution could have no unknown parameters. Researchers then utilize the pooled cross-sectional information to consider the estimation of the same parameters, with the addition of the single unknown parameter from the Cobb-Douglas matching function.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…whereas in some specifications of the model, the data used are from the single month of September 1996, a known matching function must be assumed with the CRS form.
197~D1, D2~F17~Findings~September 1996 Vacancy Rate~…the estimated vacancy rate in September was 0.020, which should be compared with the unemployment rate (in the population) of 0.062.
197~D1, D2~F18~Findings~September 1996 Matching Function Elasticity~…the matching function elasticity, with respect to the unemployment rate, is only 0.147.
197~D1, D2~F19~Findings~September 1996 Flow Vacancy Cost~…the estimated flow cost of a vacancy is 128.960.
197~D1, D2~F20~Findings~September 1996 Parameter Value~…the estimated parameter value of the negative exponential distribution of outside values is 0.326.
197~D1, D2~F21~Findings~August 1997 Vacancy Rate~…the vacancy rate is estimated to be 0.030 in August, which is a value 50% greater than what was inferred 11 months earlier
197~D1, D2~F22~Findings~August 1997 Flow Vacancy Cost~…the flow vacancy coast estimate declines a bit to 105.025.
197~D1, D2~F23~Findings~August 1997 Matching Function Elasticity~…the matching function elasticity is found to be substantially higher in August 1997 than in September 1996, moving from 0.147 to 0.333.
197~D1, D2~F24~Findings~August 1997 Parameter Value~…the estimated bargaining power parameter obtained using data from August 1997 is equal to 0.375, implying that the Hosios condition was approximately satisfied. 
197~D1, D2~F25~Findings~Pooled Data Vacancy Rate~…using the pooled information and a different matchng function, the vacancy rate for August is estimated to be 0.024 as opposed to 0.30.
197~D1, D2~F26~Findings~Pooled Data Flow Vacancy Cost~…using the pooled information and a different matching function, the flow cost of a vacancy declines all of the way to 2.46, which is a huge drop form the single sample estimates of over 100; kepp in mind, however, that the estimator of vacancy cost is quite different in the two contexts.
197~D1, D2~F27~Findings~Elasticity of One Parameter Matching Function~…the elasticity of the one-parameter matching function with respect to the search input from the supply side of the market is the Cobb-Douglas parameter, which is found to equal 0.196, which lies between the elasticities computed under the matching function used with the single month data.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~… contains hourly wage distributions for individuals 16 to 24 years of age in September 1996 and February 1997.
197~D1, D2~T2~Time Period~1996.0~…the federal minimum wage was officially changed from $4.25 to $4.75 on September 30, 1996.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data from September 1996 are from the month preceding the changes and those from February 1997 were collected approximately five months after the change.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in both September 1996 and February 1997,there are about 5% of individuals that report hourly wage rates below the mandated minimum wage; however this aspect of the wage distribution is neglected as researchers do not allow for measurement error and the model assumes complieance with the law.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…in both September 1996 and February 1997,there are about 5% of individuals that report hourly wage rates below the mandated minimum wage; however this aspect of the wage distribution is neglected as researchers do not allow for measurement error and the model assumes complieance with the law.
197~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the estimation phase, researchers first round all minimum wages below the minimum wage up to the minimum wage; after this transformation the proportion of the sample at the minimum wage is over 10% in both months so the overprediction at the mass point is not substantial.
197~D1~V1~Variable~Minimum Wage~…in the estimation phase, researchers first round all minimum wages below the minimum wage up to the minimum wage.
197~D1~V13~Variable~Length of Unemployment~…respondents report search duration in weeks, which researchers have converted to months here because the econometric model utilizes that time period.
197~D1~F28~Findings~Histogram Trends~…in terms of the histograms from the Current Population Survey samples, researchers see a fairly regular pattern of decreasing sample proportions with duration, although there are a number of exceptions that tend to occur at natural focal points, especially pronounced at 4, 8, 12, 36, and 52 weeks.
197~D1~DV42~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Steady State Distribution~…in order to determine the welfare and unemployment impacts of the minimum wage, researchers plot the equilibrium steady state distribution of the population across labor market states as a function of the minimum wage.
197~D1~V11~Variable~Size of Employed Market~…equal to the size of the set of firms with filled vacancies.
197~D1~DV46~Derived Variable~Average Steady State Values Associated With Labor Force Status~…researchers plot the average steady state values associated with the states of out of the labor force, unemployment, employment, and having a filled vacancy.
197~D1~DV31~Derived Variable~Total Welfare~…researchers plot the values of the two aggregate weflare measures, differentiated by whether they include the NILF subpopulation.
197~D1~DV32~Derived Variable~Participant's Welfare~…researchers plot the values of the two aggregate weflare measures, differentiated by whether they include the NILF subpopulation.
197~D1~F29~Findings~Employed Population and the Minimum Wage~…it is found that the size of the employed population actually increases by a small amount, with increases in the minimum wage up to approximately $8 per hour, after which it begins to decrease relatively rapidly.
197~D1~F30~Findings~NILF Population and the Minimum Wage~…the size of the NILF population declines as the minimum wage increases up to the point at which the value of unemployed search begins to decrease, while the unemployed population grows steadily through the minimum wage increase.
197~D1~F31~Findings~Optimal Minimum Wage for the UE~…the value of the minimum wage that maximizes the value of the unemployed is $8.29 while the value of the minimum wage that maximizes the welfare of labor market participants is $8.66, which is slightly more than double the baseline value.
197~D1~F32~Findings~Employement Trends at $5.00/hour~…the decreases in the number of employed individuals is already significant even for a minimum wage of $5.
197~D1~F33~Findings~Average Employed Welfare at $3.33/hour or Less~…the average welfare of employed individuals increases in the minimum wage up to $3.33, at which point it begins to decrease in minimum wage.
197~D1~F34~Findings~Aggregate Labor Market Welfare and the Minimum Wage~…when researchers form the aggregate labor market welfare measure, the end result is a single-peaked function of the minimum wage that has its maximum at $3.36.
197~D1~F35~Findings~Aggregate Labor Market Welfare Measure~…under the current model, whether with endogenous contact rates or not, the aggregate labor market welfare measure was 613.975.
197~D1~F36~Findings~$8.66 Minimum Wage and Participation~…at a minimum wage of $8.66, there is significantly more participation in the labor market by individuals on the supply side; the NILF rate decreases 13% from the baseline value, and a marked increase in the unemployment rate of labor market participants, on the order of 48%. 
197~D1~F37~Findings~$8.66 Minimum Wage and Aggregate Labor Market Welfare~…at a minimum wage of $8.66, the aggregate labor market welfare increases by 24.2%.
197~D1~F38~Findings~Optimal Minimum Wage Under Endogenous Contact Rates~…under endogenous contact rates, the optimal minimum wage is 20% less than the baseline value.
197~D1~F39~Findings~Optimal Minimum Wage Under Endogenous Contact Rates and Participation~…at the optimal minimum wage under endogenous contact rates, the market participation rate is slightly greater than at the baseline and the unemployment rate among participants decreases by about 5%.
197~D1~F40~Findings~Aggregate Labor Market Welfare and Optimal Minimum Wage Measures~…aggregate labor market welfare is less than 2% greater than in the baseline at the optimal minimum wage under endogenous contact rates.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~"…the model with endogenous contact rates has the advantage of being a general equilibrium one, even if it is extremely stylized; however, the main disadvantage of that model, from an empirical persepctive, is the necessity of utilizing a simple ""black box"" matching technology (with no unknown parameters) to close it."
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…because identification requirements severely limit the range of matching technologies that can be considered,  the sensity of tmodel estimates and policy implications can not be properly assessed to variation in the specication of this function.
197~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Log-Likelihood~…this model is parsimoniously specified in that the equilibrium wage and unemployment spell distributions are characterized in terms of a small set of primitive parameters.
197~D1~F41~Findings~Bargaining Power Parameter vs. Match Function Elasticity~…the researchers' estimates of the bargaining power parameter, although significantly less than 0.5, are significantly larger than our estimates of the match function elasticity and, as a result, yield an optimal minimum wage rate less than the then current value of $4.25.
198~198: Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania~~~~
198~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
198~D1~T1~Time Period~Pre-Minimum Wage Increase~…time period through which a first wave of interviews were conducted just before the rise in the minimum wage in New Jersey, February and March of 1992.
198~D2~T2~Time Period~Post-Minimum Wage Increase~…time period through which a second wave of interviews were conducted 7 to 8 months after the rise in minimum wage, November and December 1992.
198~D2, D3, D4, D5~T3~Time Period~1992.0~…year in which New Jersey legislature enacted a minimum wage increase to $5.05 per hour effective on April 1st, giving the state the highest state minimum wage in the country.
198~D4, D5~V1~Variable~State Minimum Wage~…as the main explanatory variable in this research paper.
198~V1~L1~Variable Value~New Jersey Minimum Wage~…as the main state minimum wage of interest in which the minimum wage experienced a significant increase during the relevant time period.
198~V1~L2~Variable Value~Pennsylvania Minimum Wage~…as the control state minimum wage due to the interrelated nature of Pennsylvania's and New Jersey's economies as well as the lack of a significant minimum wage increase during the relevant time period.
198~D1~D1~Dataset~1st Wave Interviews~…the first wave of the survey was conducted by telephone in late February and early March 1992 including questions on employment, starting wages, prices, and other store characteristics.
198~D1~D1~Dataset~1st Wave Interviews~…all interviews focus on a sample frame of fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania from the Burger King, KFC, Wendy's and Roy Rogers chains.
198~D1~D1~Dataset~1st Wave Interviews~…473 stores in the sample frame had working telephone numbers, and subsequently, these restaurants were called as many as nine times to elicit a response resulting in a total number of completed interviews from 410 of the restaurants, for an overall response rate of 87%.
198~D1~D1~Dataset~1st Wave Interviews~…the response rate was higher in New Jersey, at 91%, than in Pennsylvania, at 72.5%, because the interviewer made fewer call-backs to nonrespondents in Pennsylvania, which might have created biases due to the fact that response rates per call-back were almost identical in the two states.
198~D2~D2~Dataset~2nd Wave Interviews~…all interviews focus on a sample frame of fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania from the Burger King, KFC, Wendy's and Roy Rogers chains.
198~D2~D2~Dataset~2nd Wave Interviews~…the second wave of the survey was conducted in November and December 1992, about eight months after the minimum-wage increase.
198~D2~D2~Dataset~2nd Wave Interviews~…only the 410 stores that responded in the first wave interviews were contacted in the second round of interviews.
198~D2~D2~Dataset~2nd Wave Interviews~…researchers successfully interviewed 371, or 90%, of the 410 stores by phone, however researchers hired an interviewer to drive to each of the 39 nonrespondents and determine whether the store was still open through which it was discovered that six restaurants were permanently closed, two were temporarily closed, and two were under renovation; however, of the 29 stores open for business, all but one granted a request for a personal interview, resulting in a second-wave interview data for 99.8% of the restaurants that responded in the first wave of the survey, and information on closure status for 100% of the sample.
198~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Employment~…full-time-equivalent employment is calculated as the number of full-time workers, including managers, plus 0.5 times the number of part-time workers.
198~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Employment~…employment in wave 2 is set to 0 fro permanently closed stores but is treated as missing for the temporarily closed stores.
198~D1, D2~V2~Variable~Ownership Status~…a binary variable indicating whether a chain is company-owned or franchisee-owned.
198~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Average FTE Employment in NJ and PA~…in wave 1, average employment was 23.3 full-time equivalent workers per store in Pennsylvania, compared with an average of 20.4 in New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Starting Wages~…the typical starting wage for an employee at an individual store specified for the wave of interview.
198~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Hours of Operation~…the time through which the store operates on a typical weekday.
198~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Fraction of Full-Time Workers~…the proportion of full-time workers, rather than part-time workers or full-time-equivalent workers, employed at an individual store.
198~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Prevalence of Bonus Programs~…these programs offer current employees a cash bounty for recruiting any new employee who stays on the job for a minimum period of time.
198~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase Impact on Starting Wage ~…the average starting wage at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey increased by 10% following the rise in the minimum wage.
198~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Higher-Wage Restaurants Minimum Wage Increase Spillover~…the minimum-wage increase had no apparent spillover on higher-wage restaurants in the state as the mean percentage wage change for these stores was -3.1%.
198~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Reliability Ratio~…assesses the reliability of the survey questionnaire by comparing the responses of stores that were inadvertently interviewed twice in the first wave of the survey.
198~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Reliability Ratio~…assuming that measurement errors in the two interviews are independent of each other and independent of the true variable, the correlation between responses gives an estimate of the ratio of the variance of the signal and noise.
198~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Probit~…analysis of the probability of store closure in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
198~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Probability of Store Closure~…a probit analysis of the probability of closure shows that the initial size of the store is a significant predictor of closure, whereas the level of starting wages has a numerically small and statistically insignificant coefficient in the probit model.
198~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Reliability Ratio Results~…estimated reliability ratios are fairly high ranging from 0.70 for full-time equivalent employment to 0.98 for the price of a meal.
198~V3~L3~Variable Value~$4.25 per hour~…classifies New Jersey stores that had a starting wage that was exactly $4.25 per hour, or the previous minimum wage in the state.
198~V3~L4~Variable Value~$4.26 to $4.99 per hour~…classifies New Jersey stores that had a starting wage that was in the range between $4.26 and $4.99 per hour, the transitory minimum wages that existed before April 1, 1992.
198~V3~L5~Variable Value~$5.00 or more per hour~…classifies New Jersey stores that had a starting wage that was $5.00 per hour or more, or near, equal to, or greater than the maximum minimum wage in 1992.
198~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Average Employment Change Between Waves 1 and 2~…the average employment changes between 1 and 2 are computed by taking the differences between the averages for the two waves, or simply row 2 minus row 1.
198~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Alternate I Average Employment Change Between Waves 1 and 2~…here, the change in employment is computed only over the subsample of stores that reported valid employment data in both waves, or the balanced subsample.
198~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Balanced Subsample~…a group of stores for which there exists valid employment data in both waves.
198~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Alternative II Average Employment Change Between Waves 1 and 2~…presents the average change in employment in the balanced subsample, treating wave-2 employment at the four temporarily closed stores as zero, rather than missing.
198~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and New Jersey Store Employment~…the relative gain in New Jersey store employment due to the minimum wage increase, or the differences in differences changes in employment, is 2.76 full-time-equivalent employees, or 13%, with a t-statistic of 2.03, with the relative change between New Jersey and Pennsylvania stores virtually identical when analysis is restricted to the balanced subsample and only slightly smaller when employment at the temporarily closed stores is treated as zero.
198~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Average High Wage Store Employment ~…the average employment at high-wage stores in New Jersey changed by -2.16 full-time-equivalent employees, a change that is almost identical to the change among Pennsylvania stores; since New Jersey should have been largely unaffected by the new minimum wage, this comparison provides a specification test of the validity of the Pennsylvania control group, a test that clearly passes.
198~D3~F8~Findings~McDonald's Restaurant Chain and Cyclicality of Fast-Food Restaurant Sales~…to investigate the cyclicality of fast-food restaurant sales, researchers regressed the year-to-year change in United States sales of the McDonald's restuarant chain from 1976 to 1991 on the corresponding change in the unemployment rate estimating that a 1-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate reduces sales by $257 million, with a t-statistic of 3.00.
198~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Employment Model~…where the change in employment from wave 1 to wave 2 at a specific store is the estimated outcome and explanatory variables include a set of characteristics of the store, and either a dummy variable specifying for stores located in New Jersey or an alternative measure of the impact of the minimum wage at the store level based on the initial wage at that store.
198~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Store Characteristics~…a set of characteristics at the store level in order to explain changes in employment from wave 1 to wave 2 as a result of the minimum wage increase in New Jersey.
198~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~V8~Variable~New Jersey~…a dummy variable that equals 1 for stores that are located in New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~GAP~…an alternative measure of the impact of the minimum wage at a specific store based on the initial wage at that store.
198~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~GAP~…the proportional increase in wages at a specific store necessary to meet the new minimum rate.
198~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~GAP~…variation in this variable reflects both the New Jersey-Pennsylvania contrast and differences within New Jersey bsased on reported starting wages in wave 1.
198~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~GAP~…conditional on GAP, there is no difference in wage behavior between stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
198~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Employment Model~…all analysis using this methodology is restricted to the set of stores with available employment and wage data in both waves of the survey, a restriction that results in a slightly smaller estimate of the relative increase in employment in New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Proportional Wage Change and GAP Coefficient~…a regression of the proportional wage change between waves 1 and 2 on GAP has a coefficient of 1.03.
198~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Employment Model~…researchers later introduce a set of four control variables: dummies for three of the chains and another dummy for company-owned stores.
198~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~GAP~…used to measure the effect of the minimum wage with a better fit than the simple New Jersey dummy variable, although its implications for the New Jersey-Pennsylvania comparison are similar.
198~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Mean GAP in New Jersey Relative to Pennsylvania~…the mean value of GAP among New Jersey stores is 0.11, implying a 1.72 increase in full-time-equivalent employment in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania.
198~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Employment Model~…since GAP varies within New Jersey, it is possible to add both GAP and the New Jersey dummy variable to the employment model, through which the estimated coefficient on the New Jersey dummy variable provides a test of the Pennsylvania control group.
198~D1, D2~F11~Findings~GAP and New Jersey Dummy Variable Regression Results~…when the employment model is estimated with the addition of both GAP and the New Jersey dummy variable, the coefficient of the New Jersey dummy is insignificant with t ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.7, implying that inferences about the effect of the minimum wage are similar whether the comparison is made across states or across stores in New Jersey with higher and lower initial wages.
198~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Burger King~…a chain based dummy variable included in some alterations of the employment model.

198~D1, D2~V13~Variable~Ownership Status~…a binary variable that specificies for company ownership included in some alterations of the employment model.
198~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Employment Model~…researchers later measure an even stronger test with the addition of five regional variables controlling for any region-specific demand shocks and identify the effect of the minimum wage by comparing employment changes at higher- and lower-wage stores within the same region of New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V14~Variable~North New Jersey~…a regional dummy variable for the state of New Jersey added to some alterations of the employment model used to control for any region-specific demand shocks and identify the effect of the minimum wage by comparing employment changes at higher- and lower-wage stores within the same region of New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Central New Jersey~…a regional dummy variable for the state of New Jersey added to some alterations of the employment model used to control for any region-specific demand shocks and identify the effect of the minimum wage by comparing employment changes at higher- and lower-wage stores within the same region of New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Sourth New Jersey~…a regional dummy variable for the state of New Jersey added to some alterations of the employment model used to control for any region-specific demand shocks and identify the effect of the minimum wage by comparing employment changes at higher- and lower-wage stores within the same region of New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V17~Variable~Allentown-Easton~…a regional dummy variable for the state of Pennsylvania added to some alterations of the employment model used to control for any region-specific demand shocks and identify the effect of the minimum wage by comparing employment changes at higher- and lower-wage stores within the same region of New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Northern Suburbs of Philadelphia ~…a regional dummy variable for the state of Pennsylvania added to some alterations of the employment model used to control for any region-specific demand shocks and identify the effect of the minimum wage by comparing employment changes at higher- and lower-wage stores within the same region of New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~F12~Findings~GAP Coefficient Variation~…the GAP coefficients suggesting the increase in minimum wages raised employment at New Jersey stores that were initially paying $4.25 per hour vary from 14% for the base model and 7% for the corresponding proportional model.
198~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Proportional Change In Employment~…defined as the change in employment divided by the average level of employment in waves 1 and 2.
198~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Alternative I Employment~…in some alternative specification tests, employment is redefined to exclude management employees.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…estimates alternative specifications than previous models that probe the robustness of the conclusion that contradicts the standard prediction that a rise in the minimum wage will reduce employment.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…not that these models include chain dummies and a dummy for company-owned stores.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…researchers alter this estimator by setting wave-2 employment at the temporarily closed stores to 0.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…researchers later estimate this model using alternative measures of full-time-equivalent employment, including using a redefined measure of employment, a reweight of part-time workers.
198~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Alternative II Employment~…in some alternative specification tests, part-time workers are reweighted as 40% of full-time workers instead of the standard 50%.
198~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Alternative III Employment~…in some alternative specification tests, part-time workers are reweighted as 60% of full-time workers instead of the standard 50%.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…researchers alter this specification model to exclude 35 stores in towns along the New Jersey shore which may have a different seasonal pattern than other stores in the remainder of the sample.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…researchers alter the specification model by adding a set of dummy variables that indicate the week of the wave-2 interview.
198~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Three Calls~…indicates that a store was called back more than twice, a specification that excludes stores in some estimates of the specification models.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…to check the sensitivity of the results, this model is alternatively estimated based on a subsample that excludes any stores that were called back more than twice.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…this model is altered to present weighted estimation results for the proportional-employment-change models, using as weights the initial levels of employment in each store.
198~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Proportional Change In Employment~...the proportional change in average employment is an employment-weighted average of the proportional changes at each store.
198~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Weighted Relative Increase in New Jersey Employment~…the weighted estimate of the New Jersey dummy implies a 13% relative increase in New Jersey employment, the same proportional employment effect implied by the simple difference-in-differences model suggesting that the proportional effect of the rise in the minimum wage was concentrated among larger stores.
198~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Weighted GAP Coefficient and Proportional Change in Employment~…the weighted estimate of the GAP coefficient in the proportional-change model, 0.81, is close to the implied elasticity of employment with respect to wages from the basic levels specification, suggesting that the proportional effect of the rise in the minimum wage was concentrated among larger stores.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…this model is altered to address the possibility of unobserved demand shocks by estimating results based on subsamples of stores in two narrowly defined areas: towns around Newark, then towns around Camden.
198~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Around Newark~…a specification variable indicating that a store is near the town of Newark identified by the first three digits of the store's zip code.
198~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Around Newark~…the 070 three-digit zip-code area has one of the largest numbers of stores among three-digit zip-code areas in New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Around Camden~…the 080 three-digit zip-code area has one of the largest numbers of stores among three-digit zip-code areas in New Jersey.
198~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Around Camden~…a specification variable indicating that a store is near the town of Camden identified by the first three digits of the store's zip code.
198~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Specification Tests~…this model is altered to exclude stores in New Jersey and incorrectly define the GAP variable for Pennsylvania stores as the proportional increase in wages necessary to raise the wage to $5.05 per hour.
198~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~GAP~…the proportional increase in wages necessary to raise the wage to $5.05 per hour.
198~D1, D2~M6~Methodology~First Difference~…implies that the level of employment in a particular period is related to the lagged level of employment with a coefficient of 1, unless short-run employment fluctuations are smoothed, when which the true coefficient of lagged employment may be less than 1.
198~D1, D2~M6~Methodology~First Difference~…to test the first-differenced specification, researchers reestimated models for the change in employment including wave-1 employment as an additional explanatory variable.

198~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Wave 1 Employment Explained by GAP, Ownership and Chain~…in a specification including the GAP variable and ownership and chain dummies, the coefficient of wave-1 employment is 0.04, with a standard error of 0.24.
198~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Probit~…estimates from regressions of the change in the proportion of full-time workers on the wage-gap variable, chain dummies, and region dummies.
198~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Relative Full-Time Worker Change~…the fraction of full-time workers increased in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania by an insignificant 7.3%.
198~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Hours of Operation~…the number of hours a restaurant is open on a weekday.
198~D1, D2~V24~Variable~Free Meals~…indicates whether a store offers free meals to its employees.
198~D1, D2~V25~Variable~Reduced-Price Meals~…indicates whether a store offers reduced-priced meals to its employees.
198~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Fringe Benefits~…the proportion of restaurants offering reduced-price meals fell in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania after the minimum wage increased, with a somewhat greater decline in New Jersey; however, this decline in reduced-price meal programs was accompanied by an increase in the fraction of stores offering free meals, with New Jersey employers ultimately shifting toward more generous benefits than Pennsylvania employers.
198~D1, D2~M1~Methodology~Probit~…used to estimate the effect of the minimum-wage increase on the incidence of free meals and reduced-price meals.
198~D1, D2~V26~Variable~Normal Wage Raise Period~…the amount of time before a normal wage increase at each individual store.
198~D1, D2~V27~Variable~Normal Wage Raise~…the usual amount of raises that an employee will earn at the time of normal wage increase at each individual store.
198~D1, D2~M4~Methodology~Linear~…reports the average changes between waves 1 and 2 for the normal wage raise period and the normal wage raise, as well as regression coefficients from models that include the wage-gap variable.
198~D1, D2~F18~Findings~Average Normal Wage Raise Period Relative Change~…although the average time to the first pay raise increased by 2.5 weeks in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania, the increase is not statistically significant.
198~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Wage Profile Slope~…measured by the ratio of the typical first raise to the amount of time until the first raise is given.
198~D1, D2~F24~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Wage Profile Slope~…the slope of the wage profile flattened in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with no significant relative difference between states.
198~D1, D2~V28~Variable~Food Prices~…to examine the effect of the minimum wage increase on the prices of meals at fast-food restaurants.
198~D1, D2~V28~Variable~Food Prices~…managers at each surveyed store were asked for the prices of three standard items including a medium soda, a small order of french fries, and a main course.
198~V28~L7~Variable Value~Main Course~…the main course was a basic hamburger at Burger King, Roy Rogers, and Wendy's restaurants, and two pieces of chicken at KfC stores.
198~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Full Meal Price~…defined as the after-tax price of a medium soda, a small order of french fries, and a main course.
198~D1, D2~M5~Methodology~Log-Linear~…reduced-form estimates of the effect of the minimum wage increase on prices with the dependent variable being the logarithm of the price of a full meal at each store and key independent variables include either a dummy indicating whether the store is located in New Jersey or the proportional wage increase required to meet the minimum wage.
198~D1, D2~F19~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Full Meal Price~…the estimated New Jersey dummy shows that after-tax meal prices rose 3.2% faster in New Jersey than in Pennsylvania between February and November 1992, an effect that is attributable to a 2.0% increase in prices in New Jersey and a 1.0% decrease in prices in Pennsylvania; this suggests that most of the burden of the New Jersey minimum-wage increase was felt by customers.
198~D1, D2~F20~Findings~Minimum Wage Increase and Pretax Food Prices~…since the New Jersey sales tax rate fell by 1 percentage point between the waves of the survey, estimates suggest that pretax prices rose 4% faster as a result of the minimum-wage increase in New Jersey, slightly more than the increase needed to pass through the cost increase caused by the minimum wage-hike.

199~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the cleaned dataset contains 36,021 matched records, with observation in each state for the period 1979 to 1980 through 1991 to 1992.
199~D1~V2~Variable~Employment~…taken from the employment status recode in the Current Population Survey
199~D1~V1~Variable~Enrollment~…taken from the major activity in the survey week.
199~D1~M1~Methodology~Logit~…initially reports estimates of minimum-wage effects on the probability of each school/work activity, transforming the coefficients of the equation into derivatives of the probability of each activity with respect to the minimum-wage variable with specifications including the minimum-wage variable, lagged school/work activity, the state unemployment rate for men aged 25 to 64, and the year fixed effects.
199~D1~F1~Findings~Minimum Wage Effects and Lagged Activity Probabilities~…the estimated coefficients of the lagged activity variables were strongly signficant in the initial logit model with coefficients equalling -0.12 for SNE, -0.13 for SE, 0.13 for NSE, and 0.17 for NSNE, indicating that minimum wages significantly reduce the probability of enrollment, have a small negative effect on the probability of employment and have a significant positive effect on the probability of being NSNE.
199~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the May month of the Current Population Survey is utilized to increase comparability with earlier research on the topic.
199~D1~T1~Time Period~1979-1991~…includes 1979 to 1980 through 1991 to 1991 with the exception of the survey period 1985 to 1986 because the household identifier changed.
199~D1~F2~Findings~Minimum Wage and Activity Probabilities With State-Level Fixed Effects ~…with the addition of state-level fixed effect dummy variables, the estimated effects of minimum wages on the probabilities of the alternative school/work activities experience little changes equalling -0.11 for SNE, -0.31 for SE, 0.21 for NSE, and 0.21 for NSNE, but because of larger standard errors, the estimated effect on the SNE probability is no longer signficant.
199~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Year Fixed Effects~…these dummy variables eliminate much of the influence of changes in the federal minimum wage.
199~D1~F3~Findings~Minimum Wage and Activity Probabilities With Year Fixed Effects~…with the addition of year fixed effects, only the estimated effects on the SE and NSNE probabilities remain significant at -0.23 and 0.18, respectively.
199~D1~F4~Findings~Current Minimum Wage and Activity Probabilities~…when the lagged minimum-wage variable is substituted for the current one, the estimated effects on the probabilities of three of the four activities are larger with SE increasing in magnitude from -0.23 to -0.39, NSE increasing in magnitude from 0.23 to 0.26 and NSNE increasing in magnitude from 0.18 to 0.23, with only SE and NSNE remaining signifcant.
199~D1~F5~Findings~Minimum Wage and Lagged Activity Interaction Impact~…when the interactions between lagged activities and the minimum wage are added the estimates are little changed, and the more restrictive specification cannot be rejected.
199~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Lagged Activity and Minimum Wage~…an interaction variable added to the final variation of the logit model between lagged individual activities and the minimum wage variable.
199~D1~M1~Methodology~Logit~…it is important to interpret the magnitudes of the coefficients as a result of the logit model in terms of elasticities.
199~D1~F6~Findings~Elasticity of NSNE on Minimum Wage~…the estimated partial derivative of the probability of being NSNE with respect to the minimum-wage variable is 0.23; since the mean of the minimum-wage variable is 0.43, and the mean proportion NSNE is 0.085, the elasticity is 1.16, thuse the effect of a 10% increase in the minimum wage is to increase the proportion NSNE by 11.6%.
199~D1~M1~Methodology~Logit~…secondly, researchers calculate the implied partial derivative of the probability of each school/work transition with respect to the minimum-wage variable using the estimates from the initial logit model with the specification where lagged minimum-wage is substituted for the current one.
199~D1~F7~Findings~Minimum Wage Impact for SNE Individuals~…for those originally SNE, minimum wages significantly reduce the probability of becoming SE by 0.29 and significantly increase the probability of becoming NSNE by 0.21, the former suggesting that individuals who are origianlly SNE do not displace lower-wage workers by switching to SE, while the latter is consistent with individuals leaving school to queue for minimum-wage jobs.
199~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Lagged Activity~…influences minimum-wage effects in calculating implied partial derivatives of the probability of each school/work transition with respect to the minimum-wage variable because it alters the point of the distribution at which the probability of each activity is evaluated.
199~D1~F8~Findings~Minimum Wage Impact for SE Individuals~…for those originally SE, the probability of remaining in this activity is significantly reduced by the minimum wage by 0.56, while there is a large and significant effect of the minimum wage on the probability of becoming NSE by 0.39, suggesting that individuals originally SE displace minimum-wage or lower-wage workers, if their hours increase when they leave school.
199~D1~F9~Findings~Transitional Average Weekly Hours~…researchers find that average weekly hours of individuals who switched from SE to NSE increased from 19.0 to 30.8, whereas average weekly hours of those who did not switch increased only from 16.3 to 17.6.
199~D1~F10~Findings~Likelihood of SE to NSNE Transition~…for those originally SE, there is a significant and positive effect of 0.13 on becoming NSNE due to the minimum wage, possibly reflecting individuals leaving school to take a full-time minimum-wage job, and subsequently becoming unemployed.
199~D1~F11~Findings~Minimum Wage Impact for NSE Individuals~…for those originally NSE, there is a positive and significant effect of the minimum wage on the probability of becoming NSNE with magnitude 0.19, an effect that is consistent with substitution away from previously employed workers in response to a minimum-wage increase.
199~D1~F12~Findings~Minimum Wage Impact on Education Return~…for those originally NSE, the minimum wage makes these individuals less likely to return to school, significantly so in the case of the SE activity with a coefficient of -0.33
199~D1~F13~Findings~Minimum Wage Impact on NSNE Individuals ~…for those that are originally NSNE, the minimum wage has a significant positive effect on the probability of remaining in this activity with a positive coefficient of 0.49, and a significant negative effect on the probability of returning to school with a coefficient of -0.28 on SNE and -0.19 on SE
199~D1~F14~Findings~Likelihood of NSE to NSNE Transition~…the estimated effect on the probability of going from NSE to NSNE is 0.19 with the mean proportion making this transition equalling 0.12, thus the elasticity is 0.68.
199~V5~L5~Variable Value~16-17 years~…the younger age group to calculate separate estimates on the effects of minimum wage on activity probability to determine whether age is a proxy for quality.
199~V5~L6~Variable Value~18-19 years~…the older age group to calculate separate estimates on the effects of minimum wage on activity probability to determine whether age is a proxy for quality.
199~D1~F15~Findings~Minimum Wage Impacts on Younger Individuals~…for 16 to 17-year-olds, researchers found smaller effect of minimum wages on the probability of transitions from SNE or SE to NSE, and, for those originally NSE, larger effects on the probability of becoming NSNE.
199~D1~F16~Findings~Minimum Wage Impacts on Older Individuals~…for 18 to 19-year-olds, researchers found much larger effects than 16 to 17-year-olds on the probability of going from SE to NSE, and smaller effects on the probability of going from Nse to NSNE, results that are consistent with substitution toward older, high-quality workers.
199~D1~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the final set of estimates distinguishes the effects of minimum wages for individuals originally above or below a new minimum wage; due to data constraints, the specification is altered slightly, using the current minimum wage and comparing it to the individual's lagged wage, with the sample being restricted to individuals working for a wage in their first year, and for whom wages are reported ultimately reducing the sample to one-ninth of its original size.
199~D1~M1~Methodology~Logit~…the final set of estimates includes a dummy variable for a wage below the minimum wage and also includes an interaction of this variable with the minimum-wage variable.
199~D1~F17~Findings~Minimum Wage Impact on Probability of Becoming Unemployed~…for workers below the new minimum, minimum wages increase the probability of becoming NSNE for workers initially either SE or NSE by 0.22 and 0.50, respectively.
199~D1~F18~Findings~Substitution Hypothesis Confirmation~…for those individuals earning at or above the new minimum wage, there are no significant effects of minimum wages on the probability of becoming NSNE, however the substitution hypothesis predicts that some of SE individuals leave school to become full-time workers, with an estimated effect for this transition being 0.44, but not signifcant.
316~316: The New Economic of Teaching and Education~~~~
316~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~…the rate of increase in direct costs of elementary and secondary education has been much larger and of much longer duration than the well-known explosion in direct costs of college education in the United States. From 1960 to 1990, the per-student costs of higher education increased by about 50% in real terms. In cntrast, elementary and high schol costs per student increased by about 150%, roughly three times as much.
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~…average annual per-student expenditures in elementary and secondary schools represented 6.4% and 12.0% of median family income in 1960. By 1990 these figures climbed to 11.7% and 17.8%, respectively.
316~D5~V1~Variable~Staff-to-Student Ratios~…the large rise in costs of precollege education have been driven by sharp increases in staff-to-student ratios. They have nearly doubled in the lsast 30 years. The growth in the teacher-student ratio alone accounts for over 60% of the increase in school costs since 1960. Teaching services purchased per student climbed steadily throughout the period despite dramatic demographic movements in school enrollments and labor market activities of women.
316~D5~V2~Variable~Aggregate School Enrollment~…aggregate school enrollment fluctuated by 17% from 1960 to 1990.
316~D2~V3~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…female labor force participation rates nearly doubled from 1960 to 1990.
316~D1, D2, D3~V4~Variable~Number of Females Graduating College~…the number of females graduation college increased by about 500%.
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~…this article examines how young women's labor force commitments and human capital investment activity influence the market for teachers and ultimately, the cost of precollege schooling.
316~D2~V3~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…stronger labor market commitments of women increase the demand for teachers and allied staff, as purchased school services were substituted for household-proudced child services.
316~D2~V5~Variable~Real Earnings~…since teaching is a predominantly female profession, greater market opportunities for women raise the supply price of teaching.
316~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Future Life-Cycle Work Intensity~…an economic structure that focuses on anticpated future life-cycle work intensity is central studying female labor supplied to teaching, since female teachers spend considerably more time out of the labor force, than other college graduates.
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…in National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data, female teachers spent 42% more time out of the labor force than other female college graduates and well over twice that of male college graduates.
316~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Flexibility Value~"…it is known that leaving and reentering the teaching profession is a fairly common practice and that only a small percentage of entrants to the filed in any given year are new to the profession. Less is known about whether teaching provides more flexible movement between the market and home sector relative to other occupations and if this ""flexibility"" option is valued."
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the model is applied to NLSY female college graduates to determine whether transitions between the home and market sector are less costly for female teachers than for other female graduates.
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the model is applied to NLSY female college graduates to determine whether transitions between the home and market sector are less costly for female teachers than for other female graduates.
316~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Wage Penalties for Time Spent OLF~…teachers do not suffer wage penalties for time spent out of the labor market, while other college graduates (including female-dominated nursing and administrative support staff occupations) take wage hits of roughly 9% for each year spent out of the market sector. The estimated value of the flexibility option in teaching ranges between one-half to a full year's income, depending on the assumed discount rate and life-cycle work profile.
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~…real costs of elementary and secondary education increased by 300% between 1960 and 1990. Rising teaching costs were the largest contributor to increasing costs, because the education industry is so labor intensive.
316~D2~V5~Variable~Real Earnings~…real instruction costs more than tripled during the relevant period, accounting for over 62% of the increase in total costs.
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~...administration costs for elementary schools were more than six times greater in 1990 than in 1960. For secondary schools they were more than seven times greater. Expenditures devoted to student health, attendance, speech pathology, and other student services increased more than 10-fold during the 30-year period. Administrative and other school service costs accounted for approximately 14% of total elementary and secondary school costs in 1990 but for only 3% in 1960. Costs associated with nonlabor inputs grew more modestly. Imputed rent and depreciation accounted for nearly 19% of total direct costs in 1960 but fell to less than 11% in 1990. The relative share of costs attributable to plant operations and maintenance remained constant over the period at about 9% in both 1960 and 1990. Roughly 60% of plant operations and maintenance costs in both 1960 and 1990 are attributable to labor inputs.
316~D5~V2~Variable~Aggregate School Enrollment~…aggregate school enrollment increased during the time period. However, changes in the size of the school-age population account for less than 9% of the increase in real costs.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~T1~Time Period~1960-1990~…the relevant time period of study for the current research paper.
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~…the main cause of the increase in expenditures per student was rising school staffs.
316~D5~V1~Variable~Staff-to-Student Ratios~…the total staff-student ratio more than doubled between 1960 and 1990, with the majority of this growth occuring between 1960 and 1980. The largest increase was for support staff and other instructional staff, including guidance counselors and teacher aides. However, the ratio of classroom teachers to students also increased sharply, by some 60%. The rise in the teacher-student ratio is a continuation of a trend that started at the turn of the century. Special education and disability accomodation isn the public schools contribute only slightly to the trend in the teacher-student ratio.
316~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the link between rising female labor force participation rates and the changing classroom dynamic of greater student exposure to teachers, teacher assistants, and school counselors is examined with state data between 1975 and 1990.
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the link between rising female labor force participation rates and the changing classroom dynamic of greater student exposure to teachers, teacher assistants, and school counselors is examined with state data between 1975 and 1990. Evidence of the relationship between the teacher-pupil ratio and labor force participation rates for women is avilable from estimating a regression of the change in the teacher-pupil ratio in period t and state s on the change in labor force participation rates of females ages 20 to 50 in state s. This regression also includes a constant term ([beta](0)) and an error term. Equation (1).
316~D1, D3, D5~F2~Findings~Labor Force Participation, Flexibility and Teacher-Pupil Ratios~…substitution between home and public sector children inputs implies that teacher-pupil ratios increase more when increases in labor force participation rates for women are greatest. The coefficient estimate is .0364 and is significant at the 1% level. The simple correlation coeffiicent for the change in labor force participation rates and the change in teacher-pupil ratio is .322. This result is consistent with substition of staff and teacher time in school for parental time at home in the production of child services. States that experienced greater growth in female labor force participation experienced greater growth in purchased teaching services. According to the estimates, the elasticity of teachers per student to female labor force participation rates ranged between 0.3 and 0.5.  However due to fertility trends and how female labor force participation affects family income, there are other plausible reasons for the positive correlation. The finding that changes in female labor force participation rates are positively related to changes in the teacher-pupil ratio is robust across specifications.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~V6~Variable~Time Period~…t refers to the time period (each period is a 5-year interval, eg., 1975-80).
316~D2~T2~Time Period~1975-1990~…the link between rising female labor force participation rates and the changing classroom dynamic of greater student exposure to teachers, teacher assistants, and school counselors is examined with state data between 1975 and 1990.

316~D1, D2, D3, D5~V6~Variable~Time Period~…there are three time periods of interest used in the regressional analysis in the current research.
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…there are 50 states and three time periods, or 150 observations overall.
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the baseline regression equation is augmented to control for enrollment, income, union and time effects. Additional explanatory variables in this specification inclde the change in the state's average daily attendance during the period, the change in the state's median family income, the percentage cahnge in unionized teachers in the state, and a time-period-shift parameter common to all states. Equation (2).
316~D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Change in Average Daily Attendance~…the change in the state's average daily attendance during the period included in the second specification of the regression model.
316~D5~DV7~Derived Variable~Change in Median Family Income~…the change in the state's median family income.
316~D2, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Change in Unionized Teachers~…the percentage change in unionized teachers in the state.
316~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Time-Period-Shift Parameters~…a time-period-shift parameter common to all states
316~D1, D3, D5~F3~Findings~Labor Force Participation and Teacher-Pupil Ratios~…according to estimates of equation (2), shifts in participation rates accounted for approximately 22% of the rise in the teacher-pupil ratio on average. This number increases to over 30% when time dummies are excluded from the equation, since the effect of the average increase in participation rates for the period is incorporated in the period shift parameter. In tother words, roughly a third of the increase in teacher-pupil ratios during the 1975-90 period is explained by substitution of public sector inputs for diminished household time inputs.  Conversely, increases in teacher unionization explain less than 1% of the change in the teacher-pupil ratio on average. The coefficient on the change in the level of unionized teachers is not only small and insignificant, but gains in union coverage were minimal during the period. The coefficient on median family income is significant across specifications, as income effects explain about 6% of the increase in teacher services per student during the 15-year period.
316~D2, D3~DV8~Derived Variable~Change in Unionized Teachers~…although changes in union coverage did not explain growth in purchased teacher services, union penetration is correlated with cross-sectional differences in states' teacher-pupil ratios.
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…estimates of the third specification illustrates the relation between union coverage and teacher-pupil ratio levels where C(0) is a constant, D(s) is the state fixed effects, and e(ts) is the unexplained part of the ratio of teachers-to-pupils. Equation (3).
316~D1, D3, D5~F4~Findings~Teacher Unionization, Labor Force Participation, and Teacher-Pupil Ratios~…the coefficient on teacher unionization is significant at the 5% level in two of the specifications and is significant at the 10% level in the third specification. The coefficient on female labor force participation is significant at the 1% level in all specifications. The statistical relation between female labor force participation rates and teacher-pupil ratios is so strong that the R-squared statistic is .27 in specification (5). In comparison, when only the state teacher unionization level and a constant are included on the right-hand side of the equation, the R-squared statistic is approximately .005. Although the coefficient on unionization is positive and significant, it explains only a small portion of the cross-sectional difference in state teacher-pupil ratios.
316~D3~D3~Dataset~National Education Association~…the National Education Association (NEA) reports that union coverage during this 15-year period increased from around 88% to 91%. The within-state changes closely mirror changes in the national average.
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the fourth specification includes changes in the labor force participation rates of females, the change in unionized teachers, the change in median family income, the change in average daily attendance, and time dummies as explanatory variables. Equation (4).
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the fifth specification includes only a constant and the labor force participation rate on the right-hand side.
316~D1, D3, D5~F5~Findings~Correlation Between Labor Force Participation and Teacher-Pupil Ratios~…the correlation between teacher-pupil ratios and female labor force participation rates is approximately .52. This correlation is quite robust, even if the common upward trend in both series is ignored by examining the 50-state cross section during a single period (e.g., 1980, 1985, or 1990), the simple correlation is still about .3. Female labor force participation rates explain both the level and growth in states' teacher-pupil ratios and thus are closely linked to costs of school services.
316~D1, D3, D5~F6~Findings~Correlation Between State Unionization Levels and Teacher Pupil Ratios~…the correlation between state unionization levels and teacher-pupil ratios is positive but of rather small magnitude at .07. State unionization level is much more closely related to state income levels. The correlation between median family income in the state and union coverage is .4. Teacher unions tend to organize in high-income states. The correlation between median income levels and female labor force participation is .28. School enrollment is strongly negatively correlated with participation rates, as enrollment is a proxy for fertility. The correlation matrix indicates that females in high-income states are more likley to participate in the formal market sector, have fewer children, and purchase more school services.
316~D5~V2~Variable~Aggregate School Enrollment~…this measure is a proxy for fertility.
316~D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Child Services~…time series on enrollment in child services during the last several decades.
316~DV10~L1~Variable Value~4 year-olds in Private Schools~…the enrollment of 4-year-olds in private nursery schools.
316~DV10~L2~Variable Value~3 year-olds in Private School~…the enrollment of 3-year-olds in private nursery schools.
316~DV10~L3~Variable Value~4 year-olds in Public Schools~…the enrollment of 4-year-olds in public nursery schools.

316~DV10~L9~Variable Value~3 year-olds in Full-Day Preprimary~…the enrollment of 3-year-olds in full-day preprimary programs.
316~DV10~L10~Variable Value~5 year-olds in Full-Day Preprimary~…the percentage of 5-year-olds enrolled in full-day preprimary programs.
316~DV10~L11~Variable Value~4 year-olds in Full-Day Preprimary~…the percentage of 4-year-olds enrolled in full-day preprimary programs.
316~DV10~L12~Variable Value~3 year-olds in Full-Day Preprimary~…the percentage of 3-year-olds enrolled in full-day preprimary programs.
316~D5~F7~Findings~Child Services Trends~…use of preprimary programs exploded, as the utilization of these services increased over fivefold between 1965 and 1990, measured either in absolute or in percentage terms. The employment of these child services increased not only on the extensive margin, but usage also increased on the intensive margin. There was nearly a 400% increase in the portion of 5-year-olds enrolled in full-day preprimary programs in just a 20-year period. There has been a clear and fundamental shift toward purchased market inputs in the provision of children's educational services.
316~V1~L13~Variable Value~Teacher-Pupil Ratio~…acceleration in the growth of teacher pupil ratios in recent decades was fueld by intensive hiring of young teachers in the 1960s and 1970s.
316~D2~V3~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…rising female labor force participation rates increase the demand for school services and also raise the market opportunity costs for female teachers.
316~D2~V5~Variable~Real Earnings~…plots real average salaries (excluding fringe benefits) over the 1967-89 period for employed elementary and secondary school teachers and for other college graduates from the March CPS.
316~D2~V5~Variable~Real Earnings~…over the period from 1967 to 1989, real earnings for teachers followed the well-documented pattern for all college graduates, declining during the 1970s and rebounding during the 1980s.
316~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Relative Earnings Trends and Demographics~…the average earnings of teachers increased relative to average earnings of college graduates between 1967 and 1989. However virtual changes in the demographic composition of the teaching and college graduate workforce accounts for virtually all of this: average education and experience levels increased more for teachers than for other college graduates.
316~D1, D2~V8~Variable~Age~…the NEA reports that the median age for female teachers in 1976 and 1986 was 33 and 41, respectively. According to CPS data average age for female secondary teachers was 35.9 in 1974 and 41.4 in 1987.
316~D3~D3~Dataset~National Education Association~…the NEA reports that the median age for female teachers in 1976 and 1986 was 33 and 41, respectively.
316~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…according to CPS data average age for female secondary teachers was 35.9 in 1974 and 41.4 in 1987.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…consider a wage equation where the dependent variable is the logarithm of earnings of an individual (i) in year t and explanatory variables include a vector X(it) that controls for education, race, standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA), and an experience cubic. This equation is estimated separately each year (between 1967 and 1989) for female college graduates and female teachers using CPS data.
316~D2~T3~Time Period~1967-1989~…the relevant survey period from which earnings data from the Current Population Survey is drawn.
316~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…wage equations are estimated separately each year (between 1967 and 1989) for female college graduates and female teachers using CPS data.
316~V5~L14~Variable Value~Average College~…the average earnings of college graduates throughout the relevant time series.
316~V5~L15~Variable Value~Average Secondary~…the average earnings of secondary teachers throughout the relevant time series.
316~V5~L16~Variable Value~Average Primary~…the average earnings of primary teachers throughout the relevant time series.
316~D2~V5~Variable~Real Earnings~…the logarithm of the earnings of individual (i) in year t as the dependent variable in log wage regressions.
316~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…a vector including controls for education, race, standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA), and an experience cubic.
316~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Education~…the education level of a CPS respondent as included in a demographic control vector in log wage regressions.
316~D1, D2~V10~Variable~Race~…the race of a CPS respondent as included in a demographic control vector in log wage regressions.
316~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area~…the standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) of a CPS respondent as included in a demographic control vector in log wage regressions.

316~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Projected Constant-Weight Log Earnings~…a fixed demographic vector is combined with the time varying regression coefficient estimates to project constant-weight log earnings in each year.
316~DV11~L17~Variable Value~X(elem, 1967)~…the mean demographic values for female elementary teachers in 1967.
316~DV11~L18~Variable Value~X(sec, 1967)~…the mean demographic values for female secondary school teachers in 1967.
316~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~"…although 1967 is chosen as the ""mean"" year, similar results are obtained when the X's are measured at their 1976 and 1989 means."
316~D1, D2, D4~F9~Findings~Relative Earnings Trends for Elementary Educators and Quality Trends~…during the entire period, the decline in relative wages was over 15% for elementary school teachers. The fall in the relative wage of teachers assumes that unobserved quality of teachers has remained constant. There is a little evidence to the contrary. The NLS young women survey provides IQ scores for 230 female college graduates in 1970, ranging in age from 21 to 26. There are 104 teachers in this group, and their average rank is at the 53rd percentile of all female graduates. The NLSY provides Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) scores for 1,064 female college graduates in 1991, ranging in age from 26 to 33. Female teachers in the 1991 cohort ranked at the 42nd percentile.
316~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Earnings~…the wages of teachers relative to the wages of all college graduates.
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY provides Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) scores for 1,064 female college graduates in 1991.
316~D1~V12~Variable~AFQT Score~…the NLSY provides Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) scores for 1,064 female college graduates in 1991.
316~D4~D4~Dataset~NLS Young Women Survey~…the NLS young women survey provides IQ scores for 230 female college graduates in 1970, ranging in age from 21 to 26.
316~D4~V13~Variable~IQ~…the NLS young women survey provides IQ scores for 230 female college graduates in 1970, ranging in age from 21 to 26.
316~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…it is important to use a fixed X vector to project log earnings across years for teachers and other college graduates because the slopes of their age-earning profiles differ greatly.
316~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Projected Constant-Weight Log Earnings~…it is important to use a fixed X vector to project log earnings across years for teachers and other college graduates because the slopes of their age-earning profiles differ greatly.
316~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Experience Cubic~…an experience cubic is included in a log wage regression estimated separately on female teachers and female nonteachers. It includes controls for hours worked per year, race, SMSA, education, and year effects.
316~D2~V5~Variable~Real Earnings~…average earnings profiles in the figure are generated for whites who live in an SMA and work 2,000 hours per year.
316~D2~V14~Variable~Hours Worked Per Year~…hours worked per year as used in computing an experience cubic for each relevant respondent of the CPS.
316~D1, D2~V10~Variable~Race~…race as used in computing an experience cubic for each relevant respondent of the CPS.
316~D1, D2~V11~Variable~Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area~…the SMSA of residence as used in computing an experience cubic for each relevant respondent of the CPS.
316~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Education~…education as used in computing an experience cubic for each relevant respondent of the CPS.
316~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Year Effects~…year effects per year as used in computing an experience cubic for each relevant respondent of the CPS.
316~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Earnings Profiles of College Graduates vs. Teachers~…female college graduates have much steeper earnings profiles than teachers, so relative earnings differences increase both in absolute and in percentage terms with experience in the interval between the two arrows.
316~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…if a time-varying X vector is used to project earnings (such as teacher's mean X's in each year), then estimated relativewages of teachers will change just because different points in the profile are being compared.
316~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Relative Earnings~…if a time-varying X vector is used to project earnings (such as teacher's mean X's in each year), then estimated relativewages of teachers will change just because different points in the profile are being compared.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~T4~Time Period~1950-1990~…teaching was far and away the most frequently chosen ocupation by female college graduates 30 years ago, attracting nearly 50% of them. By 1990 the percentage had dropped well below 10%. Although this downward trend is evident in the 1960s and early 1970s, it accelerated after 1972. At the same time the number of female college graduates increased nearly sixfold between 1950 and 1990.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~T5~Time Period~1955-1970~…enrollment in elementary schools peaked in 1970 at nearly 37 million students, up 38% from just 15 years earlier. In that same period the number of elementary teachers grew by 55% from 827,000 to nearly 1.3 mllion. The number of females graduation college climbed 236% between 1955 and 1970, though it was relatively flat for many years preceding 1955.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~T1~Time Period~1960-1990~…nearly 85% of elementary teachers in 1990 were female. This percentage has changed little over the last several decades, even with the recent decline in relative wages of female teachers and the large inflows of female graduates into other occupations.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M3~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers analyze female attachment to the teaching profession with a model that emphasizes uncertainty about occupational outcomes, anticipated future household production and varying rates of human capital depreciation across jobs. The model shows that the particular occupation that maximizes expected life-cycle earnings depends on expected work-life intensity.
316~D2~V3~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…the supply reaction of more women graduation college (in response to higher demand for teaching services) reinforces upward pressures on the demand for teachers, since changes in female labor force participation rates are positively related to changes in teacher-pupil ratios.
316~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Future Life-Cycle Work Intensity~…if uncertainty exists with respect to potential wages in different job matches, and search costs are not strongly dependent on future work intensity, individuals who expect to devote less time to market activity in the future will act as if they are more risk averse in choosing an initial occupation. The reason is that gains from wage search are greatest for individuals who expect to work the most hours over their life cycle, assuming equivalent initial human capital endowments, human capital accumulation technologies, and search costs. 
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~V6~Variable~Time Period~…in the occupational attachment model there are two time periods.
316~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Occupation~…in the occupational attachment model there are two groups of occupations. Individuals know their potential earnings in one occupational group with certainty but are uncertain about their potential earnings in the other group.
316~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Potential Earnings~…potential earnings within an occupational group are determined by the product of the wage rate and the person's units of human capital.
316~D2~V17~Variable~Wage Rate~…potential earnings within an occupational group are determined by the product of the wage rate and the person's units of human capital.
316~D1, D2~DV17~Derived Variable~Units of Human Capital~…potential earnings within an occupational group are determined by the product of the wage rate and the person's units of human capital.
316~V17~L21~Variable Value~Uncertain Wage Rate~…refers to an individual's wage rate in the group with the uncertain outcome.
316~V17~L22~Variable Value~Known Wage Rate~…refers to an individual's wage rate in the group with the known outcome.
316~V16~L19~Variable Value~High-Variance Occupation~…the high-variance occupation is referred to as h.
316~V16~L20~Variable Value~Low-Variance Occupation~…the low-variance occupation is referred to as l.
316~D1, D2~DV16~Derived Variable~Potential Earnings~…in the absence of occupational mobility, expected earnings associated with entering one of these occupations is computed.
316~DV16~L23~Variable Value~Expected Earnings in Occupation h~…the expected earnings in occupation h takes into account the probability density functin of prospective wage in the high-variance function and the fraction of time devoted to work activity in addition to the wage rate and units of human capital.
316~DV16~L24~Variable Value~Expected Earnings in Occupation l~…the expected earnings in occupation l takes into account the fraction of time devoted to work activity in addition to the wage rate and units of human capital.
316~D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Wage Probability Density Function~…the probability density function of prospective wage in the high-variance occupation.
316~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Fraction of Work Time~…the fraction of time devoted to work activity.
316~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Investments in Human Capital~…investments in human capital are made in the first period.
316~V6~L25~Variable Value~First Period~…investments in human capital are made in the first period.
316~V6~L26~Variable Value~Second Period~…work occurs in the second period.
316~D1, D2~DV17~Derived Variable~Units of Human Capital~…the person's human capital stock is determined by a function involving the amount invested in human capital (I) , k(I) the usual human capital investment function, with k'(I) > 0 and k''(I) < 0, and q is the human capital depreciation. K = (1 - q (1 - [theta]))k(I).
316~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Investments in Human Capital~…I is the amount invested in human capital.
316~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Usual Human Capital Investment Function~…k(I) is the usual human capital investment function, with k'(I)>0 and k''(I)<0.
316~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Human Capital Depreciation Rate~…q is the human capital depreciation rate.
316~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Occupation~…occupational mobility is included by allowing individuals to switch occupational groups once.
316~D3, D5~V21~Variable~Occupation Move Cost~…the cost associated with an occuaptional move is C.
316~V16~L19~Variable Value~High-Variance Occupation~…assume for simplicity that uncertainty of outcome in occupation h is resolved immediately on entering it.
316~V16~L20~Variable Value~Low-Variance Occupation~…assume for simplicity that experience in occupation l provides no information in h.
316~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Net Earnings of Entry~…the expected net earnings of initially entering occupation l and h.
316~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Expected Net Earnings of Entry~…income maximization requires entry into occupation h if V(h) > V(l).
316~V17~L21~Variable Value~Uncertain Wage Rate~…the person stays in the risky occupation only if the R(h) realized ex post is greater than the reservation wage s.
316~V16~L19~Variable Value~High-Variance Occupation~…the person stays in the risky occupation only if the R(h) realized ex post is greater than the reservation wage s.
316~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Reservation Wage~…as usual, the reservation wage is defined such that earnings associated with staying in occupation h equals prospective earnings associated with leaving it.
316~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Reservation Wage~…the reservation wage depends on human capital stock, the fraction of time devoted to market activity, the depreciation rate, the wage rate in the low variance occupation, and the cost of switching occupational groups.
316~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…in the occupational attachment model, there are two groups of individuals with identical distributions of individual characteristics.
316~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Fraction of Work Time~…in the occupational attachment model, one group supplies a larger fraction of their time to nonmarket activity ([theta] is lower). The effect of a lower [theta] for one group results in lower average human capital investments and a lower propensity to choose the high-variance occupation.
316~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Difference in Expected Net Earnings of Entry~…the increasing propensity to choose the high-variance occupation h as [theta] increases is illustrated by subtracting net earnings in l from expected net earnings in h and differentiating the result with respect to [theta]. The difference between the high and low variance earnings equations must be positive in order for individuals to initially enter the high-variance occupation, and the difference is increasing in [theta].
316~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Fraction of Work Time~…larger values of [theta] in a population are associated with larger propensities to enter high-variance occupations. Greater commitment to the workforce promotes incentives to enter riskier occupations, other things being equal.
316~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Human Capital Depreciation Rate~…the occupational attachment model is expanded to incorporate varying human capital depreciation rates by allowing both occupational groups to consist of jobs that vary in q where v is an error term reflecting wage uncertainty in the high-variance occupational group.
316~D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Wage Uncertainty~…an error term reflecting wage uncertainty in the high-variance occupational group.
316~D2~V17~Variable~Wage Rate~…the wage and human capital depreciation rate are positively related, since jobs with higher q must offer higher gross returns to attract workers.
316~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Human Capital Depreciation Rate~…the wage and human capital depreciation rate are positively related, since jobs with higher q must offer higher gross returns to attract workers.
316~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Future Life-Cycle Work Intensity~…differences in life-cycle work intensity imply that females will be disproportionately located in jobs with with lower q.
316~D1~V22~Variable~Wage of Last Job~…the wage of an NLSY respondent's last job in 1991 dollars.
316~D1~DV24~Derived Variable~Log Wage Difference~…the log wage difference of an NLSY respondent's first and last job.
316~D1~V23~Variable~OLF~…the years an NLSY respondent has been out of the labor force.
316~D1~V24~Variable~Occupational Tenure~…the occupation tenure of an NLSY respondent in years.
316~D1, D2~V27~Variable~Work Experience~…the work experience of an NLSY respondent after college graduation.
316~D1~V25~Variable~Percentage Black~…the percentage of NLSY respondents that are black.
316~D1~V26~Variable~Percentage Not in SMSA~…the percentage of NLSY respondents that do not live in an SMSA (in the last year observed).
316~D1, D2~V9~Variable~Education~…the educaton level of an NLSY respondent.
316~D1, D2~V8~Variable~Age~…the age of an NLSY respondent.
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…college graduates from the 1979-91 NLSY with no more than 18 years of education, who worked at least 500 hours in any year after graduation, and who earned hourly wage rates between $3 and $50 (1990 dollars) form the data set.
316~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Female vs. Male OLF~…female college graduates, whether in teaching or not, spend considerably more time out of the labor force than male college graduates (nearly double the time for a sample with an average age of 30). But female teachers on average spend 42% more time out of the labor force than female college graduates in other occupations. Despite the longer portion of time spent out of the labor force, teachers have higher levels of occupation tenure than either male or other female college graduates.
316~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Occupational Mobility by Initial Period Occupation~"…there is less occupational switching by persons who initially enter teaching after graduation, compared with graduates who initially enter other fields. Roughly 60% of women who entered teaching after college did not switch two-digit occupations as of the last year they were observed in the survey, compared with 25% for other female college graduates and 21% for male college graduates. This is a dramatic difference, especially in light of the fact that teachers in the sample are both older and more experienced than other college graduates and thus had greater opportunity (more ""exposure to the hazard"") to switch careers. Higher levels of occupational mobility may indicate greater uncertainty associated with the initial choice, or it may just result from poor classification of occupational categories."
316~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Occupation~…higher levels of occupational mobility in the estimates may indicate greater uncertainty associated with the initial choice, or it may just result from poor classification of occupational categories. For example, individuals may enter career paths after college that involve switching two-digit occupationally coded jobs but represent nothing more than well-anticipated career promotional tracks. Such distinctions cannot be pursued with these data.
316~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Human Capital Depreciation Rate~…the higher propensity of teachers to take leaves from work suggests that teaching has relatively low rates of human capital depreciation, since individuals with lower [theta] rationally choose jobs with lower values of q.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M3~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers estimate relative earnings losses associated with leaving the labor force using first differences to eliminate fixed effects. Here (i) refers to the individual, t is the period when (i) takes her first job after college graduation, t+k is the first period when the last wage is observed, X is a vector of personal characteristics that includes change in education between t and t+k, race, SMSA at t and SMSA at t+k, and a quadratic in occupational tenure and total work experience acquired after college graduation. OLF is time spent out of the labor force measure in years and e(i) is an individual specific error term. Also included in the regression is teacher dummy (T) and the interaction of the teacher dummy with OLF. This equation is estimated on female college graduate only.
316~V6~L27~Variable Value~t+k~…t+k is the period when the last wage is observed.
316~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…in first-difference regressions, X is a vector of personal characteristics that includes change in education between t and t+k, race, SMSA at t and SMSA at t+k, and a quadratic in occupational tenure and total work experience acquried after college graduation.
316~D1~V23~Variable~OLF~…OLF is time spent out of the labor force measured in years.
316~D1~V28~Variable~Teacher~…included in first-difference regressions is a teacher dummy (T).
316~D1~DV25~Derived Variable~Teacher, OLF~…included in first-difference regressions is an interaction term between the teacher dummy with OLF.
316~D1, D2~DV26~Derived Variable~Change in Education~…in first-difference regressions, the change in education between t and t+k is included in a vector of personal characteristics.
316~V11~L28~Variable Value~SMSA at t~…the standard metropolitan statistical area of an NLSY respondent at time t.
316~V11~L29~Variable Value~SMSA at t+k~…the standard metropolitan statistical area of an NLSY respondent at time t+k.
316~D1~V24~Variable~Occupational Tenure~…a quadratic in occupational tenure as included in first-difference regressions.
316~D1, D2~V27~Variable~Work Experience~…a quadratic in total work experience acquired after college graduation as included in first-difference regressions.
316~D1~V28~Variable~Teacher~…in the first first-difference specification column, the teacher dummy is coded as 1 if the individual was a teacher in t+k (the last year in which earnings are observed).
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~F13~Findings~First Differences Regression Results~…in first-difference regressions, the coefficient on OLF is significantly negative. In the first specification it accounted for a 9.5% earnings loss for every year female college graduates spent out of the labor force. The coefficient on the interaction between the teachers dummy and time spent out of the labor force is positive and significant: teachers who spend time out of the labor force are not penalized in future earnings growth. Other female college graduates are penalized substantially. Even though the interaction effect is larger than the coefficient on OLF, it is inappropriate to extrapolate this estimate since only a small portion of sample teachers spent a year or more out of the labor foce. The coefficient on the teachers dummy is significantly negative, indicating that teachers have flatter earnings profiles than female college graduates in other occupation. These results are not greatly affected if males are included in the sample and hold over avariety of specifications. Re-estimating the equation with teahers defined as individuals whose initial and last observed job are both in teaching also yields the result that time in the home sector does not adversely affect earnings growth. However, if the teacher dummy is defined as the first occupation after college (in year t), then the coefficient on the interaction term between OLF and the teachers dummy is no longer significant. Teachers who leave the labor foce and reenter other occupations suffer wage loss for time spent out of the labor force.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M3~Methodology~First Differences~…this regression equation was estimated separately for NLSY nurses and administrative support workers, the other female-dominated occupations among college graduates.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…t is the period when individual (i) starts her initial job after college t+k to the period when the wage is observed again, X is observable human capital characteristics, B is the return on observable human capital, OLF is time spent out of the labor force since the initial period t, b is the wage loss associated with time spent in the home sector, and e is an error term. The error term is decomposed into unobserved human capital Z, with corresponding return a, and an individual time-specific residual error.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M3~Methodology~First Differences~…t is the period when individual (i) starts her initial job after college t+k to the period when the wage is observed again, X is observable human capital characteristics, B is the return on observable human capital, OLF is time spent out of the labor force since the initial period t, b is the wage loss associated with time spent in the home sector, and e is an error term. The error term is decomposed into unobserved human capital Z, with corresponding return a, and an individual time-specific residual error. The individual error term in the log wage difference equation is affected by growth in unobserved human capital.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M3~Methodology~First Differences~…suppose observed and unobserved human capital are positively correlated. Then earnings will fan out over time if (a) individuals with high ability in period t tend to invest more or (b) if the monetary return to human capital increases between t and t+k. This biases the regression estimates if high-quality teachers (relative to college graduates) are the ones spending more time out of the labor force, because the fanning out of cohort earnings distributions exaggerates the ability of teachers to leave and reenter the workforce without penalty.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M2~Methodology~Log Wage~…suppose observed and unobserved human capital are positively correlated. Then earnings will fan out over time if (a) individuals with high ability in period t tend to invest more or (b) if the monetary return to human capital increases between t and t+k. This biases the regression estimates if high-quality teachers (relative to college graduates) are the ones spending more time out of the labor force, because the fanning out of cohort earnings distributions exaggerates the ability of teachers to leave and reenter the workforce without penalty.
316~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Wage Rate Trends and Continuity of Employment in Teaching Occupations~…average starting wage rates of female teachers who leave and reenter the workforce earn $1.15 less than female teachers with continuous careers. Their average last wage observed is $1.22 less than teachers who work continuously. Other female college graduates who leave and reenter the workforce have average starting wages and final observed wages that are $.46 and $1.84 below female graduates with continuous careers. These comparisons indicate that the differences in unobservables between teachers and college graduates who leave the labor force are small, and the potential biases in estimates are likely to be minor.
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY is not a random sample. Elementary school teachers outnumber secondary school teachers by more than 6:1. Elementary school teachers earn substantially less than other female college graduates: in 1988-91 the average hourly wage of elementary teachers under 34 years old in the CPS is approximately $10.35 per hour, within 23 cents per hour of the wages of NLSY teachers. Because of the disproportionate number of elementary teachers in the data, the results found below may not apply to secondary teachers.
316~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in 1988-91 the average hourly wage of elementary teachers under 34 years old in the CPS is approximately $10.35 per hour, within 23 cents per hour of the wages of NLSY teachers.
316~V23~L30~Variable Value~Noncontinuous Career~…an individual is defined as spending extended time in the home sector if she is out of the labor force for 50 weeks or more.
316~D1, D2, D3, D5~M3~Methodology~First Differences~…in comparing the wages of workers who spent extended time in the home sector to wages of workers who had more continuous work careers to examine the differences in the types of teachers and other college graduates who leave and reenter the workforce only women who worked 4 years or more after college graduation are included.
316~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Occupation~…in comparing the wages of workers who spent extended time in the home sector to wages of workers who had more continuous work careers to examine the differences in the types of teachers and other college graduates who leave and reenter the workforce occupational classification is based on the first job after college where reported hours worked are greater than 500.
316~V23~L31~Variable Value~Continuous Career~…continuous career means that the individual was out of the labor force for less than 50 weeks.
316~V23~L30~Variable Value~Noncontinuous Career~…noncontinuous career means that the individual was out of the labor force for 50 weeks or more.
316~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Flexibility Value~…the estimated value of the flexibility option in teaching depends on the timing and length of anticipated leaves from the workforce, the discount rate, the life-cycle earnings profile, and the dynamics of wage losses.
316~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Flexibility Value~…the calculations are made for continuous spells of 2, 3, and 4 consecutive years out of the workforce after teaching for 5 consecutive years and then working uninterruptedly over the remainder of a 40-year career.
316~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Flexibility Value~…the value of the option is estimated as the difference between discounted life-cycle earnings without and with the wage penalty.
316~D1, D2~DV27~Derived Variable~Discounted Life-Cycle Earnings~…discounted life cycle earnings with and without the wage penalty are used in computing the flexibility.
316~D1, D2~V29~Variable~Wage Penalty~…discounted life cycle earnings with and without the wage penalty are used in computing the flexibility.
316~D1, D2~V29~Variable~Wage Penalty~…researchers assume that teachers would have experienced 9.5% short-term wage losses for each year out of the mrket in some other occupation and double the normal growth rate on reentry until wages coverge to the level predicted by the uninterrupted experience profile.
316~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Flexibility Value~…the option value estimates are reported for interest rates of 5% and 10%.
316~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Flexibility Value Estimates~…the flexibility value estimates are $20,100 and $11,800 for a female teacher who spends 3 years out of the labor force. This is 80% of the annual earnings of female teachers under the age of 40 when the interest rate is 5% and a little less than a half a year's earnings when it is 10% or about 5% of discounted life-cycle earnings in both cases. It would be smaller proportion of total human capital value for a 2-year spell and a larger proportion for a 4-year spell.
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…time worked by employed female graudates in the NLSY was nearly 300 hours less in the last observation year than time worked by male graduates.
316~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Annual Hours Worked , Time Spent OLF, and Total Time Worked Over the Life Cycle~…differences in annual hours worked combined with differences in time spent in the home sector yield dramatic differences in the total time worked over the life cycle. Male college graduates work nearly 25% more hours than female graduates over their careers. This calculation assumes that males and females retire at the same age and that differences between young males and females in hours worked and portion of time spent in the home sector remain constant over the entire work life. undoubtedly there are differences by sex in both of these parameters, but discounting reduces most of their economic effects for the younger workers studied here. If this difference in time commitment to the labor market is anticipated by women in college, the model implies that female graduates will tend to choose professions with more certain payoffs.
316~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…CPS data from 1976, 1977, 1980, and 1981 is drawn to investigate where women choose professions with more certain payoffs in response to identifying a difference in time commitment to the labor market relative to males.
316~D2~T2~Time Period~1975-1990~…CPS data from 1976, 1977, 1980, and 1981 is drawn to investigate where women choose professions with more certain payoffs in response to identifying a difference in time commitment to the labor market relative to males.
316~D2~DV28~Derived Variable~Correlation Between Percentage Female and Variation of Wages~…researchers estimate the correlation between percentage female and the coefficeint of variation of wages for all two-digit occupations with at least 25,000 women in them.
316~D2~DV29~Derived Variable~Coefficient of Variation of the Hourly Wage~…the coefficient of vaiation of the hourly wage is estimated using only females in the occuption with at least 16 years of education, who earned at least $2,000 (1990 dollars, worked at least 5 weeks and were between 31 and 34 years old.
316~D2~V30~Variable~Percentage of Females~…the coefficient of variation is regressed on the percentage of females in the occupations for 1976-77 and 1980-81.
316~D1, D2, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the coefficient of variation is regressed on the percentage of females in the occupations for 1976-77 and 1980-81.
316~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Earnings Distributions for Women Based on Gender x-Dominated Occupations~…the earnings distributions of college-educated women who choose occupations with high proportions of females are more concentrated than are earnings distributions of female graduates who choose male-dominated professions. The simple correlation is about -0.4 in both sets of years. There is a hint that the relation between percentage female and the coefficient of variation of wages has weakened somewhat in recent years. Using a similar decomposition on 1989-90 CPS data yields regression estimates that are no longer significant. 
316~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Flexibility Value of Human Capital and of Life-Cycle Earnings~…the value of the flexibility option in teaching for an anticipated 3-year leave is estimated as about 5% of a teacher's human capital value. The value of the flexibility option in teaching is only 3% to 7% of teachers' life-cycle earnings and is not significant for nurses and administrative support staff. These findings suggest that the flexibility option alone does not explain much of the male-female wage differential.
316~D5~DV1~Derived Variable~Cost of Precollege Schooling~…cost estimates are from the U.S. Deparment of Education, National Center for education Statistics (NCES) data.

316~DV1~L32~Variable Value~Instruction Costs~…the NCES reports total number of full-time equivalent (FTE) elementary and secondary teachers, their average earnings, and total instructional costs for public schools. Average earnings for both elementary and secondary teachers are multiplied by the number fo FTE teachers in each sector, and these earnings totals are summed and subtracted from total instructional costs, not accounted for by teacher salaries, are divided between the elementary and secondary sector based on the ratio of aggregate earnings.
316~DV1~L33~Variable Value~Imputed Rent and Depreciation~…the social costs of tax exemptions, forgone rent on school real estate, and depreciation on buildings and equipment are imputed from Cohn and Geske's (1990) estimates of school property values. Researchers assume that capital user costs are 10% of property values. Costs are allocated between elementary and secondary schools based on the relative numbers of classrooms employed, calculated as aggregate enrollment at each level divided by the published student-teach ratio.
316~DV1~L34~Variable Value~Cost of Plant Operation and Maintenance, Adminstrative, and Other School Services~…these costs are taken from the 1993 Digest of Education Statistics on public schools current expenditures. Classrooms employed are also used to allocated these costs by school level. Expenditures on custodial workers are not listed separately from expenditures on nonlabor operation and maintenance inputs in the National Centers for Education Statistics data. An estimate of the labor component of plant operation and maintenance workers by assuming that their annual earnings in any given year equal the average annual earnings for full-time employees in all industries.
316~DV1~L35~Variable Value~Transportation and School Supplies~…estimates of student-paid transportion are extrapolated from cost data on school-provided transportation in the Digest of Eduation Statistics by assuming that students who do not use school-provided services have the same average costs as those who do. Student expenditures on books and school supplies are estimated by assuming that secondary students purchase 12 books a year and that elementary studnets purchase six books a year. The yearly cost per book comes from the National Center for Education Statistics, Statistics of Public school Libraries/Media Centers, assuming that the average cost of a book purchased by elementary or secondary school libraries equals the average cost per book purchased by their students.
316~D5~V1~Variable~Staff-to-Student Ratios~…staff-student ratios are from the NCES Schools and Staffing Surveys. Time-series data are from the National Center of Education Statistics.
316~D5~V1~Variable~Staff-to-Student Ratios~…for about 30 years before the turn of the centur, the teaher-pupil ratio steadily decreased.
316~D3, D5~V31~Variable~Class Size~…the increasing teacher-student ratios (from administrative records) do not translate into equivalently decreasing observed average class size. The National Education Association (NEA) reports 29 pupils per elementary school class in 1961, and 24 in 1991. It reports an average high school class size of 28 in 1961, while the NCES School and Staffing Survey reports an average class size of 22.6 for teachers in departments in 1990-91. These decreases in class size accounts for roughly half the increase in teacher-student ratios. Data from the NEA indicate that teachers' average yearly class workloads have not diminished in recent decades, and that average time spent in class by students did not change. It is impossible to resolve these reporting discrepancies.
316~D2~V3~Variable~Labor Force Participation~…data on female labor force participation rates by state, for the baseline equations, are from the CPS March supplements 1976, 1981, 1986, and 1991.

316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the NLSY data in section III are college graduates with no more than 18 years of education, who worked at least 500 hours in any year after graduation, and who earned wages between $3 and $50 (1990 dollars).
316~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~"…in the decades 1960 to 1980 the NCES reported a separate category called ""fixed costs."" The major components in this category were pension and insurance costs. In order to make cost statistics in these years comparable to 1990 statistics, these costs have to be allocated to other current expenditure categories. These costs are divided between instruction, plant operation and maintenance, adminstrative and other school services costs based on the percentage of the total estimated wage bill that these categories represent."

317~317: The Probability of Finding a Job~~~~
317~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…this paper rexamines duration dependence in the job finding probability, both empirically and theoretically. To start, the author develops a simple model with a single parameter that determines both how the job finding probability varies with unemployment duration and how it varies with aggregate economic conditions. The model's main departure from most existing research is to think of unemployed workers as waiting for labor market conditions to improve, rather than searching for job opportunities. The author then compares the predictions of this model with data, confirming that workers who have been unemployed for longer are less likely to find a job. Moreover, when the aggregate job finding probaiblity is lower, the job finding probability falls uniformly at all unemployment durations. Both predictions are quantitatively consistent with the model.
317~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Expected Lifetime Utility in Employment~…in the current model, unemployed workers continuously compare their lifetime utility in the best available job with their lifetime utility if they remain unemployed. An individual (i) workers if this difference is positive at time t and not if it is negative.
317~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Expected Lifetime Utility in Unemployment~…in the current model, unemployed workers continuously compare their lifetime utility in the best available job with their lifetime utility if they remain unemployed. An individual (i) workers if this difference is positive at time t and not if it is negative.
317~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Difference in Expected Lifetime Utility~…in the current model, unemployed workers continuously compare their lifetime utility in the best available job with their lifetime utility if they remain unemployed. An individual (i) workers if this difference is positive at time t and not if it is negative.
317~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Duration Dependence~…if the difference between lifetime utility in the best available job and the lifetime utility if an job seeker remains unemployed is persistent, this leads to duration dependence in the hazard rate of exiting unemployment, since a newly unemployed worker is more likely to be near the threshold for taking a job than someone who is long term unemployed. The extent of duration dependence is governed by the stochastic process for the difference in utility, which also determines how the average job finding probaiblity varies with economic conditions.
317~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Difference in Expected Lifetime Utility~…the extent of duration dependence is goverened by the stochastic process for this difference, which also determines how the average job finding probability varies with economic conditions.
317~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Difference in Expected Lifetime Utility~…denotes the difference between the expected lifetime utility from taking the best available job for a short interval of time (t, t+dt) and behaving optimally thereafter, and the expected lifetime utility from being unemployed during (t, t+dt) and behaving optimally thereafter.
317~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Expected Lifetime Utility in Employment~…the expected lifetime utility from taking the best available job for a short interval of time (t, t+dt) and behaving optimally thereafter.
317~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Expected Lifetime Utility in Unemployment~…the expected lifetime utility from being unemployed during (t, t+dt) and behaving optimally thereafter.
317~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Value of Working~…delta denotes the instantaneous value of working rather than remaining unemployed.
317~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Value of Working~…the author makes two key assumptions. This instantaneous value of work exists and satisfies d[delta] = [mu]dt + [sigma]dz(i)(t), where the drift [mu] is nonnegative, the standard deviation [sigma] is positive, and z(i)(t) is a standard Brownian motion, with increments that are independent over time and across workers. A deeper model would derive the behavior of the value from the equilibrium of a labor market hit continuously by idiosyncratic shocks and from time-variation in the worker's value of leisure. Here, the author simply assumes that the drift and and standard deviation are common across individuals and constant over time. Second, building on Alvarez and Shimer's (2007) model of rest unemployment, the current work assumes that individual (i) workers if and only if [value] is non-negative. I am interested in computing the probability that individual (i) is employed at t+1, given that she is unemployed with duration [tau] at t.
317~D1~V1~Variable~Drift~…the drift [mu] is assumed to be nonnegative. The drift is assumed to be common across individuals and constant over time.
317~D1~V2~Variable~Standard Deviation~…the standard deviation [sigma] is assumed to be positive. The standard deviation is assumed to be common across individuals and constant over time.
317~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Standard Brownian Motion~…z(i)(t) is a standard Brownian motion, with increments that are independent over time and across workers.
317~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Unemployment Duration~…[tau] represents the unemployment duration of an individual at time t.
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…the probability that individual (i) is employed at t+1, given that she is unemployed with duration [tau] at t.
317~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate of Finding a Job~…as a preliminary step, and following the logic in Section 5.4 of Alvarez and Shimer (2007), the author derives the hazard rate of finding a job for a worker with unemployment duration [tau].
317~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Value of Working~…if a worker is currently employed, the instantaneous value of working is less than 0.
317~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Probability of Remaining Unemployed~…G([tau], [delta]) denotes the probability the worker is still unemployed after [tau] periods.
317~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate of Finding a Job~…let G([tau], [delta]) denote the probability the worker is still unemployed after [tau] periods. Then, the hazard rate of finding a job after [tau] periods is g([tau], [delta])/G([tau], [delta]). Since a newly unemployed worker has [delta] = 0, take the limit as [delta] -> 0 using L'Hôpital's rule to get the hazard rate of finding a job for a worker whose current unemployment spell has lasted [tau] periods.
317~D1~V1~Variable~Drift~…one can analyze the model with [mu]<0, in which case a worker stays unemployed forever with positive probability.
317~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Cumulative Distribution of the Standard Normal~…[Phi] represents the cumulative distribution of the standard Normal.
317~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Density~…[phi] represents the density of the time when she first finds a job, t + s.
317~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate of Finding a Job~…when [mu] = 0, the hazard is simply 1/(2[tau]).
317~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate of Finding a Job~…an increase in the drift [mu] or decrease in the standard deviation [sigma] raises the hazard at all [tau].
317~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Density~…the density of the time when she first finds a job, t + s, is a standard function of the hazard rate.
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…note that, conditional on becoming employed at t + s, the worker may no longer be employed at t + 1; the probability she is employed is equal to the probability that [delta](t+1) >= 0 conditional on [delta](t+s) = 0. Since [delta](t+1) - [delta](t+s) is normally distributed with mean [mu](1-s) and standard deviation [sigma](root(1-s)), the probability of this event is [Phi]([mu](root(1-s))/sigma). Combining these two pieces and integrating over s gives the probability that a worker who has unemployment duration [tau] at t is reemployed at t +1. This depends only on unemployent duration [tau] and on the ratio [mu]/[sigma], a single parameter. If [mu] = 0, F([tau] = (1 - (root([tau]/(1+[tau]))/2. If a time period is a month, this falls from 50% for a worker who has just entered unemployed to about 2% for a worker who has been unemployed for a year ([tau] = 12). As with the hazard rate, one can prove that higher values of [mu]/[sigma] raise the reemployment probability at all durations. In any case, F([tau]) equals [Phi]([mu]/[sigma]) at [tau] = 0 and falls monotonically to [Phi]([mu]/[sigma]) - [phi]([mu]/[sigma]) X ((root(pi/2)) + [mu]/[sigma]) >=0 as [tau] gets large. For intermediate durations, closed-form solutions are not available, but the integrals are straightforward to compute numerically.
317~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Drift to Standard Deviation Ratio~…the ratio of the drift [mu] to the standard deviation [sigma], a single parameter. As with the hazard rate, one can prove that higher values of [mu]/[sigma] raise the reemployment probability at all durations.
317~D1~V1~Variable~Drift~…if [mu] = 0, F([tau] = (1 - (root([tau]/(1+[tau]))/2.
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…the theory provides a measure of the probability that a worker with unemployment duration [tau] at time t finds a job by time t+1.
317~D1~T1~Time Period~1976-2007~…the empirical section of the current research constructs an empirical counterpart to the theory that measures for the United States from January 1976 to October 2007.
317~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the empirical section of the current research, the author uses the public-use microdata from the Current Population Surveys (CPS), the main US household labor force surveys. 
317~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Unemployment Duration~…each month of the CPS, every unemployed individual reports her unemployment duration in weeks. The author multiplies this by 12/52 to convert to months.
317~D1~V3~Variable~Employment Status~…each month of the CPS, every unemployed individual reports her unemployment duration in weeks. The author multiplies this by 12/52 to convert to months. The author then observes the individual's employment status the following month.
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…the author measures F(t) as the fraction of individuals who report duration [tau] one month and are employed the next month.
317~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample is restricted to individuals who are either job losers or job leavers, about 60% of unemployment, dropping new entrants and reentrants to the labor force.
317~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Value of Working~…the model does not explain why individuals choose to enter or exit the labor force and hence does not predict an initial value for [delta](i) for new entrans and reentrants.
317~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…to observe an individual's employment status the following month, the author takes advantage of the fact that the CPS is a rotating panel. Each address is in the survey for four consecutive months, out for eight months, and then in again for four months. Hence, there is a chance to observe the subsequent month emploment status for about three-quarters of the CPS sample. Unfortunately the attrition of households that move or otherwise leave the survey is not representative of the population.
317~D1~V3~Variable~Employment Status~…to observe an individual's employment status the following month, the author takes advantage of the fact that the CPS is a rotating panel. Each address is in the survey for four consecutive months, out for eight months, and then in again for four months. Hence, there is a chance to observe the subsequent month emploment status for about three-quarters of the CPS sample. Unfortunately the attrition of households that move or otherwise leave the survey is not representative of the population.
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…the job finding probability for reentrants as a function of duration is similar to the probability for job losers and job leavers, while the probability for new entrants is lower and falls less with duration.
317~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the procedures and pitfalls for matching observations in the CPS are well-known. The author matches individual records using rotation group, household identifiers, individual line numbers, race, sex, and age. There are a few gaps in the series due to changes in the household identifiers in the public-use files: it is impossible to match data for December 1977/January 1978, June 1985/July 1985, September 1985/October 1985, December 1993/January 1994, and May 1995/June 1995 to August 1995/September 1995.

317~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…since the redesign of the CPS instrument in 1994, unemployment duration data are often imputed for all workers except those in the first and fifth rotation groups, i.e., those who were not surveyed in the previous month. The author uses data only from these ""incoming rotation groups"" after 1994, which reduces the sample size by a factor of three. Ultimately, 506,000 records were able to be matched during the 32-year period."
317~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Unemployment Duration~…since the redesign of the CPS instrument in 1994, unemployment duration data are often imputed for all workers except those in the first and fifth rotation groups, i.e., those who were not surveyed in the previous month. 
317~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the author weighs observations using the CPS final weights and seasonally adjusts the number of people with duration [tau] with each subsequent employment status using a difference-from-moving average.
317~D1~V3~Variable~Employment Status~…the author seasonally adjusts the number of people with duration [tau] with each subsequent employment status.

317~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Number of People Inactive~…denotes the weighted number of people with unemployed duration [tau] in month t who are inactive (not in the labor force).
317~D1~L3~Variable Value~Inactive~…not in the labor force.
317~D1~F1~Findings~Data Estimates of the Job Finding Probability and Unemployment Duration~…Figure 1 shows that 51% of workers reporting one week duration find a job before the next survey and the share declines sharply thereafter. For workers with duration less than six months, the job finding probability averages 31%. It falls to 19% during the next six months and just 14% for workers who have been unemployed for over a year.
317~D1~F2~Findings~Model Estimates of the Job Finding Probability and Unemployment Duration~…the line in Figure 1 shows the behavior of the model with [mu] = 0.6[sigma]. The probability that a worker who has just become unemployed ([tau] = 0) is employed at the next survey data is [Phi]([mu]/[sigma]) = 0.73. It falls rapidly, reaching 50% after just one week of unemployment and then falling below 20% after 5.5 months. Although not an exact fit - the model overestimates the job finding probability during most of the first 3 months of unemployment and then subsequently underestimates the job finding probability - it is worth stressing that one paramter, [mu]/[sigma], determines the level, slope, and curvature in the model. 
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…to see how the duration-conditional job finding probability changes with the business cycle, the author divides the available data into three bins based on the average job finding probability during the month. In the full sample, an average worker finds a job with probability 0.286. The sample is split based on whether the average job finding probability in month t lies within 2 percentage points of the mean, is above 0.306, or is below 0.266. This classification assigns 32% of months to a high job finding probability, t exists within H, and 24% to a low job finding probability, t exists within L. The author then computes the job finding probability at each duration for these subsets of months, F([tau])^H and F([tau])^L. Figure 2.
317~D1~F3~Findings~The Job Finding Probability, the Business Cycle, and Model Parameters~…Figure 2 shows that F([tau])^H lies on average about 8% above F([tau])^L, with no systematic variation as a function of unemployment duration. In other words, F([tau])^H is simply an upward-shifted version of F([tau]), while F([tau])^L is a downward shift. The curve in the same figure shows the difference between the model-generated value of F([tau] with [mu] = 0.7[sigma] and the one with [mu] = 0.5(sigma). Again, this is nearly independent of unemployment duration. This simple comparative static ignores some potentially interesting dynamics. Suppose the drift suddenly falss from 0.7[sigma] to 0.5[sigma]. The distribution of the value of working changes only gradually, and hence the reemployment hazard takes some timne to fully adjust to the shock. Still, t months after the change in the drift, the reemployment hazard for all workers with current duration [tau] <= t has reached its new steady-state value.
317~D1~F4~Findings~Overall Findings~…to summarize the findings of this research, the model and data both imply that the magnitude of the decline in the job finding probability is similar for all workers, regardless of unemployment duration. Of course, this means that the percentage decline is largest for the long-term unemployed, so a reduction in the job finding probability disproportionately impacts the expected unemployment duration of those workers who are already long-term unemployed.
317~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate of Finding a Job~…if workers are heterogeneous but each has a constant hazard of finding a job, dynamic sorting will lead to a declining aggregate hazard of finding a job as the good workers disappear from the stock of unemployed. Moreover, it is known that observable characteristics help to predict which workers find jobs, so dynamic sorting must be empirically relevant. This suggests that ignoring heterogeneity may bias the analysis. On the contrary, this paper does not ignore heterogeneity.
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~…if workers are heterogeneous but each has a constant hazard of finding a job, dynamic sorting will lead to a declining aggregate hazard of finding a job as the good workers disappear from the stock of unemployed.

This suggests that ignoring heterogeneity may bias the analysis. On the contrary, this paper does not ignore heterogeneity.
317~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Instantaneous Value of Working~…without heterogeneity, z(i)(t) and hence [delta](i)(t) would be the same for all workers, and so all unemployment spells would start and end at the same time. Heterogeneity drives the idiosyncratic Brownian motion, which in turn moves [delta](i)(t).
317~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Standard Brownian Motion~Heterogeneity drives the idiosyncratic Brownian motion, which in turn moves the instantaneous value of working, [delta](i)(t).
317~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Job Finding Probability~"…suppose [sigma]z(i)(t) = [sigma](y)y(i)(t) + [sigma](n)n(i)(t), where y(i)(t) and n(i)(t) are independent Brownian motions. Although y(i)(t+[tau]) - y(i)(t) is Normally distributed with increments that are independent over time and across individuals for any t and [tau], suppose an econometrician can perfectly forecast y(i)(t) using worker characteristics. For example, consider a worker for whom it happens to be the case that y(i)(t+[tau]) = y(i)(t) + v[tau] for all [tau], so d[delta](i)(t) = ([mu] + [sigma](y)v)d(t) + [sigma](n)dn(i)(t). Then, if the worker becomes unemployed at t, her reemployment probability conditional on this path of y(i)(t+[tau]) is given by (2) but depends on the ratio of the conditional drift to the conditional standard deviation, ([mu] + [sigma](y)v)/[sigma](n), rather than the unconditional ratio [mu]/[sigma]. More generally, conditioning on y(i)(t) will complicate the expression for the residual job finding probability and may even eliminate ""true"" duration dependence."
317~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hazard Rate of Finding a Job~…it seems unlikely that the sharp drop in the hazard rate during the first few months of an unemployment spell could reflect loss of skill alone, without the accompanying dynamic selection that the author highlights in the present model.
317~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Standard Brownian Motion~…the drift and standard deviation of the Brownian motion are determined by idiosyncratic shocks to the productivity of intermediate goods producers, as well as the elasticity of substitution between different intermediate goods. The Brownian motion is regulated above by the possibility of new workers entering the market, and it is regulated below by the possibility of exiting for another market. Although this complicate the analysis, the qualitative and quantitative insights of this simple framework for the behavior of reemployment hazards carries over to that model.
317~D1~V2~Variable~Drift~…the drift of the Brownian motion are determined by idiosyncratic shocks to the productivity of intermediate goods producers, as well as the elasticity of substitution between different intermediate goods.
317~D1~V1~Variable~Standard Deviation~…the standard deviation of the Brownian motion are determined by idiosyncratic shocks to the productivity of intermediate goods producers, as well as the elasticity of substitution between different intermediate goods.

320~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Supply of Benefits~…to identify exogenous variation in the supply of disability benefits, researchers exploit the progressivity DI benefits formula. This formula does not account for variation in regional wage levels and hence potential replacement rates are substantially higher in low wage states. This variation yields differential cross-state benefits supply shifts during program contractions and expansions (both of which occurred in the current sample frame) in high versus low replacement rate states.
320~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Supply of Benefits~"…distinct from this literature, the current paper analyzes the impact of the supply of disability benefits on the responses of low-skilled workers to adverse labor market shocks. The rationale for this focus is that nonemployment is a de facto precondition for disability application, making the opportunity cost of seeking DI benefits higher for employed workers than for job losers and nonparticipations. Many potential beneficiaries will therefore seek benefits in the event of job loss but not otherwise. Researchers call these potential beneficiaries ""conditional applicatnts""."
320~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Supply of Benefits~…in the current empirical model, in a market setting where all job separations were involuntary, workers would apply for DI benefits only at the onset of illness or job loss. An analysis of the impact of shifts in the supply of benefits on labor force participation would therefore focus on the labor supply decisions of displaced workers, specifically whether they chose to seek new employment or apply for DI benefits instead. Since in reality workers can endogenously quit jobs to obtain DI benefits, shifts in benefits supply might instead largely impact labor supply by inducing endogenous quits even absent adverse shocks. 
320~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Supply of Benefits~"…researchers denote the DI benefits ""supply"" faced by the potential labor force participant as g(d, p), assumed to be increasing in both the replacement rate d and the odds of obtaining benefits conditional on application p."
320~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Supply of Benefits~…as a proxy for changes in the supply of disability benefits, researchers initially use the observed contemporaneous state-level changes in DI recipients per 1000 nonelderly population ages 25 to 64 ([delta](DI)(jT)). Researchers subsequently instrument the measure for changes in the supply of benefits  through a total count of nonelderly recipients by state.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~DV10~Derived Variable~Asset Value of Employment~"…the asset value of employment is a function of the three decision rules (""policies"") that a worker may pursue.

The second term is the value of remaining employed until exogenous job loss and then seeing disability benefits thereafter. The third policy in brackets is the value of remaining in the labor market in perpetutity. The three components are linked by the max operator because the value of employment for a given individual corresponds to the policy (I, C, R) that yields the highest expected utility."

320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV17~Derived Variable~Hazard of Reemployment~…unemployed job seekers face a per-period hazard q of reemployment.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV17~Derived Variable~Hazard of Reemployment~…the reemployment hazard is used in computing the asset value of no application.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV18~Derived Variable~Probability of Qualification~…applicants with health h qualify for benefits after one period with probability p = p(h), and rejected applicants may reapply. Consistent with DI program rules, labor force participants are rejected with probability one.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV18~Derived Variable~Probability of Qualification~…to simplify the analysis, researchers consider a set of individuals who face a common probability of DI award conditional on application: p(h(i)) = p for all (i).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~DV19~Derived Variable~Asset Value of Immediate Application~…the value of quitting employment directly to seek disability benefits. The asset value of policy I is the present discounted value of permanent benefits receipt V(D) = u(d)/(1 - [beta]) discounted by the expected time from quit to award, where u(d) is the per period utility of receiving DI benefits.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV2~Derived Variable~Demand for Benefits~…to identify exogenous variation in the demand for benefits, researchers follow Bartik [1991] in constructing a measure of state level labor demand shifts at low and medium frequency. This measure, a weighted sum of national industry employment changes (excluding own state employment) projected onto state industry composition, performs well in predicting the flow of DI applications by state, indicating that adverse demand shocks raise demand for disability benefits.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~DV20~Derived Variable~Asset Value of Conditional Application~"…the value of remaining employed until exogenous job loss and then seeking disability benefits thereafter. Researchers refer to this policy as ""conditional application"" and its value incorporates the asset value of applying for and ultimately receing DI benefits and the expected flow value of employment prior to DI application."
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV21~Derived Variable~Discounted Value of Permanent Benefits Receipt~…the present discount value of permanent benefits receipt as accounted for in computing the asset value of policy V(I).
320~D1, D2, D4~DV22~Derived Variable~Expected Flow Value of Employment~…the expected flow value of employment prior to DI application as used in computing the asset value of conditional application.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~DV23~Derived Variable~Asset Value of No Application~…the asset value of remaining in the labor market in perpetuity. Because workers pursuing this policy seek reemployment (not DI benefits) after job loss, the reemployment hazard q appears in this expression while the benefits award hazard p does not .
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Locus of Immediate/Conditional~…the locus of immediate application is independent of the hazard of job loss as an individual who is indifferent between immediate and conditional disability application is by definition indifferent to a change in the job loss hazard that hastens or retards the moment of application. Because workers pursuing (I) and (C) do not reenter the labor market after exit, the locus of immediate application is also independent of the reemployment hazard.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV24~Derived Variable~Locus of Immediate/Conditional~…increases in d and p shift both the locus of conditional/remain and immediate/condtional rightward, raising the total share of workers who eventually seek benefits, both immediately and after job loss. Increases in d and p - and the interaction of th two- shift the conditional/remain-in-labor-force locus farther rightward than the immediate/conditional locus.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV25~Derived Variable~Locus of Conditional/Remain~…the locus of conditional application is independent of the hazard of job loss as an individual who is indifferent between immediate and conditional disability application is by definition indifferent to a change in the job loss hazard that hastens or retards the moment of application. Because workers pursuing (I) and (C) do not reenter the labor market after exit, the locus of conditional application is also independent of the reemployment hazard.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV25~Derived Variable~Locus of Conditional/Remain~…increases in d and p shift both the locus of conditional/remain and immediate/condtional rightward, raising the total share of workers who eventually seek benefits, both immediately and after job loss. Increases in d and p - and the interaction of th two- shift the conditional/remain-in-labor-force locus farther rightward than the immediate/conditional locus.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV26~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…a vector of individual charactersitics as a factor in computing the conditional expectation of labor force participation.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV27~Derived Variable~Impact of Potential Benefits on Labor Force Participation~…the coefficient of interest in probit regressions is the impact of potential benefits on labor force participation.
320~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rate~…the percentage point change in the labor force participation rate is calculated from the merged monthly files of the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1978 to 1998.
320~D1~DV28~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rate~…labor force participation rates  are the fractions of nonelderly adults in the relevant gender/education category who are in  the labor force (employed or unemployed).
320~D1, D2~DV29~Derived Variable~Changes in DI Recipients per 1000 Nonelderly Adults~…the change in DI Rolls per population is annualized changes in DI recipients per 1000 state population ages 25 to 64. In OLS specfiications, this variable is treated as exogenous.
320~D1, D2~DV29~Derived Variable~Changes in DI Recipients per 1000 Nonelderly Adults~…as a proxy for changes in the supply of disability benefits, researchers initially use the observed contemporaneous state-level changes in DI recipients per 1000 nonelderly population ages 25 to 64 ([delta](DI)(jT)).
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV3~Derived Variable~Disability Insurance, Adverse Demand Shocks~…researchers examine the interaction of disability program with adverse demand shocks.
320~D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Potential Replacement Rate~…researchers subsequently instrument the measure for changes in the supply of benefits  through a total count of nonelderly recipients by state.
320~D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Potential Replacement Rate~…in IV specfiications, the change in DI recipients per 1000 nonelderly adults is instrumented by the potential replacement rate for currently employed nonelderly adult males ages 25 to 61 at the seventy-fifth percentile of the state's earning replacement rate distribution in 1978.
320~D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Potential Replacement Rate~…the potential replacement rate is calculated from the 1978 Current Population Survey/Social Security Earnings Records Exact Match file.
320~D4~DV30~Derived Variable~Potential Replacement Rate~…to calculate 1978 state-level potential DI replacement rates, researchers use the CPS Social Security Earnings Records Exact Match file, which contains Social Security earnings records in each year 1951 to 1977 for currently employed males in the CPS sample. Researchers calculate the potential DI replacemetn rate for all employed males ages 25 to 61 in each state in 1978 and use the seventy-fifth percentile in each state as a measure of the potential replacement rate faced by low wage workers.
320~D4~DV31~Derived Variable~Screening Stringency Shift, State Replacement Rates~…the interaction between national shifts in the DI screening regime and state replacement rates may serve as an instrument for the state-level shifts in the supply of DI benefits provided that these interactions are not peversely correlated with state-level health and income shocks in both retrenchment and reform periods. This possibility seems particularly unlikely because the supply shifts are of opposite sign for each state in the retrenchment and reform eras.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…to test the implication that reduced screening stringency, rising replacement rates, and declining demand for low-skilled workers should have raised the relative attractiveness of DI application and labor froce exit for workers facing adverse shocks, researchers require a measure of plausibly exogenous labor demand shocks. Following the approach of related literature, researchers exploit cross-state differences in industrial composition and national-level cahnges in employment to predict individual state employment growth.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…the predicted log employment change, n(jT) is calculated for each state between years t and T where n(kt) is the log change in two-digit industry k's employment share nationally and y(jkt) is the share of state employment in industry k in state j in the initial year.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…this methodology predicts what each state's change in employment would be if industry level employment changes occurred uniformly across states and state-level industrial composition was fixed in the short term. States that had a relatively large share of workers in declining industries will have predicted employment declines, while states that differentially employed workers in growing industries will have predicted increases.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…the independent variable in equation (10) is the annualized projected state log employment shock measure for the corresponding time interval.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…equation (10) estimates that pool data for the entire time period add an interaction between the shock measure and a post-1984 dummy variable.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…since the demand shock captures net rather than gross employment declines over comparatively long three-year intervals, displaced high school dropouts who obtain reemployment within the measurement window are not detected. In addition, the shock measure does not impact the labor market exclusively through job loss. Adverse shocks will induce some subset of workers to choose to exit employment and, perhaps more importantly, slow the prevailing rate of reentry of nonparticipants into the labor force. Similarly, some share of those exiting may be previously unemployed workers whose reemployment prospects were harmed by entry of new unemployed.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Exogenous Labor Demand Shocks~…to gauge the importance of changes in the DI program for the aggregate labor market, researchers calculate the demand contraction experienced by high school dropouts over the post-disability-reform years to form a counterfactual labor force participation figure net of disability. This approach does not allow researchers to disaggregate the separate labor market impacts of reduced screening and rising replacement rates.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV33~Derived Variable~Log Change in Two-Digit Industry~…the log change in two-digit industry k's employment share nationally.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV34~Derived Variable~Share of State Employment~…the share of state employment in industry k in state j in the initial year.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV35~Derived Variable~Flow of State DI Applications~…ignoring demographic characteristics in (9) for the moment, researchers write the model for the flow of state DI application in year t through T where the direct impact of employment losses on DI application flows in year t is taken into account. Equation (10).
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV35~Derived Variable~Flow of State DI Applications~…the dependent variable in equation (10) is the annualized state level flow of unique DI applications per capita during 1978 to 1984 and 1984 to 1998.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~DV36~Derived Variable~Direct Impact of Employment Loss~…measures the direct impact of employment losses on DI application flows in year t.
320~D1, D3~DV37~Derived Variable~Labor Force Exit~…researchers model labor force exit. In this equation declines in labor force participation come from two sources: workers who withdraw from the labor force but do not seek DI benefits; and job losers who leave the labor force to seek DI benefits. As the equation underscores, the data do not permit a direct estimate of the parameter of interest in (9). Instead, estimates of (11) will yield a reduced form that combines both sources of labor force exit. Equation (11) and (12).
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV38~Derived Variable~Change in Flow of State DI Applications~…the change in the responsiveness of DI applications to demand shocks of given magnitude.
320~D1, D3~DV39~Derived Variable~Change in Labor Force Exit~…the change in labor force exit to demand shocks of given magnitude.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…as an alternative explanation for the observed labor force exit of less-skilled workers, researchers explore the importance of falling wages.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…real wages are calculated from CPS March Annual Demographic files as annual earnings of full-time male high school dropouts ages 25 to 64 for earnings years 1979 and 1998. Wage series are deflated by the chain-weighted PCE deflator.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…to simplify the analysis, researchers restrict attention to the case in which w is time varying.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…it is assumed that w is fixed; workers keep their current wage until job loss. While this assumption is clearly too strong, it is qualitatively consistent with well-known evidence that wages of incumbent workers are substantially more sheltered from labor market conditions than those of job seekers. Broadening the model to permit expectations of w to depend on labor market conditions and the worker's employment/unemployment state would likely increase the differential attractiveness of disability applications for job losers relative to employed.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…the opportunity wage as a factor in computing the conditional expectation of labor force participation.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…a sizable elasticity of labor force participation coupled with declining real wages could explain the substantial decline in labor force participation of low skilled males in the 1980s and 1990s. To be clear, researchers view falling wages as a complement rather than a substitute for the role of the DI program in reducing labor force participation. Indeed, an important compoent of the rise in replacement rates for low-skilled workers is the interaction between declining wages and the indexation and progressivity of the DI benefits formula. For declining real wages to be the primary explanation for the current findings, however, it would have to be the case that, not implausibly, wages fell by substantially more in states that had larger declines in labor force participation.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…because the declining wage hypothesis implies that workers with the lowest potential earnings are least likely to work, researchers follow Chandra [2002] in including nonparticipants in the quantile calculations, thus assuming that the potential earnings of nonparticipants fall below the median (or twenty-fifth) percentile of the conditional state wage distributions. 
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…for workers employed in the survey reference week, wages were calculated by dividing usual weekly earnings by usual weekly hours.
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…wage observations were dropped for which caluclated wages fell outside the range of $1 and $150 per hour (in year 2000 dollars). In cases where state-year-age-education cells were empty, researchers assinged the median value of corresponding nonempty cells. Researchers use fixed age weights corresponding to the share of males (male high school dropouts) in state population in 1984 ages 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64. Wages are inflated to 2000 values using the chain weighted Personal Consumption Expenditure deflator. 
320~D1, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Real Wages~…researchers do not impute wages for individuals who are out of th labor force.
320~D1, D3~DV40~Derived Variable~Employment to Population Ratio~…this variable is equal to the observed change in the employment to population rate of high school dorpouts instrumented by the predicted employment change measure (and its interaction with a post-1984 dummy).
320~D1, D3~DV40~Derived Variable~Employment to Population Ratio~…since the demand shock captures net rather than gross employment declines over comparatively long three-year intervals, displaced high school dropouts who obtain reemployment within the measurement window are not detected. In addition, the shock measure does not impact the labor market exclusively through job loss. Adverse shocks will induce some subset of workers to choose to exit employment and, perhaps more importantly, slow the prevailing rate of reentry of nonparticipants into the labor force. Similarly, some share of those exiting may be previously unemployed workers whose reemployment prospects were harmed by entry of new unemployed. Each of these forces will reduce the employment to population ratio and yield corresponding increases in nonparticipation.
320~D1, D3~DV41~Derived Variable~Employment Rates~…annual, state-level data on employment, unemployment, and labor force nonparticipation by gender, age, and education category for individual between the ages of 25 and 64 were calculated using the complete Current Population Survey monthly files for years 1978-1999. The number of observations ranges from 1.1 to 1.3 million annually. All calculations use CPS sampling weights.
320~D1, D3~DV42~Derived Variable~Unemployment Rates~…annual, state-level data on employment, unemployment, and labor force nonparticipation by gender, age, and education category for individual between the ages of 25 and 64 were calculated using the complete Current Population Survey monthly files for years 1978-1999. The number of observations ranges from 1.1 to 1.3 million annually. All calculations use CPS sampling weights.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV43~Derived Variable~Conditional Relationship Between Demand Shocks and Applications~…plots the conditional relationship between estimated log demand shocks (multiplied by 10^3) and DI applications per 1000 population for four five-year subperiods of the sample.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV44~Derived Variable~High School Dropout Labor Force Exit Propensity~…the generosity of the DI program is calculated contingent on a measure of the impact of employment shocks on DI applications for the entire population. To make the magnitudes commensurate, researchers calculate an equation proxying for generosity factoring in the high school dropout share of population in the years of estimation, equal to 16 percentage points in the sample, and the share of the total flow of DI applications submitted by high school dropouts, which researchers estimate to be 47%.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV44~Derived Variable~High School Dropout Labor Force Exit Propensity~…in this estimate the inverse of the share of high school dropout share of population in the years of estimation rescales the estimated increase in DI application per population to an increase per high school dorpout population.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV45~Derived Variable~High School Dropout Share of Population~…the high school dropout share of populatio in the years of estimation, equal to 16 percentage points in the current sample.
320~D1, D4~DV46~Derived Variable~High School Dropout Change in the Real Fixed-Weighted Median Log Wage~…the change in the real fixed-weighted median log wage of high school dropout males ages 25 to 64.
320~D1, D4~DV46~Derived Variable~High School Dropout Change in the Real Fixed-Weighted Median Log Wage~…in an effort to maximize the explanatory power of alternative hypotheses, researchers chose the more inclusive measure of wages for male high school dropouts (i.e. ages 25 to 64 rather than 25 to 54). Empirically, the wage measure for the younger group of high school dropouts works similarly but has less predictive power in labor force participation regressions.
320~D1, D4~DV46~Derived Variable~High School Dropout Change in the Real Fixed-Weighted Median Log Wage~…one of two calculated measure of the change in the opportunity wage faced by low-skilled workers in each state between 1984 and 1998.
320~D1, D4~DV47~Derived Variable~Change Male High School Dropout Median Wage~..the change in the male high school dropout median wage is the change in the fixed weighted median wage of all male high school dropout state residents ages 25 to 64 excluding the self-employed, those working without pay, and employed workers for whom a wage could not be calculated. Weights correspond to 1984 state male population shares for ages 25 to 64 in ten year brackets.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV48~Derived Variable~Share of Dropout DI Applications~…the share of the total flow of DI applications submitted by high school dropouts, which researchers estimate to be 47%. 
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV48~Derived Variable~Share of Dropout DI Applications~…in computing the generosity of the DI program, this parameter adjusts this estimate downward to account for the fact that only part of the growth in DI applications is due to high school dropouts.
320~D1~DV49~Derived Variable~Change in Share Foreign Born~…the change in the share foreign born is the 1984 to 1998 change in share of population 25 to 64 that is foreign born calculated from the 1998 Current Population Survey and linearly interpolated for the year 1984 using the 1980 and 1990 Census PUMS 1 percentile samples.
320~D1, D3~DV50~Derived Variable~Rescale Weight~…the inverse of the high school dropout share of population.
320~D1, D3~DV50~Derived Variable~Rescale Weight~…in computing the generosity of the DI program, this weight rescales the estimated increase in DI applications per population to an increase per high school dropout population.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV51~Derived Variable~Steady State Population~…P* is the steady state population.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV51~Derived Variable~Steady State Population~…drawing on data from SSA's Annual Statistical Supplement [various year], Figure IV depicts estimates of P* normalized by population for the years 1976 to 2001.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV51~Derived Variable~Steady State Population~…by using average termination rates, the calculation does not adjust for the fact that more recent DI entrants are likely to have lower mortality and retirement rates than incumbent recipients. Accounting for these cohort effects would likely raise the steady state projection considerably. The projected steady state series is imputed in 1997 using the average 1996 and 1998 to discount the one-time termination of beneficiaries whose impairment was Drug and Alcohol Addiction.
320~D1, D2, D3~DV51~Derived Variable~Steady State Population~…as the figure indicates, steady state program size in 1976 exceeded its 2001 state level. It was SSA's recognition of this fact that galvanized the DI program retrenchment and subseuqne liberalization that form the backdrop to the current study.
320~D4~DV52~Derived Variable~Prime Age Change in the Real Fixed-Weighted Log Wage~…the change in the real fixed-weighted log wage of prime age males 25 to 54 at the twenty-fifth percentile.
320~D4~DV52~Derived Variable~Prime Age Change in the Real Fixed-Weighted Log Wage~…one of two calculated measure of the change in the opportunity wage faced by low-skilled workers in each state between 1984 and 1998.
320~D6~DV53~Derived Variable~UI Replacement Rate~…researchers measure UI generosity as the 1984 to 1999 change in the state UI replacement rates for a full-time minimum wage worker using data from the U.S. House of Representatives Green Book. Althought the mean UI replacement rate did not change appreciably between 1984 and 1998, some states made substantial adjustments.
320~D6~DV53~Derived Variable~UI Replacement Rate~…UI generosity corresponds to the 1984 and 1999 potential state UI replacement rate for a full-time minimum wage worker. 
320~D4~DV54~Derived Variable~Change in Twenty-Fifth Percentile Wage~…the change in the twenty-fifth percentile wage is the analogous fix weighted wage for male prime-age residents ages 25 to 54.
320~D9~DV55~Derived Variable~Change in Mortality Rates~…mortality rate is the number of nonaccidental, nonhomicidal deaths among ages 25 to 64 divided by the average of state population 25 to 64 in the previous and current year. The change in mortality rate is the change int his number.
320~D5~DV56~Derived Variable~Change in Incarceration Rate~…the change in the incarceration rate is the change in state prison population (excluding jails) per capita 18 to 64 from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
320~D6~DV57~Derived Variable~Change in UI Replacement Rate~…the change in UI replacement rate is the 1984 to 1998 change in state UI replacement rate for a full-time minimum wage worker from the Green Book: Overview of Entitlement Prgorams and is not available for Michigan.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV58~Derived Variable~Screening Stringency~"…over the past two decades, two important changes have impacted eligibility and generosity for the DI program. The first, occuring in 1984, liberalized the disability determination processs, reversing a dramatic reduction in disability rolls underways. The second occurred more gradually. Because the DI benefits formula is progressive and indexed to the mean wage in the economy, the widening dispersion of earnings during the 1980s and 1990s substantially raised the ratio of disability income to prior earnings (the ""replacement rate"") for low-skilled workers, a trend augmented by the rising real value of medical benefits provided."
320~D2~DV59~Derived Variable~Percent Receiving SSI Benefits~"…an individual is classified as an SSI recipient if she ""did receive any income from Supplemental Security Income for him/herself during the reference period."""
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…replacement rates are a partial function of declining relative wages for low-skilled workers.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…potentially as significant as the expanding supply of DI benefits during the survey period was an unforeseen rise in the earnings replacement rate. This rise was caused by the interaction between the DI benefits indexation schedule and the growth of earnings inequality in the United States economy.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…the increase in the proportional difference between mean wages and below-mean wages caused the DI replacement rate for low-wage workers to rise substantially.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…the cash income replacement rate.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…replacement rates are calculated using the Social Security Adminstration Disability Insurance benefit formula for 1979 and 1999 in cojuction with annual earnings data from the March CPS files for the years 1963 to 1993 and the 1978 CPS Social Security Earnings Records Exact Match file for the years 1961 to 1962.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…the baseline calculations of this measure represent the ratio of potential disability benefits to current earnings for males in the labor force and with nonzero earnings in 1978 and 1998. The latter calculations add average Medicare expenditures to DI benefits and average percentile-specific fringe benefits to earnings to estimate a total compensation measure fo the replacement rate.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…the instrumental variable employed is the earnings replacement rate at the seventy-fifth percentile of the male potential DI replacement rate distribution calculated from the CPS-SSER. Researchers use the earnings of males exclusively because of their high rate of labor force attachment, and use the seventy-fifth percentile replacement rate - typically corresponding to low earnings workers - because of the current focus on labor supply of low skilled.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…for the replacement rate calculations, researchers utilize annual earnings data from the 1964-1999 March CPS Annual Demographic Files and the 1978 CPS Social Security Earnings Records Exact Match file (CPS-SSER).
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…the Cash Income Replacement Rate equals the ratio of DI benefits in year T + 1 to after-payroll-tax earnings in year T. Calculations for 1999 use the 1965-1999 March CPS files, while the 1979 calculations utilize both the 1964 to 1979 March CPS files and the 1978 CPS-SSER file (for earnings from 1951 -1962).
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…to the extent that male labor force nonparticipation has increased differentially at the low end of the earnings distribution, the algorithm is likely to understate the actual increase in replacement rates for low-skilled workers.
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…researchers use the simulated replacement rates in 1979 for comparability with the simulated values for 1999 (for which no CPS-SSER data are available).
320~D6~DV6~Derived Variable~Replacement Rates~…replacement rates that include the value of Medicare benefits in the final two columns add average Medicare expenditures for DI beneficiaries in the relevant year to the DI benefit amount and scale arnings to account for average fringe benefit rates for individuals at each of the five earnings percentiles in 1982 and 1996.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~DV60~Derived Variable~Potential DI Benefits~…researchers use the median AIME within each of four age brackets to calculate potential DI benefits in year T + 1 by applying the PIA formula in equation (2).
320~D8~DV14~Derived Variable~Benefit-Wage Ratios~…the average benefit wage ratios were caluclated at the tenth, twenty-fifth, fiftieth, seventy-fifth, and ninetieth earnings percentiles in 1982 and 1996.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…earnings exceeding $500 per month in 1989 would have automatically disqualified a DI applicant.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…in determing an individual's DI benefit, the first step is to compute the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) contingent on an individual's average monthly earnings (conditional on employment) in each year t, inflated to current dollars by the ratio of the average wage in the United States economy two year's prior to the average wage in the year of earnings.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…because the wage index applied in (1) and (2) inflates prior earnings to current dollars using the growth rate of average nominal wages, the indexed monthly earnings (AIME) computed in step 1 of the benefits calculation for this low earnings-growth individual would exceed current earnings. Additionally, because the bend points in (2) follow the same wage index, these would also have risen relative to individual earnings. A greater share of the worker's AIME would therefore be replaced on the steeper sections of the curve (i.e. in the 90 and 32 percent ranges rather than the 15 percent range).
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…indexation of earnings to the mean wage raises the ratio of AIME to prior earnings.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…to calculate Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) for an M year old Nth percentile worker in year T, researchers use equation (1) and assume that this individual was an M - t year old Nth percentile worker in year T - t and that low earnings years (those excluded in the AIME calculation) occured before the age of 25. Percentile ranks in this calculation are year and age specific.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…in each year between 1951 and 1998, researchers calculate the tenth, twenty-fifth, fiftieth, seventy-fifth, and ninetieth percentile of earnings for males at each age 25 to 61 inclusive to construct an age-year earnings files with 1776 observations (48 years, 37 ages). Because only earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax are used in calculating Social Security benefits, all earnings percentiles in excess of the taxable maximum in a particular year are truncated at the maximum. Researchers assume that n Nth percentile worker who was M years old in year T was an Nth percentile M - t year old worker in year T - t and estimate Average Indexed Monthly Earnings.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…the calculation of Average Indexed Monthly Earnings is dependent on the taxable earnings for an m year old Nth percentile worker in year t where t is euql to T - (M - m). The indexing series factor is obtained from the Social Security Administration and is equal to mean national earnings in year T-2 divided by mean national earnings in year t (with a minimum value of 1).
320~D1, D2, D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Average Indexed Monthly Earnings~…because the social security adminstration only considered earnings after 1950 in calculating DI benefits in 1979, the maximum number of years of prior earnings in the 1979 AIME caclulation is 28.
320~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Average Monthly Earnings~…Y(it) is equal to an individual's average monthly earnings (conditional on employment) in each year t.
320~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mean Wage Index~…average monthly earnings are inflated to current dollars by the ratio of the average wage in the United States economy two year's prior to the average wage in the year of earnings.
320~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mean Wage Index~…the bend points in the piecewise linear formula, used to compute the primary insurance amount, are rescaled each year by average wage growth in the economy. Indexation of the benefit formula to the mean wage in the economy ensures that benefit levels keep pace with aggregate earnings growth.
320~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mean Wage Index~…the two-year lag for the earnings indexation factor in equation (1) reflects the historic time lag required for calculating the numerator of this series.
320~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mean Wage Index~…the wage index inflates prior earnings to current dollars using the growth rate of average nominal wages.
320~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Mean Wage Index~…the indexing series factor is obtained from the Social Security Administration and is equal to mean national earnings in years T - 2 divided by mean national earnings in year t (with a minimum value of 1).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4~F1~Findings~The Distributional Impacts of Indexation~…currently employed male workers ages 55 to 61 at the tenth percentile of the (age-specific) earnings distribution who obtained DI benefits in 1979 would have replaced 52% of their current earnings with DI cash transfers. By 1999, this number had risen to 74%. Accounting for the rising value of in-kind Medicare benefits, the potential DI replacement rate for a tenth percentile male age 55 to 61 rose still further from 67 to 104 percent. Nor was this rise limited to the older workers. for males at the tenth percentile of earnings, the rise in the replacement rate exceeded 18 percentage points in all age brackets. At higher positions in the earnings distribution, however, the growth was far less pronounced. For workers at the seventy-fifth and ninetieth percentiles of earnings, potential replacement rates rose a comparatively modest 4 to 8 percentage points.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F10~Findings~Supply of Benefits and Labor Force Participation Rates for Males~…for males, inward shifts in the supply of DI benefits raised the labor force participation of low-skilled males and females during 1978 to 1984; outward supply shifts reduced them thereafter. IV estimates again show no impact of DI benefits on the labor force participation of more-skilled workers.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F11~Findings~Supply of Benefits and Labor Force Participation Rates for Females~…for females, researchers find that the supply of DI benefits reduces the labor force participation of high school dropout females and not those with higher education both durig the retrechment and reform periods. These results are especially striking in light of the fact that female labor force participation rose at all educaiton levels over 1984 to 1998.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F12~Findings~Pre-DI Liberalization Period and Log State Employment~…in the equation (10) estimates, for the pre-DI liberalization period of 1978 to 1984, the point estimate of -0.13 indicates that a 1-percent projected log state employment contraction yielded 1.3 additional DI applications per 1000 nonelderly adults over these five years.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F13~Findings~The Impact of Adverse Shocks on DI Application Flows~…in the equation (10) estimates, for the entire time period, the coefficient on the interaction term implies that the impact of adverse shocks on DI application flows grew threefold from the retrenchment to the reform era. Adding state dummies to control for fixed state differences in DI application flows only slightly reduces the magnitude of the estimated growth, which remains highly significant.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F14~Findings~Demand Shock Locus, Replacement Rates, and Screening Stringency~…consistent with the contemporaneous rise in replacement rates and the decline in screening stringency post 1984, the slope of the demand shock-DI application locus increases secularly in each adjacent panel. By 1993-1998 researchers estimate that this slope has increased sevenfold.
320~D1, D3~F15~Findings~Employment to Population Ratio, Unemployment to Population Ratio and Nonemployment to Population Ratio~…during 1978 to 1984, a one-percentage point shock to the employment to population ratio of high school dropouts induced a 0.46 percentage point increase in nonparticipation per population and, by implication, a 0.54 percentage point increase in unemployment per population.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F17~Findings~Labor Force Exit Propensity Post-1984~…pooled regression estimates confirm a significant increase in the labor force exit propensity of displaced high school dropouts after 1984, on the order of 35%.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F18~Findings~Impact of Employment Shocks on DI Applications~…the estimate of the impact of employment shocks on DI applications for the entire nonelderly population ranges from 0.05 to 0.17, i.e., the fraction of all nonelderly adults applying for DI benefits in response to a one log point adverse demand shock rose by 0.5 to 1.7 applicants per 1000 adults post liberalization.
320~D6, D7~F19~Findings~DI Program Generosity~…substituting into (13), researchers obtain that the implied increase in high school dropout labor force exit propensity for a one log point contraction, the generosity of the DI program, ranges from 0.15 to 0.50. That is, if the increase in high school dropout application propensity were entirely accounted for by labor force leavers, the estimated increase in application sensitivity implies a 15 to 50 percentage point increase in their conditional probability of labor force exit. Based upon this (necessarily) rough calculation, researchers conclude that the increasing supply of DI benefits post-1984 can plausibly account for both greater DI application flows for given shocks and greater propensity of adversely shocked low-skilled workers to exit the labor force. 
320~D1, D2~F2~Findings~DI Receipt Rate From 1984 to 1999 Across Genders~…among males ages 25 to 39 and 40 to 54, DI receipt rose by 50% between 1984 and 1999. The proportional increase for males above age 54 was only one-quarter as large. Among women, growth in DI receipt was even more rapid but also skewed toward younger recipients. On net, the share of DI recipients between the ages of 40 and 54 rose by more than 50 percent following the 1984 liberaliziation while the share of male beneficiaries declined by 15%.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F20~Findings~Share of High School Dropout Exit and Post-Liberalization Shock~…estimates indicate that the share of high school dropouts exiting the labor force in response to a one unit shock post-liberalization increased by 34 percentage points.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F21~Findings~Aggregate Employment Hypotheticals and Disability Liberalization~…consider that the typical nonelderly (that is age 25 to 64) high school dropout in 1984 was employed in an industry that over the next fourteen years declined by 8.53 percentage points as a share of aggregate employment Combining this negative relative demand contraction with the estimate of 0.34 for unit liberalization, researchers calculate that the share of nonelderly adult high school dropouts who were unemployed would have been 2.9 percentage points higher in 1998 (8.53 X 0.34 = 2.90) but for the liberalization of DI that occured in 1984. Since nonelderly dropouts accounted for 12.1% of the nonelderly adult population in 1998, this suggests that the aggregate unemployment rate would have been approximately half (0.44) of a percentage point higher in 1998 if it were not for DI liberalization. Because the unemployment rate is denominated by labor force and not by population, the estimated impact using the overall nonelderly adult (ages 25 to 64) participation rate of 80.3% is (2.90 X 0.121)/0.803 = 0.44. Given that the overall unemployment rate of nonelderly adults in this year was 3.4%, this appears a sizable deviation from the conventional metric.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F22~Findings~Steady State Program Size Over the Relevant Period~…following the 1984 liberalization, the steady state program size rapidly doubled from its 1982 low. At the onset of the 1991 recession, award rates increased by another 50% and the projected program size rose accordingly. By 1995 the projected steady state program size had reached 5.1% of nonelderly adults, where it largely remained for the balance of the decade.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F23~Findings~Steady State Population Growth in DI Program Size Relative to Population Over the Relevant Period~…given that 3.7% of nonelderly adults received DI benefits in 2001, the steady state population calculation augurs another 40% growth in DI program size relative to population over approximately the next decade. Notably, application rates per population rose an additional 22% between 1999 and 2001, indicating the potential for another rise in steady state program size. The DI recipient population may never reach this projected size, however. 
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F24~Findings~Median Potential Wages of Male High School Dropouts~…median potential wages of male high school dropouts declined 18.6 log points between 1984 and 1998.
320~D1, D2, D4, D5, D6, D9, D10~F25~Findings~Alternative Explanatory Variable Estimation Results~…higher initial mortality (though not its change) declines in median wages of high school dropouts, and decreases in the share of foreign born, each contributed to growth in state DI rolls and declines in high school dropout labor force participation during the relevant fourteen years. Researchers do not find a significant relationship between incarceration or UI replacement rates and either DI receipt or high school dropout labor force participation. Notably, none of these measures greatly affects the estimated impact of the replacement rate on growth in DI rolls and declines in labor force participation. In all cases, DI benefits supply appears a robust determinant of both growth in DI rolls and declines in high school dropout labor force participation.
320~D1, D6~F26~Findings~Simulated Replacement Rates Across Data Sets and Earnings Percentiles~…the 1979 simulated replacement rates for males at the twenty fifth percentile of the earnings distribution for age groups 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55 to 61 are 41, 41, 41, and 45 percent. The corresponding replacement rates from the 1978 CPS-SSER data are 43, 41, 43, and 45 percent. 
320~D4, D8~F27~Findings~Medicare Expenditures and Average Benefit-Wage Ratios Across Time~...average Medicare expenditures for DI beneficiaries in 1979 were $2890 (in 1998 dollars) and in $4749 in 1998 (the most recent year for which data were available). Average benefit-wage ratios in 1982 were 0.0923, 0.1911, 0.2512, 0.2780, 0.2801 for the tenth, twenty-fifth, fiftieth, seventy-fifth, and ninetieth percentiles, while the corresponding ratios in 1996 were 0.0778, 0.1743, 0.2554, 0.2965, and 0.2988.
320~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~DI Receipt Rate Across Gender, Education and Age~…using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), researchers estimate that the share of high school dropouts receiving disability benefits rose by over 60% after 1984, and more than doubled for high school dropout males ages 40 to 54. In 1999, a 40 to 54 year old high school dropouts was four to five times as likely to receive DI benefits as a male in the same age range with at least a high school degree. Relative to high school dropouts, proportionate growth in DI receipt for those with at least a high school degree was substantially smaller among males and slightly larger among females. In all cases, growth among better educated workers was from a low base.
320~D1, D3~F4~Findings~Labor Force Participation, Education, and Age~…between 1984 and 1999 the labor force participation rate of high school dropout males declined by 8.7 percengage points among those 40 to 54, and 7 percentage points among those 55 to 64. Simultaneously, the share of male high school dropouts in these age brackets receiving DI rose by 5.3 and 6.3 percentage points. Hence, despite the steep decline in male high school dropout participation, the share of male high school dropout nonparticipants receiving DI benefits in these age categories rose to slightly above 40%. Unemployment per population rates of high school dropouts also fell steeply during these years.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~F5~Findings~DI Rolls Post-1984~…following the 1984 liberalization, DI rolls increased at an average annual rate of 4.2 percent (excluding dependents of DI recipients). As younger cohorts with lower mortality impairments entered, the annual mortality rate of DI recipients fell by 35%, and the exit rate into the retirement system declined by 40%. Accordingly, the expected benefit duration of newer cohorts, substantially exceeds 1984 levels. An exception to this expansionary trend was Congress' 1996 discontinuation of benefits for individuals who qualified for disability on the basis of alcohol and drug addicition.
320~D1, D2, D3~F6~Findings~Per-Capita DI Receipt Over the Relevant Time Period~…a comparison of the two periods spanning 1979-1984 and 1984-1998 provides a useful contrast: per-capita DI receipt among nonelderly adults contracted at 0.10 percentage points annually during 1979-1984 and then expanded at 0.07 percentage points per year during the subsequent fourteen years. If the supply of disability benefits impacts labor supply, it should have had opposite impacts on labor force participation during these two time period.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D7~F7~Findings~Disability Rolls and Labor Force Participation Rates~…states with more rapid declines in disability rolls per population during 1979 to 1984 experienced substantial contemporaneous (relative) increases in the labor force participation of high school dropout males. During this five-year interval, a one-tenth of a percentage point decline in disability receipt is associated with a rise in male high school dropout labor force participation of six-tenths of a percentage point.
320~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~High School Dropout Labor Force Participation and Disbability Insurance Receipt Rates~…male high school dropouts average 7.9% of the labor force over 1984 to 1998 (CPS data) and comprised 25% of all disability recipients in 1999 (SIPP data).
320~D1, D4~F9~Findings~Median Potential DI Earnings Replacement Rate Across States~…the median potential DI earnings replacement rate of currently employed males in 1978 ranged from a low of 18% in Alaska to a high of 38% in South Carolina, with a cross-state standard deviation of 2.6 points. The first stage coefficients confirm that per-capita changes in DI rolls were substantially more negative in high replacement-rate states during 1978 to 1984 and, converesely, were substantially more positive in 1984 to 1998. The interpretation of the first-stage coefficient is that for each additional percentage point of replacement rate in 1978, state disability rolls fell by 0.077 recipients per 1000 nonelderly adults per year during 1978-1984.
320~V17~L1~Variable Value~Unemployed~…unemployment is a de facto precondition for disability application, making the opportunity cost of seeking DI benefits higher for employed worker than for job losers and nonparticipants.
320~V17~L1~Variable Value~Unemployed~…individuals may be in one of three states in each period including employed; unemployed and seeking work; and seeking or receiving DI benefits.

320~V32~L16~Variable Value~Termination By Medical Disqualification~…the annual rate of DI benefit termination by medical disqualification.
320~V16~L17~Variable Value~Drug and Alcohol Addiction~…in 1996, Congress discontinued benefits for individuals who qualified for disability on the basis of alcohol and drug addiction, resulting in the termination of approximately 130,000 beneficiaries.
320~V17~L18~Variable Value~Employed~…individuals may be in one of three states in each period including employed; unemployed and seeking work; and seeking or receiving DI benefits.
320~V17~L18~Variable Value~Employed~…employed workers face a per-period hazard s of job loss.

320~V17~L19~Variable Value~Not Participating~…as an alternative to employment, individuals may seek DI benefits.
320~V13~L2~Variable Value~30-39~…one of five detailed age groups of interest in the current research.
320~V22~L20~Variable Value~Conditional Application~"…many potential beneficiaries will seek benefits in the even of job loss but not otherwise. Researchers call these potential benficiaries ""conditional applicants. The size of this conditional group is likely to be relatively elastict to program and labor market conditions."
320~V22~L20~Variable Value~Conditional Application~…apply for DI benefits conditional on job loss, C, as one of the three decision rules that a worker may pursue.
320~V22~L20~Variable Value~Conditional Application~"…note that after sufficient time elapses, all ""conditional applicants"" exit the labor force, at which point the program exerts no further effect on their labor force participation. It is therefore appropriate to think of the model as applying to a single cohort of workers, with new cohorts entering the market in each period."
320~V22~L20~Variable Value~Conditional Application~…conditional application is likely to be elastic to three forces: benefits supply, benefits demand, and the interaction of the two.
320~V22~L21~Variable Value~Immediate Application~…apply for DI benefits immediately, I, as one of the three decision rules that a worker may pursue.
320~V22~L21~Variable Value~Immediate Application~…note that if a worker selects this policy, she will find it optimal to quit employment immediately, to reapply for benefits if rejected, and to remain a beneficiary in perpetuity once accepted.
320~V22~L21~Variable Value~Immediate Application~…direct quits are only elastic to the benefits supply and, in general, are less elastic than conditional application.
320~V22~L22~Variable Value~No Application~…remain in the labor force after job loss, R, as one of the three decision rules that a worker may pursue.
320~V22~L22~Variable Value~No Application~…workers pursuing this policy seek reemployment (not DI benefits) after job loss.
320~DV15~L23~Variable Value~Of Receiving DI Benefits~…u(d) is the per period utility of receiving DI benefits.

320~V34~L35~Variable Value~High School Dropout~…to attain comparable educational categories across the redefinition of Census's Bureau's education variable introduced in the 1992 CPS, researchers use the method proposed by Jaeger [1997]. In particular, prior to 1992, researchers define high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling. In 1993 forward, researchers define high school dropouts as those without a high school diploma or GED certificate.

320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…researchers write a simple dynamic programming model to explore how elastic responses to supply and demand of benefits - exit after shocks or direct quits - are likely to be shifts in the supply of benefits.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…researchers compare steady states of a discrete time Markov model in which individuals may be in one of three states in each period: employed; unemployed and seeking work; and seeking or receving DI benefits (not participating).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…it is appropriate to think of the model as applying to a single cohort of workers, with new cohorts entering the market in each period.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…researchers begin the empirical analysis by exploiting the disability retrenchment of 1979-1984 and subsequent liberalization of 1984-1998 to study the impacts of shifts in the supply of disability benefits on labor force participation.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~"…a disadvantage of the current focus on steady states is that researchers do not model the labor market impacts of unanticipated chnages in parameter values that may induce immediate labor force exits that would not be visible in equilibrium. Consequently, the current model should not be taken to imply that the impact of DI benefits on direct quits is negligible, only that the response of ""conditional"" applications is likely to be more elastic than direct exits."
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the conditional expecation of labor force participation is calculated with the dependent variable a dichotomous variable equal to one if an individual is a labor force participant, and explanatory variables including the opportunity wage, health, and a vector of individual characteristics. Equation (6).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the coefficient of interest in this equation is the impact of potential benefits on labor force participation.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…there are a number of difficulties in estimating this equation with individual level data. Researchers cannot typically observe both d and w for a given individual; objective measures of h are normally not available from survey data; and because individuals with poor health typically experience declining wages and hence rising potential DI replacement rates, omission of h will bias estimates of the impact of potential benefits on labor force participation. An additional difficulty is the possibility of unmeasured compositional shifts in the high school dropout population, which declined from 26 to 12 percent of overall population during 1979-1998. To (imperfectly) account for composition, researchers control for high school dropout age structure in each state in all models.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…all estimates changes control for changes in the age distribution in the state population for changes in the age distribution in the state population for the relevant gender/education group (ages 25 to 39 and 40 to 54 with 55 to 64 omitted). Age controls are demeaned in each time period. Estimates are weighted by mean state share of U.S. populaiton in the two years used to form the dependent variable.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…the ordinary least-squares estimates will be biased if shift in the supply of benefits due to program retrenchment are correlated with state-level shifts in the demand for benefits (due, for example, to earnings and health shocks).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…to test the implication that reduced screening stringency, rising replacement rates, and declining demand for low-skilled workers should have raised the relative attractiveness of DI application and labor froce exit for workers facing adverse shocks, researchers require a measure of plausibly exogenous labor demand shocks. Following the approach of related literature, researchers exploit cross-state differences in industrial composition and national-level cahnges in employment to predict individual state employment growth. The predicted log employment change, n(jT) is calculated for each state between years t and T where n(kt) is the log change in two-digit industry k's employment share nationally and y(jkt) is the share of state employment in industry k in state j in the initial year. This methodology predicts what each state's change in employment would be if industry level employment changes occured uniformly across states and state-level industrial composition was fixed in the short term. 
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…researchers consider a modified form of equation (6) in which they write the conditional exectation of DI application for a displaced worker where g(.) represents the disability supply function. This method is estimated using state-level data. Here, the move from individual to aggregate data is less straightfoward. Equation (9).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M1~Methodology~Probit~…to potentially improve upon the precision of estimates, researchers reestimate the models using stacked data (for the periods 78-81, 81-84, 84-87, 87-90, 90-93, 93-96, and 95-98, on application flows and projected demand shocks by state at three-year intervals.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers write a simple dynamic programming model to explore how elastic responses to supply and demand of benefits - exit after shocks or direct quits - are likely to be shifts in the supply of benefits.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers compare steady states of a discrete time Markov model in which individuals may be in one of three states in each period: employed; unemployed and seeking work; and seeking or receving DI benefits (not participating).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…it is appropriate to think of the model as applying to a single cohort of workers, with new cohorts entering the market in each period.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers begin the empirical analysis by exploiting the disability retrenchment of 1979-1984 and subsequent liberalization of 1984-1998 to study the impacts of shifts in the supply of disability benefits on labor force participation.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~"…a disadvantage of the current focus on steady states is that researchers do not model the labor market impacts of unanticipated chnages in parameter values that may induce immediate labor force exits that would not be visible in equilibrium. Consequently, the current model should not be taken to imply that the impact of DI benefits on direct quits is negligible, only that the response of ""conditional"" applications is likely to be more elastic than direct exits."
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…to surmount some the biases associated with the probit regressions, researchers estimate a state-level analog of the probit regressions in first differences where j subscripts the 50 U.S. states excluding the District of Columbia and [delta](T) denotes the first difference operator over years t and T. As a proxy fort changes in the supply of disability benefits researchers initially use the observed contemporaneous state-level changes in DI recipients per 1000 nonelderly population ages 25 to 64 ([delta](DI)(jT). This measure is subsequently instrumented. Since SSA does not report the educational attainment of DI beneficiaries, researchers use the total count of nonelderly recipients by state. These first difference regressions are estimated using OLS. Here, the dependent variable is the state-level annualized percentage point change in the labor force participation rate of the relevant demographic subgroup calculate from the merged monthly files of the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1978 to 1998.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…analogous first difference models also control for the age distribution of the relevant demographic subgroups. Researchers initially assume that, conditional on age and education, average wage and health changes are common across states and hence allow them to be absorbed by a.

Age controls are demeaned in each time period. Estimates are weighted by mean state share of U.S. populaiton in the two years used to form the dependent variable.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…the ordinary least-squares estimates will be biased if shift in the supply of benefits due to program retrenchment are correlated with state-level shifts in the demand for benefits (due, for example, to earnings and health shocks).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers model labor force exit through this method. In this equation declines in labor force participation come from two sources: workers who withdraw from the labor force but do not seek DI benefits; and job losers who leave the labor force to seek DI benefits. As the equation underscores, the data do not permit a direct estimate of the parameter of interest in (9). Instead, estimates of (11) will yield a reduced form that combines both sources of labor force exit. Equation (11) and (12).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers estimate equations (10) and (12) separately in both the pre- and post-DI liberalization eras to obtain estimates of the change in the responsiveness of DI applications and labor force exit to demand shocks of given magnitude. With these estimates, one may distinguish three cases. First, if DI application sensitivity has risen but labor force exit propensity has not, this would suggest that rising DI benefits supply has increased program take-up but not impacted labor force exit. Conversely if the change in the responsivness is around 0 and the change in labor force exit is greater than 0, this would indicate that labor force exit has risen for given shocks but that this change is unrelated to the supply of DI benefits. Finally, if the change in the responsivness equals the change in labor force exit which is greater than 0, application and labor force exit propensity have risen conformably, researchers will view this as evidence that the rising supply of DI benefits has increased the propensity of adversely shocked workers to withdraw from the labor force to apply for DI benefits. A limitation of this approach is that it does not separately identify the impact of rising replacement rates and decling screening stringency on labor force exit propensity.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…to potentially improve upon the precision of estimates, researchers reestimate the models using stacked data (for the periods 78-81, 81-84, 84-87, 87-90, 90-93, 93-96, and 95-98, on application flows and projected demand shocks by state at three-year intervals.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…presents a variant of the model in which researchers estimate the impact of changes in the overall high school dropout employment to population ratio on DI application flows while instrumenting high school dropout employment with the projected demand shock measure.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers distinguish the possible causes for rising DI application sensitivity for given shocks by estimating (12) using projected demand shocks to instrument for net employment losses at the state level. Using the identify that the change in the employment to population ratio is equal to the change in the negative unemployment to population minus the change in the NILF to population ratio, researchers can decompose the impact of employment shocks into the component accruing to unemployment and the component accruing to labor force exit. To facilitate comparison to the DI application regressions, the results of these regresssions are presented for both male and female high school dropouts combined and disaggregated. Estimates are weighted by state share of U.S. population in each year.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…to control for persistent state trends in labor force exit that would bias the results if correlated with the demand shock measure, researchesr add state fixed effects to model in columns (2), (6), and (8) of equation (12) regressions. Their addition has little impact on the pattern of estimates. To further explore robustness, columns (7) and (8) pool data for 1978 to 1998, adding an interaction between the employment loss measure and a post-1984 dummy variable.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…to test the possibility that differential cross-state health trends could be in part responsible for the findings in this research, an objective health measure is exploited: the mortality rate among state residents ages 25 to 64. Researchers control for both levels and changes of this measure since each should impact the response of state DI rolls to a reduction in DI screening stringency.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…because less-educated immigrants typically have greater labor force attachment than native-born high school dropouts and are not eligible for disability benefits until five years after arrival, geographically concentrated immigrant inflows during the 1980s and 1990s could induce negative cross-state correlations between high school dropout labor force participation and DI receipt.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…because the incarcerated population is included in neither the numerator nor denominator of the current labor force calculations, it is not intrinsically a source of bias. However, potential criminas have below average rates of labor force participation relative to other high school dropouts. If states with low DI growth also experienced differential increases in incarceration over 1984 to 1998, this would bias the estimates.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M2~Methodology~First Differences~…researchers present two sets of estimates with the alternative explantory variables. Table VII shows the relationship between each measure and the annualized percentage point growth in DI rolls per nonelderly state population over 1984 to 1998. Table VIII presents analogous estimates for the annualized change in high school dropout labor force participation in the same period. Because results are for the most part comparable for the two dependent variables, researchers discuss them in combination. The first three columns in each table include the two main explanatory variables: DI replacement rates (as a proxy for shifts in DI benefits supply) and projected employment shocks. Subsequent columns of Tables VII and VIII explore the relationship between the two outcome measures and the other candidate variables, each entered in combination with the replacement rate. The final specifications in each table combine groups of candidate variables shown to be significant in previous columns.

Equation (10).

Conversely if the change in the responsivness is around 0 and the change in labor force exit is greater than 0, this would indicate that labor force exit has risen for given shocks but that this change is unrelated to the supply of DI benefits. Finally, if the change in the responsivness equals the change in labor force exit which is greater than 0, application and labor force exit propensity have risen conformably, researchers will view this as evidence that the rising supply of DI benefits has increased the propensity of adversely shocked workers to withdraw from the labor force to apply for DI benefits. A limitation of this approach is that it does not separately identify the impact of rising replacement rates and decling screening stringency on labor force exit propensity.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least Squares~…the dependent variable in equation (10) is the annualized state level flow of unique DI applications per capita during 1978 to 1984 and 1984 to 1998. The independent variable is the annualized projected state log employment shock measure for the corresponding time interval. Models also include time dummies and control for changes in the age and gender distribution of nonelderly adult state residents. Researchers initially make the assumption that wage and helath variables are uncorrelated with employment shocks but examine their impact directly.

320~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1984-2001~"…between 1984 and 2001, the share of nonelderly adults receiving Social Security Disability Insurance income (DI) rose by 60% to 5.3 million beneficiaries. Over the past two decades, two important changes have impacted eligibility and generosity for this program. The first, occuring in 1984, liberalized the disability determination processs, reversing a dramatic reduction in disability rolls underways. The second occurred more gradually. Because the DI benefits formula is progressive and indexed to the mean wage in the economy, the widening dispersion of earnings during the 1980s and 1990s substantially raised the ratio of disability income to prior earnings (the ""replacement rate"") for low-skilled workers, a trend augmented by the rising real value of medical benefits provided. Contemporaneously, the share of nonelderly adults receiving DI income rose by more than 60% from its 1984 trough to 3.7% of the adult population ages 25 to 64. Relative to prior DI cohorts, new entrants were younger and substantially more likely to suffer from low mortality impairments, particularly pain and mental disorders."
320~D1, D3~T1~Time Period~1984-2001~…responding to the backlash in labor force, Congress passed legislation in 1984 that profoundly altered the disability determination system, yielding a broader definition of disability and providing applicants and medical providers with greater opportunity to influence the decision process. The SSA was required to 1) relax its strict screening of mental illness by placing less weight on diagnostic and medical factors and relatively more on functional factors, such as ability to function in a work or worklike setting; 2) consider source evidence provided by the applicant's own health care provider prior to the results of SSA consultative examination; 3) give additional weight to pain and related factors; 4) consider multiple nonsevere impairments as constituting a disability during the initial determination (whereas prior to 1984, applicants were automatically denied awards during the initial determination if all impairments were judged to be nonsevere); 5) desist from terminating benefits for any individual for whom SSA could not demonstrate substantial evidence of medical improvement; 6) provide benefits for these former recipients whose terminations were under appeal; and 7) suspend Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) for mental impairments, and paint until appropriate guidelines could be developed.
320~D1, D4~T1~Time Period~1984-2001~…in the post-1984 period, two additional administrative factors affected applications and terminations. In 1991, due to successful court challenges to SSA's treatment of source evidence, regulations were adopted placing further weight on the information provided by an SSI or DI applicant's own medical provider. Finally, agency downsizing during the 1980s and increased claims workload in the 1990s resulted in a substantial decrease in the frequency of CDRs during 1989-1993.

In each year between 1951 and 1998, researchers calculate the tenth, twenty-fifth, fiftieth, seventy-fifth, and ninetieth percentile of earnings for males at each age 25 to 61 inclusive to construct an age-year earnings file with 1776 observations (48 years, 37 ages).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4~T2~Time Period~1978-1998~…in the current essay, researchers study the impact of the supply and demand for DI benefits on the labor force behavior of low-skilled workers during the period of 1978-1998.
320~D1~T2~Time Period~1978-1998~…the survey period from which Current Population Survey data is drawn.
320~D2, D7~T3~Time Period~1976-1980~…during the late 1970s, concern over swelling disability rolls spurred the Social Security Administration to tighten medical eligibility criteria and exercise greater control over the state boards that interpret SSA's elibility standards The fraction of applicants awarded benefits fell from 45% in 1976 to 32% in 1980. Augmenting this adminstrative action, Congress passed legislation in 1980 mandating that SSA conduct more frequent beneficiary health reassessments known as Continuing Disability Reviews. In the sugbsequent years, SSA determined that more than 380,000 DI beneficiaries -- 40% of those whose cases were reviwed -- no longer met medical standards and terminated their benefits. Congress also required the Social Security Administration to further tighten medical criteria, accelerating the decline in award rates.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~T4~Time Period~1983-1984~…the large-scale curtailment of benefits occurring during the depest postwar U.S. recession, wax met with intense public criticism Citing violations of due process, seventeen states refuesed to comply with the DI review effort during 1983 and 1984.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~T5~Time Period~1982-1986~…despite improving economic conditions, the number of DI awards increased by one-third from its 1982 trough to a 1986 peak (the highest level reached during the 1980s).
320~D1, D2, D4~T6~Time Period~1985-1989~…in the five years from 1985 through 1989, SSA terminated fewer individuals for failing to meet medical eligibility standards than it had terminated in the first five months of 1982.
320~D2, D4~T7~Time Period~1979-1995~…between 1979 and 1995, real weekly earnings of full-time, full-year workers with less than a high school degree fell by 19.1 percentage points, while the Social Security Administration's mean wage series increased by 21.6 percentage points in real wage terms.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~T8~Time Period~1979-1984~…this time span constitutes a period of disability retrenchment.

The first, occuring in 1984, liberalized the disability determination processs, reversing a dramatic reduction in disability rolls underways. The second occurred more gradually. Because the DI benefits formula is progressive and indexed to the mean wage in the economy, the widening dispersion of earnings during the 1980s and 1990s substantially raised the ratio of disability income to prior earnings (the ""replacement rate"") for low-skilled workers, a trend augmented by the rising real value of medical benefits provided."
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…the objective of this paper is to assess how the programmatic changes to the Social Security Disability Insurance program - reduced screening stringency and a rising replacement rate -interacted with decling demand for less-skilled workers to impact labor force participation of the low skilled during the period of 1978 to 1998. 
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~"…the focus question of this essay is intrinsically difficult for three reasons. DI is for the most part a uniformly administered federal program, makng for limited treatment-control comparions. Additionally, while aggregate health improved during the past two decades, reduced DI screening stringency coincided with a period of declining labor market opportunities for less-skilled workers, making it likely that demand for benefits (as a form of income replacement) rose while benefits supply was shifting outward. Finally, the administrative definition of disability - the instability to ""engage in a substantial gainful activity"" - ensures that holding health constant, disability beneftis are easier to obtain when job opportunities are scarcer."
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…the current framework implies that reduced DI screening stringency, rising replacement rates, and slackening demand for low-skilled workers should have raised the propensity of workers facing an adverse demand shock to exit the labor force to seek disability benefits.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~"…the federal government provides cash and medical benefits to the disabled through the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. This program requires a medically determinable impairment that prevents the applicant from engaging in any ""substantial gain ful activity""."
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…DI benefits, which are not means tested, are set according to a recipient's prior earnings history. To obtain benefits, applicants provide detailed medical income, and asset information to a federal Social Security Administration (SSA) office, which make the disability determination. Individuals currently in the labor force are not normally eligible for disability benefits.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…responding to the backlash in labor force, Congress passed legislation in 1984 that profoundly altered the disability determination system, yielding a broader definition of disability and providing applicants and medical providers with greater opportunity to influence the decision process.

320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~"…determination of an individual's DI benefit proceeds in two steps. First, the beneficiary's Average Indexed Monthy Earnings (AIME) is computed contingent on the individual's average monthly earnings. Second, the benefit awarded, the ""Primary Insurance Amount"" (PIA), is computed from the AIME using a piecewise linear formula where the ""bend points"" (b1, b2) are also rescaled each year by average wage growth in the economy. Indexation of the benefit formula to the mean wage in the economy ensures that benefit levels keep pace with aggregate earnings growth. In addition, approximately the lowest five years of earnings are discarded and quarters with earnings in excess of that period's taxable Social Security maximum are truncated at the cap. Once the DI benefit is awarded, annual cost-of-living increases are tied to the Consumer Price Index."
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…approximately one-fourth of DI recipients also receive funds from Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI). Though the two programs have many overlaps, researchers focus on DI because by design, it has far more interaction with labor force participants.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…the DI benefits formula is progressive (i.e. concave), ensuring that low-wage workers replace a greater share of income.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…researchers use equation (2) of the text to estimate potential DI benefits as a funciton of the AIME. The final two DI calculations add average Medicare expenditures for DI beneficiaries in the relevant year to the Di benefit amount and scale earnings to account for average fringe benefit rates for individuals at each of the five earnings percentiles using data from Pierce (2001).

320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…although it is possible that some DI applicants collect unemployment insurance benefits during the application process, this is technically illegal and likely rare since UI beneficiaries must demonstrate that they are active job seekers. UI recipients may of course seek DI benefits when UI is exhausted.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…to isolate the component of variation in DI rolls that is due to benefits supply, researchers exploit the progressivity of the DI benefits formula. This fomula does not account for variation in regional wage levels and thus gives rise to substantial cross-state variation in potential replacement rates.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V1~Variable~Disability Benefits~…in the post-1984 period, two additional administrative factors affected applications and terminations. In 1991, due to successful court challenges to SSA's treatment of source evidence, regulations were adopted placing further weight on the information provided by an SSI or DI applicant's own medical provider.

320~D1, D2, D3, D4~V16~Variable~Qualifying Impairment~…the distribution of qualifying impairments of DI awardes to five-year intervpals (1983, 1999).
320~D1, D2, D3, D4~V16~Variable~Qualifying Impairment~…the disability insurance benefits are categorized by the disability for which the individual is being rewarded benefits for.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4~V16~Variable~Qualifying Impairment~…the share of DI awardees with a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder or a disease of the musculo-skeletal system (typically back pain increased by 60% between 1983 and 1999. The corresponding award shares for neoplasms (cancers) and circulatory system diseases (primarily heart disease) declined by 40%.
320~D1, D3~V17~Variable~Labor Force Status~…exploiting the combination of instruments, researchers study the impact of the supply and demand for DI benefits on the labor force behavior of low-skilled workers during the period of 1978-1998.
320~D1, D3~V17~Variable~Labor Force Status~…researchers compare steady states of a discrete time Markov model in which individuals may be in one of three states in each period.
320~D1, D9~V18~Variable~Health~…the health status of an individual is denoted by the covariate h.
320~D1, D9~V18~Variable~Health~…to simplify the analysis, researchers restrict attention to the case in which h is time varying.
320~D1, D9~V18~Variable~Health~…health status as a factor in computing the conditional expectation of labor force participation.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V19~Variable~Immediate Application Group Size~…changes in labor market conditions do not impact the size of the group that quits employment immediately to seek benefits (I). It bears emphasis that this result - that direct quits are not influenced by labor market conditions - arises in part from the assumption that w is fixed; workers keep their current wage until job loss. While this assumption is clearly too strong, it is qualitatively consistent with well-known evidence that wages of incumbent workers are substantially more sheltered from labor market conditions that those of job seekers.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V19~Variable~Immediate Application Group Size~…increases in the supply of benefits and the probability of qualification shift the value of immediate and conditional application rightward, raising the total share of workers who eventually seek benefits, both immediately and after job loss.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V20~Variable~Conditional Application Group Size~…because higher values of the hazard of job loss and the hazard of reemployment reduce the value of job search, more adverse labor market conditions increase the share of workers applying for benefits in the event of job loss, policy.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V20~Variable~Conditional Application Group Size~…increases in the supply of benefits and the probability of qualification shift the value of immediate and conditional application rightward, raising the total share of workers who eventually seek benefits, both immediately and after job loss.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V20~Variable~Conditional Application Group Size~…provided that the density of v is weakly increasing between the previous immediate/conditional locus and the new conditional/remain locus (as would be the case if the distribution of v were uniform), the size of the conditional applicant group will rise relative to the size of the immediate applicant group.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V20~Variable~Conditional Application Group Size~…it is straightfoward to show using the cross-partial derivatives of the locus of conditional/remain and immediate/conditional that an increase in the supply of benefits interacts positvely with adverse labor market conditions to increase the relative size fo the conditional applicant group. The more generous are program benefits or the less stringent is program screening, the more that adverse labor market conditions increase the size of the conditional group (and vice versa).
320~D1~V21~Variable~High School Dropout Age Structure~…to (imperfectly) account for composition, researchers control for high school dropout age structure in each state in all models.
320~D1~V21~Variable~High School Dropout Age Structure~…since high school dropouts comprise a far larger share of the disability recipient population than their share in the workforce, this coefficient is of reasonable magnitude.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V22~Variable~Policies~…an employed individual must choose one of three decision rules.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V22~Variable~Policies~"…a disadvantage of the current focus on steady states is that researchers do not model the labor market impacts of unanticipated chnages in parameter values that may induce immediate labor force exits that would not be visible in equilibrium. Consequently, the current model should not be taken to imply that the impact of DI benefits on direct quits is negligible, only that the response of ""conditional"" applications is likely to be more elastic than direct exits."
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V23~Variable~Expected Time from Quit to Award~…the expected time from quit to award as used in discounting further the discounted value of permanent benefits receipts in order to determine the asset value of immediate application.
320~D1~V24~Variable~LFP~…a dichotomous variable equal to one if an individual is a labor force participant as a factor in computing the conditional expectation of labor force participation.
320~D1, D2, D4~V25~Variable~State~…j indexes for all 50 U.S. states, excluding the District of Columbia.
320~D1, D4~V26~Variable~Industry~…k denotes industry.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~V27~Variable~Time~…model (10) includes time dummies.
320~D1, D2, D4~V28~Variable~Age Distribution~…model (10) includes controls for changes in the age distribution of nonelderly adult state residents.
320~D1, D2, D4~V29~Variable~Gender Distribution~…model (10) includes controls for changes in the gender distribution of nonelderly adult state residents.
320~D1, D2, D3~V3~Variable~Direct Employment to Disability Transitions~…direct employment to disability transitions will be relatively inelastic.
320~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~V30~Variable~Post-1984~…equation (10) estimates that pool data for the entire time period add an interaction between the shock measure and a post-1984 dummy variable.
320~D1, D2, D4~V31~Variable~State Fixed Effects~…to control for persistent state trends in labor force exit that would bias the results if correlated with the demand shock measure, researchesr add state fixed effects to model in columns (2), (6), and (8) of equation (12) regressions. Their addition has little impact on the pattern of estimates.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V32~Variable~Termination Rate~…by using average termination rates in computing steady state population, the calculation does not adjust for the fact that more recent DI entrants are likely to have lower mortality and retirement rates than incumbent recipients.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V32~Variable~Termination Rate~…the termination rate.
320~D7~V33~Variable~Number of New Awards~…A is the number of new awards.
320~D7~V33~Variable~Number of New Awards~…A is equal to the P* measure multiplied by the termination rate.
320~D1~V34~Variable~Education~…to attain comparable educational categories across the redefinition of Census's Bureau's education variable introduced in the 1992 CPS, researchers use the method proposed by Jaeger [1997]. 
320~D1~V35~Variable~Usual Hours Worked~…for workers employed in the survey reference week, wages were calculated by dividing usual weekly earnings by usual weekly hours.
320~D1~V36~Variable~Usual Weekly Earnings~…for workers employed in the survey reference week, wages were calculated by dividing usual weekly earnings.
320~D1, D2, D4~V37~Variable~Taxable Earnings~…taxable earnings for an m year old Nth percentile worker in year t where t is equal to T - (M - m).
320~D1, D2, D4~V38~Variable~Earnings Percentiles~…in each year between 1951 and 1998, researchers calculate the tenth, twenty-fifth, fiftieth, seventy-fifth, and ninetieth percentile of earnings for males at each age 25 to 61 inclusive to construct an age-year earnings files with 1776 observations (48 y
320~D9~V4~Variable~Mortality Rates~…as an alternative explanation for the observed labor force exit of less-skilled workers, researchers explore the importance of changing mortality rates.
320~D9~V4~Variable~Mortality Rates~…a 4-year mortality rate computed base on qualifying impairment due to disability.
320~D9~V4~Variable~Mortality Rates~…to test the possibility that differential cross-state health trends could be in part response for the findings in this research, an objective health measures is exploited: the mortality rate (excluding accidental deahts and homicides) among state residents ages 25 to 64. Researchers control for both levels and changes of this measure since each should impact the response of state DI rolls to a reduction in DI screening stringency.
320~D9~V4~Variable~Mortality Rates~…mortality rates declined by one-quarter between 1984 and 1998.
320~D9~V4~Variable~Mortality Rates~…mortality rate is the number of nonaccidental, nonhomicidal deaths among ages 25 to 64 divided by the average of state population 25 to 64 in the previous and current year.
320~D9~V4~Variable~Mortality Rates~…the rate of nonaccidental, nonhomicidal mortality among state residents ages 25 to 64 is calculated using mortality data from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [1984, 1998].
320~D1, D10~V5~Variable~Immigration Rates~…as an alternative explanation for the observed labor force exit of less-skilled workers, researchers explore the importance of rising immigration rates.
320~D1, D10~V5~Variable~Immigration Rates~…because less-educated immigrants typically have greater labor force attachment than native-born high school dropouts and are not eligible for disability benefits until five years after arrival, geographically concentrated immigrant inflows during the 1980s and 1990s could induce negative cross-state correlations between high school dropout labor force participation and DI receipt.
320~D1, D10~V5~Variable~Immigration Rates~…researchers measure nonelderly foreign-born population using data from the 1980 and 1990 Census of Populations and the 1998 CPS.
320~D1, D10~V5~Variable~Immigration Rates~…the foreign-born share of nonelderly adults rose by close to 5 percentage points during 1984 to 1998, with sizable cross-state variation.
320~D1, D10~V5~Variable~Immigration Rates~…nonelderly foreign-born populations by state for 1984 and 1998 are estimated using data from the 1980 and 1990 Census of Popuations and the 1998 CPS. Prior to 1994, the CPS did not collect information on nativity, and hence, researchers linearly interpolate 1984 state levels using the 1980 and 1990 integrated Census Public Use Micro-samples (IPUMS) 1 percent files.
320~D5~V6~Variable~Incarceration Rates~…as an alternative explanation for the observed labor force exit of less-skilled workers, researchers explore the importance of rising incarceration rates.
320~D5~V6~Variable~Incarceration Rates~…because the incarcerated population is included in neither the numerator nor denominator of the current labor force calculations, it is not intrinsically a source of bias. However, potential criminas have below average rates of labor force participation relative to other high school dropouts. If states with low DI growth also experienced differential increases in incarceration over 1984 to 1998, this would bias the estimates.
320~D5~V6~Variable~Incarceration Rates~…researchers assemble Bureau of Justice Statistics data on state prison populations (excluding local jails), denominated by state population ages 18 to 64.
320~D5~V6~Variable~Incarceration Rates~…consistent with other authors, researchers find that incarceration rates rose by a sizable 0.46 percentage point during 1984 to 1998.
320~D5~V6~Variable~Incarceration Rates~…incarceration rate data are calculated using Bureau of Justice Statistics data on state prison populations excluding local jails denominated by state population ages 18 to 64 from the Current Population Survey. 
320~D6~V7~Variable~UI Benefits~…as an alternative explanation for the observed labor force exit of less-skilled workers, researchers explore the importance of fluctuations in UI benefits.
320~D6~V7~Variable~UI Benefits~…although it is possible that some DI applicants collect unemployment insurance benefits during the application process, this is technically illegal and likely rare since UI beneficiaries must demonstrate that they are active job seekers. UI recipients may of course seek DI benefits when UI is exhausted.
320~D6~V7~Variable~UI Benefits~…the UI system provides an alternative (albeit short-term) source of wage replacement for displaced workers, relative to the DI insurance program.
320~D6~V7~Variable~UI Benefits~…declines in the value of UI benefits during the 1980s and 1990s could potentially induce displaced workers to seek DI instead.
320~D2, D4, D7~V8~Variable~Supplemental Security Income~"…the federal government provides cash and medical benefits to the disabled through the Supplemental Security Income program. This program requires a medically determinable impairment that prevents the applicant from engaging in any ""substantial gain ful activity""."
320~D2, D4, D7~V8~Variable~Supplemental Security Income~…SSI benefits are means-tested and do not require prior work history. To obtain benefits, applicants provide detailed medical income, and asset information to a federal Social Security Administration (SSA) office, which make the disability determination. Individuals currently in the labor force are not normally eligible for disability benefits.
320~D2, D4, D7~V8~Variable~Supplemental Security Income~…approximately one-fourth of DI recipients also receive funds from Supplemental Security Insurance which is an entitlement program rather than a labor income insurance system. Though the two programs have many overlaps, the researchers focus on DI because by desgn, it has far more interaction with labor force participants.
320~D2, D4, D7~V8~Variable~Supplemental Security Income~…SSI is an entitlement program rather than a labor income insurance system.
320~D1, D2, D4, D7~V9~Variable~Discount Factor~…researchers assume a discount factor of [beta] < 1.
323~323: The Role of World War II in the rise of Women's Employment~~~~
323~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
323~D1, D3~T1~Time Period~1890-1990~…the proportion of married women engaged in paid work in the United States increased more than tenfold during the past century, from less than 5% in 1890 to more than 60% in 1990. Much of this increased employment occurred in the years after 1940.
323~D1, D2, D3~T2~Time Period~1940-1950~…the participation rate of white, married women 45 to 54 years old was 10.1% in 1940 but 22.2% in 1950.
323~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rate~…information from two retrospective surveys, one in 1944 and another in 1951, are used here to understand precisely how married women's employment evolved during the 1940', particularly among the older age-groups.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~"…marital status in 1940 and 1947 is from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1948; marital status in 1944 is from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1952; married 1950 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1951. The labor-force data for ""all marital statuses"" are from Goldin (1990 table 5); the adjusted figure for 1940 was used."
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…the population for 1944 was derived by extrapolation from census data for 1940 and 1950.
323~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Population~…the population for 1944 was derived by extrapolation from census data for 1940 and 1950.
323~D1, D2~T3~Time Period~1941-1948~…the average hourly wage of female manufacturing workers across 25 industries rose relative to that for male workers by almost 20% from 1941 to 1948.
323~D1, D2~T4~Time Period~1944-1945~…the earnings premium for war-related over consumer-related manufacturing was between 25% and 45% in 1944/1945, depending on the war production area.
323~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Earnings Premium~…the earnings premium for war-related over consumer-related manufacturing.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…the 1975 U.S. Bureau of the Census is the source of historic average hourly wage trend data for female manufacturing workers.
323~D3~D3~Dataset~U.S. Department of Labor~…the 1946 U.S. Department of Labor is the source of earnings premium data for war-related over consumer-related manufacturing.
323~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Marriage Bars~…the stated policies of firms, school districts, governments, and other organizations not to hire married women and to fire single women upon marriage.
323~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Marriage Bars~…these bars were instituted before the 1930's but were greatly expanded during the Depression. The bars vanished sometime after the early 1940's and by the 1950's were rarely encountered.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…a data set of retrospective work histories for 4,350 women, working full-time for at least one month in 1950, which has much of the information needed to explore the role of World War II in the working lives of American women.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…a complementary set of data to the Palmer Survey, in tabular form only and contained in Women's Bureau Special Bulletin No. 20 (U.S. Department of Labor, 1944), are from a special question asked in a March 1944 survey by the Bureau of the Census of 30,000 households (a precursor of the Current Population Survey [CPS]). Women's Bureau Special Bulletin No. 20 did not list the official name of the census survey, but it seems likely that it was excevcuted by the Current Surveys Section of the Bureau of the Census and later became the Current Population Survey.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…the individual-level data come from a study directed by Gladys L. Palmer (1954), with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau of the Census, that assessed labor turnover and geographic mobility in the 1940's. Coded versions of the original schedules, located at the University of Pennsylvania, have been put in machine-readable form. The data give information on the work histories of a probability-based sample of urban women in the United States from January 1940 to the date of enumberation, January 1951.
323~D2~T5~Time Period~1940-1951~…the Palmer data gives information on the work histories of a probability-based sample of urban women in the United States from January 1940 to the date of enumeration, January 1951.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…the original Palmer study also surveyed more than 9,000 men, and the schedules for bothe men and women will be archived at Temple University Urban Archives.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…the Palmer Survey, funded by the U.S. Air Force, was intended to provide the Air Force with information about manpower requirements in the face of occupational, industrial, and geographic mobility. The population sampling design of the April 1947 Metropolitan Area Surveys of the Burea of the Census was used. Six cities were included for study: two in the East (New Haven and Philadelphia), two in the Midwest (Chicago and St. Paul), and two in the West (Los Angeles and San Francisco).
323~D2~V2~Variable~City~…six cities were included for study in the Palmer Survey: two in the East, two in the Midwest, and two in the West.
323~V2~L1~Variable Value~New Haven~…one of two Eastern cities studied in the Palmer Survey.
323~V2~L2~Variable Value~Philadelphia~…one of two Eastern cities studied in the Palmer Survey.
323~V2~L3~Variable Value~Chicago~…one of two Midwestern cities studied in the Palmer Survey.
323~V2~L4~Variable Value~St. Paul~…one of two Midwestern cities studied in the Palmer Survey.
323~V2~L5~Variable Value~Los Angeles~…one of two Western cities studied in the Palmer Survey.
323~V2~L6~Variable Value~San Francisco~…one of two Western cities studied in the Palmer Survey.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…the coded schedules summarize much of the data in the original surveys, and the information they contain can be grouped into two categories: retrospective and contemporaneous. Among the retrospective variables are the occupation and industry of work (if the woman was in the labor force) as of January 1940, December 1944, December 1949, and January 1951. Occupation and industry are also given for the longest job in 1950, the longest job over the work history, the longest job from 1940 to 1949, and the woman's first job. Summary information is provided on months in the labor force from January 1940 to December 1949, the number of jobs during the same period, and the date at which work began prior to 1940. Variables pertaining to the individual as of January 1951, which might be called contemporaneous variables, include weekly earnings at the longest full-time job in 1950 (unless the woman was self-employed), education, marital status, age, number of children less than 18 years of age, years living in the current area, and father's occupation and industry. Some of the contemporaneous variables probably did not change over the preceding decade, but some probably did.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…an important, and somewhat limiting, aspect of the Palmer Survey is that all persons were working full-time for at least one month during 1950.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…the March 1944 census data are used to infer the work histories of women who were not in the labor force during 1950.
323~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Occupation~…a retrospective variable specifying the occupation of work (if the woman was in the labor force) as of January 1940, December 1944, December 1949, and January 1951.

323~D1, D2~V23~Variable~Father's Industry~…variables pertaining to the individual as of January 1951 include father's industry.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…the original schedules, not all of which have been located, contain detailed work histories. Although many of the coded schedules include transcribed versions of these accounts, they are difficult to read, and only the coded portions have been used here.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~The central issue to address with these data is whether women who entered the labor force during World War II remained employed until 1950, therby becoming the main contributors to the vastly increased labor-force participation of married women across the decade. An alternative scenario is that many women employed during the war left the labor force at its conclusion and that much of the increase in employment between 1940 and 1950 came from a post-war movement of women into the labor force. Part of this issue, that concerning the work histories of women employed as of 1950, can be addressed with the Palmer Survey data; the remaining issues are answered with the 1944 census data.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~The central issue to address with these data is whether women who entered the labor force during World War II remained employed until 1950, therby becoming the main contributors to the vastly increased labor-force participation of married women across the decade. An alternative scenario is that many women employed during the war left the labor force at its conclusion and that much of the increase in employment between 1940 and 1950 came from a post-war movement of women into the labor force. Part of this issue, that concerning the work histories of women employed as of 1950, can be addressed with the Palmer Survey data; the remaining issues are answered with the 1944 census data.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…although the entire Palmer Survey includes 4,350 women, about 1,200 were married, white, and between 35 and 64 years old (and, of course, working) in 1950. OF these, fully 52% were also in the 1940 labor force (i.e., employed, unemployed, or in the armed forces in January 1940). That is, more than half of those working in 1950 had also worked prior to America's entry into World War II.
323~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Labor Force Participation Rate Trends From 1940-1950~…from January 1940 to December 1944, 7% of the eventual 1950 participants left the labor force temporarily but 22% of the eventual 1950 workers joined during the war years. Thus part of the decade's increased participation occurred from 1940 through 1944, the peak year of women's involvement in the wartime economy. However, an even greater increase occurred in the six years from December 1944 through 1950, which includes the demobilization period. Fully 26% of married women (35 to 64 years old) who were workers in 1950 were drawn into the labor force between December 1944 and 1950. The annual rate of entry for the five years from January 1940 to December 1944 is identical to that for the six years from December 1944 through 1950. These increases do not count the group in the labor force in 1940, out by 1944, and in again by 1950. Moreover, these findings are robust to using various criteria. 
323~D1, D2, D3~T6~Time Period~1944.0~…the peak year of women's involvement in the wartime economy.
323~D1, D2~V19~Variable~Age~…age and marital status are as of the survey enumeration date (January 1951), which for purposes of exposition is listed here as 1950.
323~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Marital Status~…age and marital status are as of the survey enumeration date (January 1951), which for purposes of exposition is listed here as 1950.
323~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rate~…working in a particular year means January 1940, December 1944, full-time during any month in 1950, or January 1951, for each of these respective years.
323~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rate~…one might expect a bias to result from using the criterion of working during any month in 1950 if women are noncontinuous participants over the year. That is, more women will be found in that group than in one comprising women participating during a particular month. However, there would only be a bias if the criterion altered the distribution of women by employment history.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…the Palmer Survey also includes labor-force status at the time of enumberation (in January 1951), and the results are very similar to those using the criterion of working during any month in 1950. If anything, the results using January 1951 strengthen the finding of persistence for women who worked since 194. However, note that, in this case, there is a bias against an increase during the December 1944 to January 1951 period. Because all women in the sample worked during some month in 1950, the group working in January 1951 cannot include any woman who entered for the first time in that month.
323~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Employment Trends From 1940-1950~…among white, married women who were employed full-time for one month in 1950 (or in the labor force during January 1951), more than half were employed in 1940. the war was associated with a large increase in eventual employment, but it was smaller than that occurring from 1944 to 1950, which was 33% of the eventual 1950 labor force. Fully 26% of the 1950 participants were never employed during 1940 to 1944.
323~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Work Experience Trends From 1940-1950~…more than 80% of the women employed in January 1940, December 1944, and December 1949 had worked 9 to 10 years during the 1940's decade (75%, just slightly less, of those who worked only in January 1940 and December 1949). Fully 72% were employed every month of the decade, one-half of whom stayed on the same job for all 10 years. Only 5% were employed fewer than six years.
323~D2~V13~Variable~Work Experience~…summary data on total months worked from January 1940 to December 1949, from the coded forms for the Palmer Survey, are given in Table 3.

323~V13~L17~Variable Value~10.0~…the month-equivalent to working exactly 10 years during the period spanning January 1940 to December 1949.
323~D1, D2~F4~Findings~1944 Entry and Work Experience From 1940-1950~…52% of those who entered the labor force by 1944 accumulated seven or more years of work experience over the decade. Only 12.5% had less than five years of work experience. The only reasonable inference to be drawn is that the majority of these women were continual participants from the time they entered the work force until 1950. Also consistent with this viewe is that the majority of those not employed in 1940 and 1944, yet who were working in 1949, had been employed for rather short durations during the 1940's. Almost 94% of this group had worked fewer than five years.
323~D2~F5~Findings~Palmer Sample and Work Expereince During 1940-1950~…among women who worked in 1965 and who were born between 1911 and 1915, 50% had been in the labor force for 79% of the years from 1951 to 1969. In the survey being considered here, 47% of those in the entire sample (thus, who were in the labor force in 1950; see Table 3) were employed for 80% of the years from 1940 to 1950.

323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…an analysis of labor-force turnover among women during World War II requires additional data (to the Palmer Survey data) concerning those not in the labor force in 1950. Such data are available from a special question asked in the March 1944 precursor to the CPS. At the request of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, the Bureau of the Census asked women in 1944 what they were doing during the week preceding Pearl Harbor, December 1-6, 1941. The Bureau of the Census chose December 1 through 6, 1941, because it was thought that women would remember what they were doing the week before Pearl Harbor better than any other week just prior to America's entry into World War II. The census data yield labor-force transitions from December 1941 to March 1944, the first two sets of branches in the transition tree.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~"…the Palmer Survey contains information on the distribution of those ""in the labor force,"" that is, ""in"" during 1951. By distributing the total number of women known to have been in the labor force in 1951 according to the proportions in the Palmer Survey for the four ""in"" branches, one can easily obtain the entire transition tree."
323~D1~V24~Variable~Week Preceding Pearl Harbor~…at the request of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, the Bureau of the Census asked women in 1944 what they were doing during the week preceding Pearl Harbor, December 1-6, 1941.

"
323~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor-Force Transitions~…two transition trees are given in Table 4: one for married women 20-44 years old in 1944 and another for women of all marital statuses in this age group.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~"…the linkage of the census data with the Palmer Survey is not without possible biases, and they seem more severe for married women. The Palmer Survey listed a woman's marital status in January 1951 but not in any of the previous years. Young married women in 1951 were likely to have been unmarried in the early 1940's. Because the Women's Bureau data for 1944 are given only for women 20-44 years old and those older, one cannot use older age groups to get around the problem. The only solution is to use the Palmer data for women in a slightly older group: 30-51 years old, rather than 27-51 years old, in 1951. The same problem does not afflict the data for the all-marital-statuses category. In the absence of mortality and immigration, these women form a closed population, and their marital status in any particular year is of no consequence. Other possible biases may stem from the fact that the women in the Palmer Survey were all residents of large cities, while the data in the census are a national sample. This bias would matter only if the distribution among the four ""in"" branches in 1951 differed by urbanization level."

323~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor-Force Transitions~…the primary reason for constructing the tree diagrams in Table 4 is to compute the percentage of women drawn into the labor force during World War II who remained employed until 1951.
323~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Percentage Drawn into the Labor Force~…the primary reason for constructing the tree diagrams in Table 4 is to compute the percentage of women drawn into the labor force during World War II who remained employed until 1951.
323~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Married Women, Employment During 1941-1944, and January 1951~…the data for married women indicate that more than 85% of the women employed in December 1941 and March 1944 were similarly engaged in January 1951. The data, once again, reinforce the findings of other studies that show a tendency for women to remain in the labor force.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…the only document that has more detailed data on the labor-force participation of women in 1944 is Current Population Reports, Series P-50, Number 39 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1952). The Bureau released these data in 1951, using its more usual age categories (20-24, 25-34, 35-44, and 45-64 years), when it was reported that the proportion of married women in the labor force had exceeded the peak achieved during World War II. However, these figures were not published along with the information on what the women were doing in the week preceding Pearl Harbor.
323~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor-Force Transitions~…all numbers in parentheses are in thousands and are the actual numbers of women in the age-and-marital-status group in or out of the labor force (U.S. Department of Labor, 1944). Women who died or emigrated between 1941 and 1944 cannot be included. 
323~D3~D3~Dataset~U.S. Department of Labor~The data for December 1941 and March 1944 are from U.S. Department of Labor (1944), which in turn uses data from the CPS.

323~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor-Force Transitions~"The Palmer Survey gives only the number of women in the ""in"" branches for January 1951. The actual total number in all the branches in 1951 is derived by multiplying the total number of women in the population by the aggregate labor-force participation rate (e.g., 34.5% for all women in 1951). A blow-up factor is then computed by dividing this total number by the Palmer total, to obtain consistency with the national data for December 1941 and 1944. The Palmer numbers for each of the branches are then multiplied by the blow-up factor, and the resulting numbers are in parentheses in the January 1951 columns."
323~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~Blow-Up Factor~…a blow-up factor is computed by dividing the total number of womenin all the branches in 1951 by the Palmer total, to obtain consistency with the national data for December 1941 and 1944. 
323~D2~F7~Findings~Palmer Survey In-In-In Branch, Blow Up Factor, and the Adjusted Figure~"…the Palmer survey number for the in-in-in branch in 1951 for all women is 1,410, and the aggregate number of women in the labor force in this age group is 2,873 in the Palmer Survey. The total number of women actually in the labor force is 0.345*26,776 = 9,238(*1000). Dividing this number by the Palmer figure gives the blow-up factor of 3.215. The original number 1,410 times 3.215 equals 4,534, which is the datum listed in the first line for ""all marital statuses."""
323~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor-Force Transitions~"…the compution of the 1951 figures is equivalent to the following in algebraic terms. Considering the in-in-in branch, the question asked is: what is the probability of being in the labor force in 1951, conditional on being in the labor force in 1941 and 1944? That is Pr(L(51) = 1 | L(44) = 1 and L(41) = 1) = {Pr(L(51) = 1 and L(41) = 1 and L(44) = 1)}/Pr(L(44) = 1 and L(41) = 1) = {Pr(L(44) = 1 and L(41) = 1|L(51) = 1) *Pr(L(51) = 1)}/Pr(L(44) = 1 and L(41) = 1) by Bayes' Theorem, where L(t) is labor-force status in year t (1 is in the labor force, and 0 is out of the labor force). Pr(L(44) = 1 and L(41) = 1) comes from the Palmer Survey, Pr(L(51) = 1) is the labor-force participation rate, and Pr(L(44) = 1 and L(41) = 1) is from the CPS data. The same algebra can be manipulated for each of the ""in"" branches for 1951 in the table. The ""out"" branches for 1951 are derived by simple subtraction of the percentages for the ""in"" branches from 1."
323~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rate~The labor-force participation rate at the bottom of Table 4 is for the 27-51-year-old group, but only 30-51 year olds are used to derive the branches for married women in January 1951.
323~D1, D2~V18~Variable~Marital Status~The Palmer data include marital status as of January 1951, and many women who were younger than 30 years old in 1951 were not married in December 1941 and, therefore, should not be connected to them in the transition tree.
323~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Total Transition Rates, Adjusted Transition Rates and Blow-Up Factors Across Sources~"…the figures of 20.9% and 25.2% for December 1941 and March 1944 are from CPS data (U.S. Department of Labor, 1944) and include ""married spouse present"" and ""married spouse absent in armed Forces"" (but not ""married spouse absent, not in Armed Forces""). The increase between 1940 and 1944 was even greater. The figure of 25.5% for 1951 is obtained from one of 24.0% from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1953), for women of all races, and an inflation factor of 1.07 is used to correct decennial census figures for consistency with the CPS. The blow-up factor of 1.07 is derived from a comparison of the census data for 1950 with that from the CPS (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1951).  The corresponding blow-up factor for the ""all marital statuses"" group is 1.04, also derived from a comparison of census data with that from the CPS for 1950."
323~D1, D2~F9~Findings~Attrition of Employed Married Women and Pearl Harbor~…there was a substantial attrition of employed married women (i.e., married by 1944) from 1941 to 1944, when 34% of women employed just before the war exited. The decreased employment among this group deserves further comment. Because the census data include young women and give marital status in 1944, not 1941, many of these women may have married just following Pearl Harbor. Others, married before Pearl Harbor, may have become pregnant to enable their husbands to obtain draft deferments. The reasoning accords well with the finding also in Table 4, that women of all marital status who were 20-44 years old in 1944, had a persistence rate of more than 80% from 1941 to 1944. The war years, however, do appear peculiar with regard to the persistence of women workers.
323~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Bureau of the Census~…because the census data include young women and give marital status in 1944, not 1941, many of these women may have married just following Pearl Harbor. Others, married before Pearl Harbor, may have become pregnant to enable their husbands to obtain draft deferments.
323~D1, D2, D3~T7~Time Period~1942-1943~"…the years 1942 and 1943 did witness a ""baby boomlet,"" particularly for young women."
323~DV4~L18~Variable Value~Out-In~"…of great interest is how women working in 1944, but out of the labor force on the eve of World War II, responded at the war's conclusion. These may be called the ""Rosies"" of the war effort and are contained in the ""out-in"" branch, from 1941 to 1944. "
323~D1, D2~F10~Findings~Rosie the Riveter and Comparable Female Trends From 1940-1950~"…in 1944, ""Rosies"" contained 45% of married women workers 20-44 years old (but 34% of all women workers 20-44 years old). Part of the reason why the new entrants were such a large proportion of all working married women is that a large fraction left the labor force after Pearl Harbor. Of these wartime entrants, only 46% of the married women remained employed until January 1951 (65% of women of all marital statuses did). The ""Rosies"" of 1944 were 20% of the eventual 1951 employment among married women, but at that time, they were less than half their original number. Rosie and her compatriots did not remain in the postwar labor force tot he degree entrants had in normal times. The figure for persistence among the Rosies increases to about 55% when the 1950 (rather than the January 1951) data are used and to 48% when the data for December 1949 are used. The result that about half the Rosies left the labor force sometime after the war seems robust to the choice of end points among the three available."
323~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Wartime Entrants and Labor Force Participation in 1951~…the data in Table 4 indicate that about 50% of the wartime entrants exited the labor force by 1951. Aspects of the exodus are well known. Many women were forced out of high-paying jobs in traditionally male industries, such as aircraft and machinery, through seniority systems that favored returning servicement (Milkman, 1987). However, the relative magnitudes of those who remained in the labor force and those who exited had previously not been known. Women employed in wartime industries could not have been pushed out at the war's conclusion but reemployed in other sectors.
323~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Labor-Force Participation for Married Woman With and Without Husbands in the Armed Forces~…labor-force participation among women whose husbands were in the armed forces and away from home greatly exceeded that among women whose husbands were at home in 1944. For married women 25-44 years old, for example, the figures are 55.0% for those with husbands in the Armed Forces and 24.7% for those whose husbands were not. Increased participation, therefore, was not just a function of the demands of the wartime economy; it was also a product of the draft.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~The Palmer Survey reveals that women employed in 1940 and during any other year in the 1940's, were considerably different from those who entered during the 1940's but were not in the labor force in 1940.
323~D1, D2~F13~Findings~Employment Across 1940-1950, Education, and Number of Children Less than 18~…those employed in 1940 were more educated and had far fewer children than those who were not in the labor force in 1940 but entered at some subsequent date. As Table 5 indicate, there is almost a nine-month difference in education between those who were employed in 1940 and those who were not; twice as many had attended college and one third more had graduated from high school. When considering the younger group in comparing the number of children, the differences here are even greater. Among those younger than 45 years old in 1950, the mean number of children under 18 years old was 1.77 for those in the labor force in 1950 but not working in 1940 and 1944; it was only 0.50 for those in the labor force in 1940 and 1944. The largest differences are found in the proportion of women who chad no children younger than 18 years old in 1950. The group who were 35-54 years old in 1950  would have been 25-44 years old in 1940, when the children covered by the question would have been less than 8 years old. Fully three-quarters of the women in the labor force in 1940 and in the labor force at any of the subsequent dates had no childen in this age group; but one-third of the women who were not in the labor force in 1940 and 1944 did.
323~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Number of Children Less than 18~Because many of the women's children were older than 18 years by 1950, and thus not included in the survey's question, it is useful to consider only the younger group in comparing the number of children.

323~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Occupational Distributions and Human Capital~Women who were not in the labor force in 1940 had rather similar occupational distributions when employed in either 1944 or 1950. Similarly, women employed in 1940 and during any of the subsequent years given also had comparable occupation distributions across the 1940's. However, the difference between the two groups - those employed in 1940 and those not - is substantial. For those employed in 1940, the percentage in the professional and managerial class is almost twice that for those who were not employed in 1940. The human capital of these two groups, not the demands of the economy, seems to have been vital in their occupational (although perhaps not their industrial) choices.
323~D2~F15~Findings~Educational Attainment, Trends from 1940-1950~The Palmer data show that educational attainment among all women 35-44 years old (in 1950) in the labor force falls sharply from 1940 to 1949, then rises slightly from 1949 to 1950. Among those in the labor force in 1940, when the cohort was 30 years old, mean schooling was 10.86 years. In 1944, when the cohort was 34 years old, the mean schooling level was 10.49; by 1949, it was 10.29; and in 1950, it was 10.34. Notethat particpants include only those in the Palmer Survey and, therefore, only those employed full-time for at least one month in 1950.
323~V3~L27~Variable Value~Professional and Semiprofessional~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V3~L28~Variable Value~Managerial and Proprietrary~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V3~L29~Variable Value~Clerical~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V3~L30~Variable Value~Sales~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V33~L31~Variable Value~Operative, Craft, and Laborer~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V3~L32~Variable Value~Domestic~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V3~L33~Variable Value~Other Service~…one of seven occupational groups of interest in the current research.
323~V3~L31~Variable Value~Operative, Craft, and Laborer~Farm-sector employment is included in the operative-laborer category.
323~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Persistence Rates~Persisters are women who remained in the same occupational category between 1941 and 1944 or between 1944 and 1949.
323~D3~D3~Dataset~U.S. Department of Labor~…information for columns 3, 4, and 5 of Table 6 comes from the census data for which there is information about 1941 and 1944. Therefore, column 4 gives information for those women employed in 1944 who could have been in or out of the labor force in 1941.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~…columns 2, 6 and 7 refer to the Palmer Survey data. Column 6, for example, gives the occupational distribution of women employed in 1944 and 1950 who could have been in or out of the labor force in 1940.
323~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Occupational Distributions~…occupational distributions for 1944 and the persistence women demonstrated in them are given in Table 6. 
323~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Occupational Group and Persistence~…women remained employed in a particular occupational group from year to year even during the somewhat turbulent 1940's. More than 90% of women in operative positions in 1941 remained in them until 1944. Among the least persistent, not surprisingly, were those in the operative group in 1944 who were employed in 1949 and 1950 as well. The divergent findings regarding industrial jobs during and after the war are to be expected. It is the persistence across the spectrum of occupations that is surprising. Among all women employed in 1940, few, it seems, altered their occupations during and after the war. Of those employed in both 1941 and 1944, only 15% changed their major occupational group; and of those employed in 1944 and 1949, only 14.5% did. 
323~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Occupational Distribution Differences~…large differences in occupations existed between women who entered in 1944 and who were employed in 1940 or 1941. New entrants (column 3 in Table 6) were far less likely to be in professional and managerial groups and were more likely to be in the operative and service groups than those previously employed. Rosie the Riveter and her fellow workers are apparent in the 37% who were operatives in 1944 among those not in the labor force in 1941, a figure that is nearly 10 percentage points higher than that for women who were also in the labor force in 1940 and 1950 (column 7).
323~D1, D2~F18~Findings~Occupational Distribution by Entrant Classification~…it is likely that 67% of the Rosies who exited at the war's conclusion were operatives and service-sector workers in 1944, a figure substantially higher than that for other groups. Among all new entrants, the figure was 55%; and among those who remained employed until 1950, it was 47%.
323~D1, D2~F19~Findings~Persistence during 1940-1950 and War-Related Industries~Fully one-sixth of the working women in 1944 were in a war-related industry (e.g., fabricated metals, airplane assembly, rubber, chemicals). Even in the Palmer Survey, which includes only those in the labor force in 1950, one in 6.26% ot 16% were in these industries. One-third of the Palmer Survey women in these industries, however, were not operatives and craft workers, but were in clerical positions. Of those in war-related industries in 1944 and also in the labor force in 1950, 45% remained in war-related industries to 1950, and 66% were in the manufacturing sector in general, indicating considerable persistence even in the war-related sector.
323~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~Even though the increase in employment among those working in 1950 was greater after World War II, one may still wonder whether wartime employment enhanced women's marketable skills. One way of testing this hypothesis, and also of evaluating the determinants of earnings during the 1940's, is to estimate a standard earnings function that includes variables capturing wartime labor-force status. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 7 contain such regressions.
323~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~The functions estimated are similar to those in other studies of earnings. The dependent variable is the log of weekly earnings for the longest full-time job in 1950, although it seems clear from the unexplained variance of earnings that hours must have differed greatly among workers. The somewhat low R-squared values are likely to be the result of this excluded variable. The sample for the column-1 estimates includes all white, married women in the Palmer Survey who meet the age criterion.
323~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Weekly Earnings at the Longest Full-Time Job in 1950~…the dependent variable in log wage regressions is the log of weekly earnings for the longest full-time job in 1950.
323~D1, D2~F20~Findings~Earnings Premiums, Education, Work Experience, and Geographic Area~…work experience across the 1940's decade increased earnings by 3.5% for each year, and schooling increased earnings by 2.3%, again for each year. High school graduation and college attendance added little extra. Continuity in a particular geographic area had benefits; moving away from a residence of 25-years duration meant that a woman forfeited 7% of her income.
323~D1, D2~V27~Variable~Labor Force Entry During 1940 and 1944~…of particular interest for this study is the variable indicating whether a woman entered the labor force between 1940 and 1944 and its interaction with age.
323~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Labor Force Entry During 1940 and 1944, Age~…of particular interest for this study is the variable indicating whether a woman entered the labor force between 1940 and 1944 and its interaction with age.
323~D1, D2~F21~Findings~Wartime and Post-Wartime Premiums Across Age Groups~…earnings for the wartime entrants were higher (although the difference is not statistically significant) for those under 45 years old (0.260/0.00577) but lower for those over 45 years old. According to these coefficients, a 29-year-old women (born in 1915) who began employment between 1940 and 1944 earned a 9% premium for the rest of her working life, relative to a comparable individual who entered prior to 1940. Note that there is nothing unusual about the war. An even larger premium exists for women younger than 43 years of age (0.626/0.0145) who entered the labort force between 1944 and 1949. A 32-year-old woman (again, one born in 1915) who entered the labor force in 1947 earned a 16% premium in comparison with a woman who entered prior to 1940 and a 7% premium in comparison with the woman above who entered in 1944. Even though one of these women has three more years of job experience, the earnings difference is only 3.6%. These results suggest a vintage effect in new hirings. They also suggest that women over age 45 were less able to adapt to new technologies or were discrminated against at the time of hiring.
323~D1, D2~V28~Variable~Region~…regional dummies are included in the log wage regressions excluding East to avoid collinearity.
323~V28~L34~Variable Value~West~…regional dummies for West include both Los Angeles and San Francisco.
323~V28~L35~Variable Value~Midwest~…regional dummies for Midwest include both Chicago and St. Paul
323~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Occupation~…in log-wage regression, occupations are in divided into five groups.
323~V3, DV11~L19~Variable Value~Professional~…one of five occupational groups specified in log wage regressions.
323~V3, DV11~L20~Variable Value~Managerial~…one of five occupational groups specified in log wage regressions.
323~V3, DV11~L21~Variable Value~Clerical and Sales~…one of five occupational groups specified in log wage regressions.
323~V3, DV11~L22~Variable Value~Operative and Craft~…one of five occupational groups specified in log wage regressions.
323~V3, DV11~L23~Variable Value~Domestic Service~…one of five occupational groups specified in log wage regressions.
323~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the regression of column 2 contains a variable indicating whether the woman had the same occupation in 1940 and 1950. The sample, therefore, includes only (white, married) women employed in 1940.
323~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Persistence Premiums~…there was a 9% premium for remaining in the same occupational group in both years, which is evidence that continuity in an occupation, not just wartime work, enhanced a woman's earning ability. Being in a war-related industry in 1944 did not affect earnings and is not included in the results.
323~D2~F23~Findings~Primary Palmer Survey Conclusions~…the primary conclusion from the Palmer Survey data is that more than 50% of the women working in 1950 had been employed in 1950 and that the rate of entrance into the labor force, among those employed in 1950, was the same during the first half of the 1940's (the war period) as during the second half. Just 20% of those working in 1950 had entered the labor force during World War II, and about half the wartime entrants left the labor force sometime after December 1944.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~The Palmer Survey has offered a unique view of the female labor force in World War II but does not enable a direct test of the hypothesis concerning a chnaged ideology. The Palmer Survey data have reinforced the conclusions of a growing literature that wartime work did not by itself greatly increase women's employment.
323~D2~D2~Dataset~Palmer Survey~The Palmer Survey (see Palmer, 1954) is a population-based sample of workers from six cities (Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New Haven, Philadelphia, and San Francisco) collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census to explore labor mobility in the 1940's. It is currently aviable fromt he author as an ASCII or a STATA file and will be eventually archived at ICPSR. The data set contains retrospective work histories, from 1940 to 1950, for 4,350 women who worked full-time at least one month in 1950. The work histories are in summary form, containing information on the employment status, industry, and occupation of the individual in 1940, 1944, 1949, 1950, and 1951 and at the time of her first job. Also included are age, marital status, race, years in area, children under 18 years old, place of birth, relationship to household head, education, and father's occupation and industry.
327~327: The Supply of Child Care Labor~~~~
327~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
327~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…in this article, the researcher estimates a model of the child care labor market. The model yields estimates of the elasticity of supply of child care labor and other labor and of the impact of a variety of child care subsidies and other government interventions in the child care market on the hours of work and wages of child care workers and other workers. The main reason for modeling the child care labor market instead of the child care market itself is availability of information.
327~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…in this article, the researcher estimates a model of the child care labor market. The model yields estimates of the elasticity of supply of child care labor and other labor and of the impact of a variety of child care subsidies and other government interventions in the child care market on the hours of work and wages of child care workers and other workers. The main reason for modeling the child care labor market instead of the child care market itself is availability of information.
327~D1~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in this article, the researcher estimates a model of the child care labor market. The model yields estimates of the elasticity of supply of child care labor and other labor and of the impact of a variety of child care subsidies and other government interventions in the child care market on the hours of work and wages of child care workers and other workers. The main reason for modeling the child care labor market instead of the child care market itself is availability of information.
327~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Child Care Labor Supply~…since child care is a relatively labor-intensive activity, the elasticity of child care labor supply should provide a good indication of the elasticity of child care supply.
327~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Child Care Labor Supply~…the model presented is consistent in theory with a broad range of possible values of the elasticity of child care labor supply and the resulting incidence of child care subsidies. 
327~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Perfect Elasticity~...at one extreme, subsidies to both consumers and providers benefit consumers only; that is, the supply of child care (or child care labor) is perfectly elastict. This scenario, although extreme, is not implausible. Child care is one of the easiest occupations to enter; reguations concerning qualifications of child care workers at the state level are typically minimal, and in states with tougher standards, the majority of child care is usually unlicensed, that is, avoids the regulations.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the current empirical analysis uses a time series of 11 random cross-section samples of female child care workers, other female workers, and female nonworkers from the March Current Population surveys (CPS). The researcher merged onto this data set information on state and federal child care subsidy parameters and regulations.
327~D1~V1~Variable~Sector~…the model of empirical estimation of the elasticity of supply of child care labor is based on the assumption that a woman chooses among three mutually exclusive alternatives. This formulation is restrictive in some respects and is clearly not the only possible approach to modeling child care labor supply, but it yields a simple and easily interpretable empirical model.
327~V1~L2~Variable Value~Not Participation in the Labor Force~…one of three mutually exclusive alternatives indicating that a woman has chosen not to participate in the labor force.
327~V1~L3~Variable Value~Child Care~…one of three mutually exclusive alternatives indicating that a woman is working as a child care provider and simultaneous caring for her own young children, if any.
327~V1~L4~Variable Value~Other~…one of three mutually exclusive alternatives indicating that a woman is working in some other occupation (than child care) and purchasing care for her children, if any, in the child care market.
327~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Quality of Child Care~…the model allows for endogenous choice of child care quality by purchasers of child care.
327~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Skill Endowment~…the key assumptions are that the quality of labor in a given sector of the labor market varies along a single dimension and that labor markets are perfectly competitive in quality units.
327~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Wage Offer~…an individual's wage offer in a particular sector of the labor market is determined by her endowment of sector-specific quality or skill and the unit price of skill in that sector.
327~D1~V2~Variable~Unit Price of Skill~…the unit price of skill is used in determining an individual's wage offer in a particular sector of the labor market (in this case, the child care sector).
327~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Skill Endowment~…because the model is static, the skill or quality endowment is taken as given. 
327~D1~V2~Variable~Unit Price of Skill~…skill prices are exogenous to the individual but determined endogenously in general equilibrium by the supply of and demand for skill units in each sector.
327~D1~V1~Variable~Sector~…let (i) index the sector.
327~V1~L2~Variable Value~Not Participation in the Labor Force~…(i) = 1 represents nonparticipation in the labor force.
327~V1~L3~Variable Value~Child Care~…(i) = 2 represents the child care sector.
327~V1~L4~Variable Value~Other~…(i) = 3 represents an aggregate of all other sectors of the market, referred to as the other sector.
327~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Wage Offer~…the wage rate that woman j could earn in sector (i) is W(ij) = [pi](ij)t(ij) where [pi] is the skill price and t is the skill endowment. Equation (1).
327~D1~V2~Variable~Unit Price of Skill~…[pi] is the skill price. The skill price has a j subscript because the price of skill differs across markets if mobility is costly.
327~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Skill Endowment~…t is the skill endowment.
327~DV2~L5~Variable Value~Wage Offer 2~…the variable W(2j) should be interpreted as the wage rate for a child care worker per child cared for per hour.
327~D1~V1~Variable~Sector~…a woman chooses the sector that yields the highest utility.
327~D1~V4~Variable~Hours Worked~…a woman optimally chooses hours of work given the sector chosen.
327~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Direct Utility Function~…it is straightfoward to specify the direct utility function for this model and use it in combination with the budget constraint to derive the indirect utility function.
327~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~…it is straightfoward to specify the budget constraint for this model and use it in combination with the direct utility function to derive the indirect utility function.
327~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Indirect Utility Function~…it is straightfoward to specify the direct utility function and budget constraint for this model and use them to derive the indirect utility function.
327~DV5~L6~Variable Value~Indirect Utility Function 1~…the indirect utility function for nonparticipation in the labor force is a function of the marginal tax rate, exogeneous nonwage income, and a taste shifter. Equation (2).
327~DV5~L7~Variable Value~Indirect Utility Function 2~…the indirect utility function for participation in the child care sector is a function of the marginal tax rate, exogeneous nonwage income, a taste shifter, the skill endowment for child care, the marginal subsidy rate to child care providers, the minimum skill requirement for becoming a child care worker, the legal maximum child-staff ratio, the number of woman's own children requiring child care, the skill price for child care, and the fixed cost of working in sector 2. Equation (3).
327~DV5~L8~Variable Value~Indirect Utility Function 3~…the indirect utility function for participation in an occupation other than child care is a function of the marginal tax rate, exogenous nonwage income, a taste shifter, the skill endowment in sector 3, the marginal subsidy rate to child care consumers, the unit price of child care labor, the unit price of sector 3 labor, the fixed cost of working in sector 3, and the number of the woman's own children requiring child care. Equation (4).
327~D1~V6~Variable~Marginal Tax Rate~…T the marginal tax rate.
327~D1~V7~Variable~Exogenous Nonwage Income~…E is exogenous nonwage income.
327~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Tastes~…A is a taste shifter variable
327~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Marginal Subsidy Rate~…the marginal subsidy rate based on the sector of employment.
327~D1~V15~Variable~Minimum Skill Requirement~…R is the minimum skill requirement for becoming a child care worker.
327~D1~V5~Variable~Legal Maximum Child-Staff Ratio~…N-bar is the legal maximum child-staff ratio.
327~D1~V10~Variable~Number of Children by Age~…N is the number of the woman's own children requiring child care.
327~D1~V11~Variable~Fixed Cost of Sector-Specific Work~…C(i) is the fixed cost of working in sector (i).
327~V9~L9~Variable Value~To Child Care Providers~…s(2) is the marginal subsidy rate to child care providers.
327~V9~L10~Variable Value~To Child Care Consumers~…s(3) is the marginal subsidy rate to child care consumers.
327~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Direct Utility Function~...let the utility function be U(G, Q), where G is a composite purchased good, and Q is the quality of child care. 
327~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Quality of Child Care~…Q is the quality of child care. Quality Q is produced with inputs of the mother's time at home, H(1); purchased child care time, H(3); and the time she spends caring for her children while providing care for paying children, H(2). Each time input is weighted by its quality, with the quality of the mother's home time normalized to one: Q = Q(H(1), H(2)t(2), H(3)t^D), where t^D is the endogenous quality of care purchased if the mother is an other-sector worker.
327~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Hours Worked~…child care quality is produced with various measures of time inputs (hours worked in each sector).
327~DV8~L11~Variable Value~Time 1~…H(1) is the mother's time at home.
327~DV8~L12~Variable Value~Time 2~…H(2) is the time the mother spends caring for her children while providing care for paying children.
327~DV8~L13~Variable Value~Time 3~…H(3) is the purchased child are time, which is equal to the number of hours she works in the other sector.
327~DV6~L14~Variable Value~Endogenous Quality~…t^D represents the endogenous quality of care purchased if the mother is an other-sector worker.
327~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Time Constraint~…the time constraint is H(1) + H(2) + H(3) = 1, and because it is assumed that a woman can be employed in one sector at most, H(2)H(3) = 0. 
327~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Time~…the time constraint is H(1) + H(2) + H(3) = 1, and because it is assumed that a woman can be employed in one sector at most, H(2)H(3) = 0. 
327~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~…the budget constraint depends on the sector chosen.
327~DV4~L15~Variable Value~Budget Constraint 1~…for nonparticipants, the budget constraint is (1 - T)E = G.
327~DV4~L16~Variable Value~Budget Constraint 2~…for child care workers, the budget constraint is (1-T)[E + (1 + s(2))W(2)H(2)(N-bar - N)] = G + C(2)R, where it is assumed that child care workers care for the legal maximum number of children, net of their own children requiring care, and that C(2), the fixed cost of becoming a child care worker, depends positively on the minimum skill requirement imposed by government regulation.
327~D1~V10~Variable~Number of Children by Age~…it is assumed that child care workers care for the legal maximum number of children, net of their own children requiring care.
327~V11~L17~Variable Value~Fixed Cost 2~…it is assumed that the fixed cost of becoming a child care worker, depends positively on the minimum skill requirement imposed by government regulation.
327~DV4~L18~Variable Value~Budget Constraint 3~…the budget constraint for an other-sector worker is (1 - T)(E + H(3)W(3)) = G + C(3) + (1 - s(3))H(3)P^DN, where P^D is the endogenous demand price for an hour of child care per child, determined by P^D = [pi](2)t^D.
327~D1~V12~Variable~Demand Price~…the endogenous demand price for an hour of child care per child, determined by P^D = [pi](2)t^D.
327~D1~V1~Variable~Sector~…the woman's optimization problem is to choose the sector that yields maximum utility and to choose optimally the values of choice variables in the sector chosen, given the sector-specific time and budget constraints.
327~DV8~L12~Variable Value~Time 2~…the choice variable in sector 2 is H(2).
327~DV8~L13~Variable Value~Time 3~…one of the two choice variables in sector 3 is H(3).
327~DV6~L14~Variable Value~Endogenous Quality~…the endogenous quality of child care labor is one of the two choice variables in sector 3.
327~DV5~L7~Variable Value~Indirect Utility Function 2~…in equation (3), subsidies and regulations affect utility as a child care worker because they enter the budget constraint. Subsidies and regulations influence utility indirectly because in general equilibrium they affect the skill price for sector 2 and 3 labor.
327~D1~V2~Variable~Unit Price of Skill~…subsidies and regulations influence utility indirectly because in general equilibrium they affect the skill price for sector 2 and 3 labor.
327~DV2~L5~Variable Value~Wage Offer 2~…the variable N influences the gross hourly wage rate for a child care worker by determining the number of children cared for per hour.
327~D1~V10~Variable~Number of Children by Age~…the variable N influences the gross hourly wage rate for a child care worker by determining the number of children cared for per hour.
327~V2~L19~Variable Value~Skill Price 2~…in equation (4), [pi](2) represents the cost of child care per hour per unit of quality for women who work in the other sector and must purchase market care.
327~DV5~L8~Variable Value~Indirect Utility Function 3~…in equation (4), [pi](2) represents the cost of child care per hour per unit of quality for women who work in the other sector and must purchase market care.
327~V1~L3~Variable Value~Child Care~…increasing subsidies to child care providers and loosening regulations on providers make the child care sector more attractive.
327~V1~L4~Variable Value~Other~…increasing consumer subsidies makes working in the other sector and paying for child care more attractive. 
327~V2~L19~Variable Value~Skill Price 2~…an increase in the cost of child care makes paying for child care while working in the other sector less attractive.
327~V1~L4~Variable Value~Other~…an increase in the cost of child care makes paying for child care while working in the other sector less attractive.
327~D1~V13~Variable~Fertility~…in alternative specifications of the model, fertility is allowed to be endogenous.
327~D1~V14~Variable~Leisure~…in alternative specificaitons of the model, leisure is allowed to enter the utility functiona and fertility to be endogenous.
327~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…alternative specifications of the model include allowing for leisure to enter the utility function and fertility to be endogenous. Incorporating informal child care at no direct cost changes the number of sectors in the model but leaves the predictions unchanged for those sectors in which the woman is a paid child care worker or pays for child care.
327~D1~V1~Variable~Sector~…incorporating informal child care at no direct cost changes the number of sectors in the model but leaves the predictions unchanged for those sectors in which the woman is a paid child care worker or pays for child care.
327~D1~V4~Variable~Hours Worked~…conditional on the choice of sector, the equations for hours of work in sectors 2 and 3 (H(2) and H(3)) have the same arguments as equations (3) and (4), respectively.
327~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…alternative specifications of the model include allowing for leisure to enter the utility function and fertility to be endogenous. Incorporating informal child care at no direct cost changes the number of sectors in the model but leaves the predictions unchanged for those sectors in which the woman is a paid child care worker or pays for child care.
327~D1~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…alternative specifications of the model include allowing for leisure to enter the utility function and fertility to be endogenous. Incorporating informal child care at no direct cost changes the number of sectors in the model but leaves the predictions unchanged for those sectors in which the woman is a paid child care worker or pays for child care.
327~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…this model is used to estimate the effect of changes in labor supply and demand determinants in each sector on the sector-specific unit skill price with the dependent variable set as the natural logarithm of the sector-specific unit skill price and with an explanatory variable set as a vector of aggregate determinants of the supply of and demand for labor in each sector. y(i) is a coefficient vector and the error term accounts for disturbances in the estimates. It is assumed that the indirect utility functions and the log of hours of work are linear in log([pi](2)) and log([pi](3)]). Equation (5).
327~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…this model is used to estimate the effect of changes in individual determinants of skills and tastes on the skill endowment by sector with the dependent variable set as the natural log of t(i) and with explanatory variables set as a vector of individual determinants of skills and tastes. [beta](i) is a coefficient vector and the error term accounts for disturbances in the estimates. The author also assumes that the indirect utility functions and the log of hours of work are linear in the levels of this argument. Equation (6).
327~D1~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…this model is used to estimate the effect of changes in individual determinants of skills and tastes on the taste shifter variable with the verbatim taste shifter variable set as the dependent variable and the vector of individual determinants set as the explanatory variable. A coefficient vector and disturbance term are also added to the model. The author assumes that the indirect utility functions and the log of hours of work are linear in the levels of this argument. Equation (7).
327~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~"…the estimation method consists of three steps. First, equations (5) - (7) are substituted into (2)-(4), yielding reduced-form index functions for utility. The reduced-form choice of sector model is estimated by multinomial logit, with the explanatory variable including Z, X, and E. SEcond, taking the logarithm of the wage and substituting equations (5) and (6) into (1) yield sector-specific log wage equations. These are estimated by least squares, with sectoral self-selection corrected using the logit results and the ""transformation to normality"" approach of Lee (1983). The explanatory variables in the wage equations include Z and X. Exclusion of E (exogenous income) from the wage equations identifies the selection correction term. Third, the estimates of y(i) are used to compute estimates of log([pi](2)) and log([pi](3)) facing each woman. These estimated log skill prices are included in equations (2)-(4), and this structural choice of sector model is estimated by logit. The structural log hours of work equations are estimated by least squares, correcting for selectivity in a manner similar to the method used for the wage equations. These structural equations include log([pi](2)), log([pi](3)), X, E, and subsidies and regulations but exclude Z since Z is assumed to affect labor supply only through its effects on [pi](2) and [pi](3)."

The estimated elasticities of sector choice, and hours conditional on choice of sector, with respect to [pi](2) can be combined to estimate the overall elasticity of child care labor supply. The model has a number of exclusion and sign restrictions that can be tested easily. This is important because the model excludes some important aspects of child care.

327~V1~L20~Variable Value~Informal Child Care~"…many children are cared for in ""nonmarket"" arrangements by relatives or friends at no direct monetary cost. This feature of child care could be incorporated in the model, but the data described in the next section do not contain the information needed to estimate such a model. Excluding informal child care makes it important to test the validity of the restrictions implied by the model."
327~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Quality of Child Care~…an important restriction is that the quality of child care is allowed to vary along only one dimension. Excuding multidimensional quality makes it important to test the validity of the restrictions implied by the model.
327~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Child Care Labor Supply~…the estimated elasticities of sector choice, and hours conditional on choice of sector, with respect to [pi](2) can be comibined to estimate the overall elasticity of child care labor supply. This parameter could be estimated more efficiently by using a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimator, but at the cost of much greater compuational complexity.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the main data source for this study is the March CPS Public Use Tapes for 1977-87. The CPS data on individuals are supplemented with aggregate data from a variety of sources described below. From the March CPS tapes, a sample was drawn consisting of all female child care workers between teh ages of 18 and 64 (inclusive) and a random subsample of all other women in the same age range. At most, one woman from a given household was included in the sample. the sample begins with the March 1977 survey because in prior years it is not possible to identify the state of residence of all individuals in the sample, and this information is needed in order to determine the subsidies and regulations to which each woman is subject. Males were excluded fromt he sample because over 95% of child care workers are female.
327~D1~V16~Variable~States~…states are assumed to be the relevant markets in this model.
327~D1~T1~Time Period~1977-87~…the main data source for this study is the March CPS Public Use Tapes for 1977-87. The sample begins with the March 1977 survey because in prior years it is not possible to identify the state of residence of all individuals in the sample, and this information is needed in order to determine the subsidies and regulations to which each woman is subject.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample consists of 4,305 child care workers, 7,180 other workers, and 3,710 nonworkers.
327~V1~L4~Variable Value~Other~…other workers are women who worked at least 1 hour in 1 week during the calendar year prior to the March survey in which they were included.
327~V1~L2~Variable Value~Not Participation in the Labor Force~…nonworkers did not work at all in the previous calendar year.
327~V1~L3~Variable Value~Child Care~…child care workers worked at least 1 hour during the previous calendar year prior to the March survey in which they were included.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the occupationa and industry codes used to classify the sample are for the longest job worked during the previous calendar year.

327~D1~V18~Variable~Industry~…the industry codes used to classify the sample are for the longest job worked during the previous calendar year.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…determining who is a child care worker in the CPS data requires considerable care. The sample of child workers is quite heterogeneous, as it includes both casual babysitters and highly educated preschool teachers.
327~V1~L3~Variable Value~Child Care~…determining who is a child care worker in the CPS data requires considerable care. The sample of child workers is quite heterogeneous, as it includes both casual babysitters and highly educated preschool teachers.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…as a result of the scheme used to draw the sample for this study, the sample is ""choice based"". That is, the proportion of child care workers in the sample does not equal their proportion in the population, even in the limit. This aspect of the sample desing does not affect estimation of the wage and hours equations but does have implications for estimation of the probability that a woman chooses to become a child care worker. The actual proportion who report that they are child care workers is about 1%."
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a feature of the sample worth noting is that some child care workers appear in the sample twice because of the CPS sampling scheme, which includes half the households in a given March survey in the March survey of the following year. This does not affect interpretation of the parameter estimates but could cause the standard error estimates to be inconsistent.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…because many home-based child care workers are unlicensed and may wish to avoid detection, it is likely that the CPS, undercounts such workers. If the decision to report child care earnings is uncorrelated with the disturbances in the model, then this will not affect the estimates.
327~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Average Hourly Rate~…the average hourly rate is equal to annual earnings divided by weeks worked all multiplied by usual weekly hours.
327~D1~F1~Findings~Child Care Workers vs. Other Workers~…the average hourly wage rate of child care workers is only half that of other workers. Also, child care workers on average work 11 fewer weeks per year and 6 fewer hours per week than other workers. As a result, child care workers' average annual earnings are less than one-third the average earnings of other workers. Another important difference is that child are workers average .45 children of preschool age compared to .26 for other workers. In this respect child care workers are very similar to nonworkers, although in other dimensions such as age and education child care workers have a closer resemblance to other workers than to nonworkers.
327~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Tastes~…the variables assumed to determine tastes include age, race, education, residence, in a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA), number of children by age, marital status, and household structure.

327~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Individual Determinants~…the variables assumed to determine skill endowment (the X vector) include age, race, education, residence, in a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA), number of children by age, marital status, and household structure. Some of these variables are not traditionally thought of as skill or human capital determinants, but they may be proxies for unobserved components of skill, particularly in the child care sector.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…there were no plausible exclusion restrictions, given the limited number of relevant variables available in the CPS, that would allow identification fot he separate effects of individual variables on the skills and preferences.

327~D1~V7~Variable~Exogenous Nonwage Income~…exogenous income (E) is measured by the husband's earnings (if a husband is present) under the assumption that marital status and the husband's labor supply are both exogenous and by other nonwork-conditional sources of family income.
327~D1~V19~Variable~Age~…the age of the CPS respondent as included in a vector of individual determinants.

327~DV14~L21~Variable Value~Marginal Subsidy Rate 3~…the main sources of government subsidies to child care consumers are federal and state child care expense tax credits and deductions.
327~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Maximum Child Care Tax Credit~…for each woman in the sample, a combined federal and state maximum dollar amount for the child care tax credit (MAXCRED) was computed using the appropriate federal and state tax schedules for 1976-86.
327~D1~V6~Derived Variable~Marginal Tax Rate~…for each woman in the sample, a combined federal, state, and payroll marginal tax rate (T) was computed using the appropriate federal and state tax schedules for 1976-86.
327~Dv14~L21~Variable Value~Marginal Subsidy Rate 3~…for each woman in the sample, a combined federal and state marginal child care tax credit subsidy rate (s(3)) was computed using the appropriate federal and state tax schedules for 1976-86. 
327~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Maximum Child Care Tax Credit~…in order to avoid conditioning the calculations on endogenous variables such as hours of work, the policy variables were calculated under the assumption that each woman was married with two children under age 14 (the maximum age of eligibility for the child care tax credit) and had a family income equal to the real equivalent of $10,000 in 1979. Therefore the variation across women in these variables is due solely to variation across states and over time in the parameters of state and federal tax and child care credit schedules.

327~D1~F2~Findings~Average Subsidy Rate Under Child Care Tax Credit~…the average subsidy rate under the child care tax credit, using the assumptions underlying the model, is about .27. The average maximum tax credit available is $975. There is considerable variation in the tax credit subsidy rate over time and across states.
327~DV14~L22~Variable Value~Marginal Subsidy Rate 2~…child care providers are subsidized under a variety of federal programs, the most important of which are Head Start, the Child Care Food Program, and Title XX Social Service Block Grants. Under the Head Start and Child Care Food Program, funds are allocated to state based on population, so there is no variation across states in per capita funding under these programts. Therefore the author uses combined real total federal spending under these two programs as one indicator of producer subsidies. Under the Title XX program, each state is also allocated funds in proportion to a population but states have discretion over how much to spend on each of a variety of social services. In the case of child are each state is rquired to establish a rate at which providers will be reimbursed per eligible child in care. Eligibility is based on family income. The daily Title XX reimbursement rate for each state is used as another indicator of the subsidy rate for providers.
327~DV14~L22~Variable Value~Marginal Subsidy Rate 2~…in 1986 the daily Title XX reimbursement rate varied from $3.02 in the least generous state to $12.28 in the most generous state (in 1979 dollars). Real spending on Head Start varied between $555 million in 197 and $703 million in 1985, and Child Care Food Program funding varied between $109 million in 1976 and $280 million in 1986.
327~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Maximum Child Care Tax Credit~…federal and state tax schedules are of coures nonlinear, and in many cases the child care tax credit schedules are also nonlinear. The calculations described above are based on the assumption that a linear approximation to the tax shcedule and a two-point approximation the child care credit schedule will adequately capture the effects for incorporating the maximum tax credis is that even such a maximum in explicity or implicity part of every child care tax credit or deducation schedule.

327~DV14~L22~Variable Value~Marginal Subsidy Rate 2~…an important point to note about child care provider subsidy programs is that providers must meet certain criteria in order to be eigible for subsidies. Generally, only liscensed providers that meet state standards are eligible for subsidies.

327~D1~M3~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in addition to the aggregate variables, a quadratic time trend and state dummies were also included in some of the estimated models.
327~DV14~L22~Variable Value~Marginal Subsidy Rate 2~…in the case of the Child Care Food Program, the subsidies can be used only for certain expenses (food and food preparation), and Head Start is an early childhood development program, not a child care program. Thus it might appear that these subsidies are irrelevant for many providers, particulary self-employed child care workers who care for children under informal arrangements. However, as long as the child care market is reasonably competitive and there is some substitutability among different forms of child care, the price of child care and therefore the average level of wages of child care workers should be affected by these programs.
327~D1~V5~Variable~Legal Maximum Child-Staff Ratio~…the maximum legal child-staff ratio typically varies with the age of the children in care. The author uses the ratio that applies to 2 year-old children in day care centers.
327~D1~V15~Variable~Minimum Skill Requirement~…the regulations governing educational qualifications are so varied across states that it was not clear how to construct a continuous measure of qualifications. Instead, the author uses a dummy variable indicating whether a state imposes any educational qualification on child care providers in day care centers.
327~D1~V2~Variable~Unit Price of Skill~…the theoretical model implies that the skill prices of child care and other sector work depend on the aggregate determinants of demand for and supply of labor in each sector, as well as the policy variables.
327~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…it is important to include measures of other aggregate variables in the model in order to obtain consistent estimates of the effects of the policy variables of interest. The aggregate variables that the researchers has included are the legal minimum wage rate, the unemployment rate, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefit level, average family income other than the woman's earnings, the age, race, and educational composition of the female population, the industrial structure of employment, a quadratic time trend, and dummies for states.

The aggregate variables that the researchers has included are the legal minimum wage rate, the unemployment rate, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefit level, average family income other than the woman's earnings, the age, race, and educational composition of the female population, the industrial structure of employment, a quadratic time trend, and dummies for states.
327~D1~V25~Variable~Minimum Wage~…the minimum wage is measured on a year-specific basis.
327~D1~DV25~Derived Variable~Time Trend~…the time trend is measured on a year-specific basis.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the aggregate variables were computed using the full samples on the 1977-87 CPS tapes.
327~D1~M4~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the weights used in the estimation to adjust for the choice-based sample results in high standard errors for the coefficients that determine the probability of choosing the child care sector.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the weight applied to each observation is the ratio of the population share to the sample share of the sector chosen by the individual.
327~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Proportion of Women in State Aged 18-30~…the population shares were estimated from the CPS tapes.
327~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Proportion of Women in State Aged 31-45~…the population shares were estimated from the CPS tapes.
327~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Proportion of Women in State, Education~…the population shares were estimated from the CPS tapes.
327~D1~DV24~Derived Variable~Proportion of Women, Marital Status~…the population shares were estimated from the CPS tapes.
327~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Proportion of Blacks in State~…the population shares were estimated from the CPS tapes.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the population shares were estimated from the CPS tapes.
327~D1~F3~Findings~Logit Regression Results~…in the logit regressions, the only variables with reasonably precise estimates for the child care sector are education, which has a positive impact on the probability of becoming a child care worker, and the number of children aged five and under (NKLE5), which has a negative effect. The coefficients determining the probability of choosing to work in the other sector are quite precisely estimated in most cases, including those on several of the policy variables. It is not clear why the policy variables influence the probability of choosing the other sector, given their lack of statistically significant effects on the probability of choosing the child care sector. Results indicate taht these variables have little influence on the wages of other sector workers and also appear to have no direct impact on choice of sector via the budget constraint. It is possible that they are picking up unmeasured effects specific to particular states and years, although the inclusion of many other state-year-specific variables, as well as state dummies, in the model should have helped control for such effects.
327~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…the purpose of the wage models is to provide estimates of the skill prices facing each woman in the data.
327~D1~F4~Findings~Log Wage Regression Aggregate Covariate Results~…in the log wage regressions, the maximum child care tax credit (MAXCRED) has a positive effect on wages of child care workers, and provider subsidies through Head Start and the Child Care Food Program (PRODSUB) have a negative effect on other workers' wages. A number of the other aggregate variables have statistically significant associations with the wage rate of child care workers. Child care workers' wages are higher in states and years with higher average income (other than women's earnings), a higher proportion of blacks in the population, and higher proportions of employment in transportation, communication, public utilities, finance, insurance, real estate, and the professions, and a lower proportion of employment in the public sector. The only effect for other workers that is similar is the positive state average income effect. Omitting the state dummies and some of the other aggregate variables results in substantial changes in the coefficient estimates on the policy variables and lower standard errors. However, excluding the state dummies is strongly rejected by an F-test for the child care wage equation and is rejected at the 5% but not the 1% level in the other sector wage equation. This underscores the importance of controlling for other aggregate variables in order to obtain consistent estimates of the effects of the policy variables.
327~D1~F5~Findings~Log Wage Regression Individual Covariate Results~…among the individual characterstics, the log wage regression results indicate that black child care workers have 10% higher wages than white child care workers, returns to education are lower for child care workers than for other sector workers, wages are higher for both groups in SMSAs, age does not influence wages of child care workers, and young children are negatively associated with wages in both sectors, while older children are positively associated with wages in the child care sector. the results for the individual-level variables show that the structure of wages of child care workers is quite different from the structure of wages for other women. The differences in the effects of age, race, and education are particulary striking. Selectivity seems to be an important factor in both sectors, as indicated by the statistically significant coefficient estimates on the correction terms, and by the fact that a number of the coefficient estimates change substantially when the correction terms are omitted.
327~D1~M1~Methodology~Log Wage~…estimates of log([pi](2)) and log([pi](3)) for each woman were computed from the wage-equation estimates.
327~D1~M5~Methodology~Structural Logit~…estimated log skill prices were included in a structural logit model of choice of sector, based on equations (2) - (4). A number of alternative models were estimated as well.
327~D1~F6~Findings~Structural Logit Model Results~…the results of the structural logit model indicated that a model that included the state dummy variables provided a substantial imporvement in the fit compared to the basic structural model. Once the state dummies were included, models with additional variables did not provide any further significant improvement in the fit. The state dummies may serve as proxies for unmeasured policy variables, or possibly individual variables.
327~D1~F7~Findings~Log Likelihood of Multinomial Logit Results With and Without State Dummies~…the log likelihood for the multinomial logit model without state dummies was -9,141, compared to -9,086 for th model with state dummies. The test statistic is 110. the 5% critical value is 124. 
327~D1~M4~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the model including the state dummies is used to correct for selection on choice of sector in the wage and hours equations.
327~D1~F8~Findings~Mean Squared Errors for the Log Wage Models With and Without State Dummies~…the mean squared errors for the log wage models without state dummies were .5625 and .3098, or child care workers and other workers, respectively.
327~D1~F9~Findings~Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic~…the test statistic from a likelihood ratio test for including the state dummies is 194 with 100 degrees of freedom.
327~D1~F10~Findings~Average Elasticity of the Probability of Child Care Entry~…the average elasticity of the probability of choosing to be a child care worker with respect to the skill price, computed for each individual and averaged over the entire sample, is .83 using the results without state dummies and is 1.20 using the results with state dummies.
327~D1~F11~Findings~Average Elasticity of the Probability of Other Work Entry~…the average elasticity of the probability of choosing the other sector with respect to its skill price is .35 using the results wihtout state dummies and is .52 using the results with state dummies.
327~D1~F12~Findings~Child Care Skill Price and the Probability of Sector Entry~…the predicted negative impact of the child care skill price on the probability of choosing the other sector does not appear in estimates, and the coefficient estimate is in fact positive, though statistically insignificant at the 10% level, with an average elasticity of only .06. The absence of negative estimates of the effect of the cost of child care on labor force participation may result from the feature of the sample that many women do not have young children since the study is on the supply of child care labor.
327~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the sample in this study includes many women who do not have young children since the focus of the study is on the supply of child care labor.
327~D1~M2~Methodology~Log Linear~…presents estimates of the structural hours of work equations with and without state dummies.
327~D1~F13~Findings~Structural Hours of Work Aggregate Covariate Results~…the structural hours of work model results indicate a positive, statistically significant effect of [pi](2) on the hours worked by child care workers, with an elasticity of .318 in the model without state dummies and .741 in the model with state dummies. The coefficient estimate on [pi](2) and [pi](3) for other workers are both small and statistically insignificant. The child care tax credit subsidy rate (CCTC) has a positive effect on the hours of other sector workers, statistically significant at the 5% level. The coefficient estimates on the other subsidy and regulation variables are all statistically insignificant.
327~D1~F14~Findings~Structural Hours of Work Individual Covariate Results~…the structural hours of work model results on the individual variables indicate positive effects on hours worked of education, SMSA, residence, age (at the mean ages), being black, presence of other adults in the household, and negative effects of young children and older children, living with one's parents, and husband's and other income. These results are similar across sectors, although the magnitudes differ in some cases. Children aged 6 to 11 have a negative effect on hours for other sector workers, and being never married has a positive effect for child care workers. The selectivity correction coefficient is positive and statistically significant for child care workers when the state dummies are included.
327~D1~F15~Derived Variable~Expected Hours of Work in the Child Care Sector~…expected hours of work in the child care sector are given by E(H(2) = pr(D = 2)E(H(2)|D = 2), where D is an indicator variable for choice of sector, with D = 2 indicating the child care sector.
327~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Elasticity of Child Care Labor Supply~…the elasticity of the expected hours of work in the child care sector is given by the sum of the elasticities of pr(D = 2) and E(H(2)|D = 2) with respect to [pi](2).
327~D1~F16~Findings~Elasticity of Child Care Labor Supply Estimates~…the elasticity of child care labor supply is estimated to be 1.15 based on the results without state dummies and 1.94 based on the results including state dummies. The relatively large magnitude of these estimates could help explain why child care workers' wages failed to rise in response to substantial increases in the demand for child care labor during the sample period. However, the elasticity estimates may not be large enough to fully account for the fact that child care workers' wages remained flat over the 1976-86 period. Furthermore, the underlying parameter estimates are not highly robust in magnitude, so the evidence of a relatively high supply of child care must be considered tentative.
327~D1~F17~Findings~F-Statistic With State Dummies Across Sectors~…the F-statistic from a test for including the state dummies is 1.758 for child care workers and 1.122 for other workers. The critical value of an F(50, oo) variable is 1.35 at the 5% level and 1.52 at the 1% level. An example of another specification is one that included all the policy variables for both groups of workers as well as AFDCBEN and UNEMRATE along with the state dummies. The F-statistic for a test of this model against the model with the state dummies is 2.81 with four restrictions for child care workers and .915 with six restrictions for other workers. The critical values of an F(4, oo) variable are 2.37 at the 5% level and 3.32 at the 1% level, while the corresponding values for an F(6, oo) variable are 2.09 and 2.80.
327~D1~DV26~Derived Variable~Age^2/100~…age-squared divided by 100 as included in an individual determinant vector in logit regressions.
327~V1~L2~Variable Value~Not Participation in the Labor Force~…the omitted category in regressional analysis is nonparticipants in the labor force.
327~D1~DV27~Derived Variable~Year~…the year variable is equal to the calendar year minus 1900.

328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Using Current Population Survey data for 1983-93, this article analyzes where there is union membership wage premium among full-time, private sector employees covered by union contracts. 
328~D1~T1~Time Period~1989-1993~Using Current Population Survey data for 1983-93, this article analyzes where there is union membership wage premium among full-time, private sector employees covered by union contracts. 
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Using Current Population Survey data for 1983-93, this article analyzes where there is union membership wage premium among full-time, private sector employees covered by union contracts. 
328~D1~F1~Findings~Membership Wage Premium Estimates~"Ordinary least squares estimates of the membership wage premium are 12%-14% and allowing membership to be endogenous yields larger estimates. Differences in job tenure, unobservable characteristics, and measurement error cannot fully explain the estimated premium. Significant differences in this premium, as well as in membership rates conditional upon coverage, across various demographic subgroups are also documented. In general, ""free riders"" do not appear to be free riding. These results have important implications for the voluminous union-nonunion wage gap literature. Moreover, these results can increase the understanding of the nature of labor unions in the United States and highlight a notable area of inquiry for further increasing this understanding."
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…in the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 1983 and 1993, 10% of private sector employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are not union members.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~…standard estimates of the union-nonunion wage gap are larger using memberhsip rather than coverage as an indicator of union status.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~Using Current Population Survey data for 1983-93, this article analyzes where there is union membership wage premium among full-time, private sector employees covered by union contracts. 
328~D1~F2~Findings~Union Effect Estimates for Union Membership and Union Coverage~…in log wage regressions using the 1991 CPS (including the standard demographic variables), the estimated union effect is 0.181 if union membership is used to measure union status and 0.171 if union coverage is used.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~"There are several reasons why a wage premium for members relative to covered nonmembers might be estimated. First, nonmembers may be discriminated against. In spite of the legal duty of fair representation, unions may try to discriminate against nonmembers in order to discourage free riding while employers may try to discriminate against nonmembers to reduce labor costs. Second, employee probationary periods, during which individuals are not required to join the union, may yield average covered nonmembers with shorter tenures and lower wages than average members. This phenomenon includes, but is not limited to, temporary workers. Third, union members may have a higher level of human capital as the result of union training or apprenticeship programs. Fourth, there may be unobservable differences between members and nonmembers, such as motivation, ability, or the intention to stay in a certain job and invest in firm-specific human capital (including union membership). Fifth, covered nonmembers may be more likely in weak unions with lower wage premia. Finally, union coverage might be measured with greater error than union membership, so an estimated coverage effect is biased toward zero. However, note that only some of these reasons are ""true"" union membership effects while others involve econometric and estimation problems. For example, the probationary period conjecture is an omitted variable problem."
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the analysis below investigates whether there is a union membership wage premium using data on 19,102 private sector, full-time employees in the CPS outgoing groups between 1983 and 1993. All of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and reside in right-to-work states.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the analysis below investigates whether there is a union membership wage premium using data on 19,102 private sector, full-time employees in the CPS outgoing groups between 1983 and 1993. All of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and reside in right-to-work states.
328~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~In the United States, an individual seeking employment is faced with a choice between nonunion jobs and jobs covered by a union contract. An individual selecting, or being selected for, a job covered by a union contract then faces an additional decision: whether to join the union and become a union member. there are a variety of legal and practical factors that may influence this decision, and these factors serve as foundation for analyzing wage differntials between members and covered nonmembers.
328~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~The U.S. private sector legal framework provides labor unions with a duty of fair representation obligating them to impartially and without discrimination serve all bargaining unit employees when representing employees vis-à-vis the employer (Steele v. Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, 323 U.S. 1942 [1944]; Wallace Corporation v. NLRB 323 U.S. 248 [1944]). Therefore, members and covered nonmembers are entitled to equal application of the contract terms (Bedding, Curtain and Drapery Workers Local 1940 [Englander Co.], 109 NERB 326 [1954]) and identical representation in the grievance process (Port Drum company, 170 NLRB 555 [1968]). Employers, too, violate the law when they treat union members and covered nonmembers differently (Gaynor News Company, 347 U.S. 17 [1954]; Rockaway News Supply Co., 94 NLRB 1056 [1951]). In short, within a bargaining unit, union members and covered nonmembers who occupy the same jobs and are otherwise similar should be compensated with the same wage and benefits package.
328~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~"A major difference between members and covered nonmembers, however, is the payment of union dues. Full members pay full union dues, which typically amount to 2 hours of wages per month. Depending on the union contract, covered nonmembers may pay partial or no dues. Unless there is a right-to-work law preventing it, a union shop or agency shop clause in the union contract compels nonmembers to pay the fraction of full dues that are ""germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment"" (Communications Workers v. Back, 487 U.S. 735, 745 [1988]). This payment is sometimes referred to as an ""agency fee"" and excludes support for union expenses such as political contributions, charitable contributions, organizing expenses, conventions, and union publications. In the absence of a union shop or agency shop clause, covered nonmembers can refrain from making payments to the union."
328~D1~V2~Variable~Union Dues~A major difference between members and covered nonmembers, however, is the payment of union dues. Full members pay full union dues, which typically amount to 2 hours of wages per month. Depending on the union contract, covered nonmembers may pay partial or no dues. In the absence of a union shop or agency shop clause, covered nonmembers can refrain from making payments to the union.
328~V2~L1~Variable Value~Agency Fee~"Unless there is a right-to-work law preventing it, a union shop or agency shop clause in the union contract compels nonmembers to pay the fraction of full dues that are ""germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment"" (Communications Workers v. Back, 487 U.S. 735, 745 [1988]). This payment is sometimes referred to as an ""agency fee"" and excludes support for union expenses such as political contributions, charitable contributions, organizing expenses, conventions, and union publications. "
328~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~"Union and Agency shop clauses may also affect individual decisions whether to become a union member. Taken at face value, union shop clauses require union membership as a condition of continued employment after some initial time period (e.g., 30 days). While union shop clauses are unenforceable and the payment of agency fees suffices (""membership, as a condition of employment is whittled down to its financial core,"" NLRB v. General Motors Corp. 373 U.S. 734 [1963]), this fact appears to be not widely known, and many individuals may be misled into becoming union members. "
328~D1~V2~Variable~Union Status~...if an individual is required to pay agency fees amounting to, for example, 80% of full dues, the marginal cost of becoming a full member is reduced and membership may be more likely.
328~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~When a union is not functioning as the exclusive bargaining agent of the bargaining unit vis-à-vis the employer, it has the discretion to treat members and nonmembers differently. Unions are similar to other private organizations in providing benefits to members only: scholarships, group life insurance options, credit cards, publications, housing assistance, rental car discounts, legal assistance, and training programs. Because workers' compensation does not stem from the collective bargaining agreement, unions can limit assistance in obtaining workers' compensation to members (American Postal Workers Union, NLRB Advice Memorandum No. 31-CB-3755 [1980]).
328~D1~V1~Variable~Union Status~"Members and nonmembers can also bne treated differently in the context of union governance. As with other private organizations, only members can hold office and vote. Nonmembers do not have to be given the right to vote in contract ratification ballots (North Coast Counties District Council of Carpenters [Cotati Cabinet Manufacturing Corp.], 197 NLRB 905 [1972]), in strike authorization votes (Amoco Production Co., 262 NLRB 1240 [1932]), or in affiliation or merger proceedings (Santa Barbara Humane Society, 302 NLRB 833 [1991]). Similarly, only union members are subject to internal union disciplinary procedures and penalties (Carpenters Local 740 [Tacoma Boatbuilding], 277 NLRB 513 [1985]). The union member ""Bill of Rights"" in the Landrum-Griffin Act does not apply to covered nonmembers, and it is likely that covered nonmembers who do not pay dues or agency fees can be denied strike benefits (Kolinske v. Lubbers, 712 F.2d 471 [D.C. Cir. 1983])."
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~The institutional realities of members vs. nonmembers provide a framework for considering wage differentials between union members and covered nonmembers. First, unions have an incentive to reward members and punish covered non-members via (illegal) discriminatory application and administration of contract terms in order to discourage free riding. If unions are successful in this endeavor, one will observe higher wages for members. Second, employers have incentives to (illegally) treat members and covered nonmembers differentlyu. To weaken union support, employers may try to penalize members while, to reduce labor costs, employers may try to exploit worker ignorance and not pay covered nonmembers their full contractual wage. In either case, wages of members and nonmembers will differ.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~...[cont.]... Third, if union or agency shop clauses or inducing individuals to become members at the conclusion of the probationary period, union members will, on average, have longer tenure at the firm than covered nonmembers. Since tenure is often positively correlated with wages, members would be predicted to have higher wages than covered non-members. Fourth, there may be unobservable differences between members and covered nonmembers that are correlated with wage outcomes. As was noted, covered nonmembers can be legally excluded from receiving some union benefits such as participation in union governance or group rate optional life insurance. If, for example, conscientious individuals are more productive and earn a higher wage and also are more likely to want to participate in union governance or purchase additional life insurance, then union members will have higher wages than covered nonmembers. Fifth, union members may have greater levels of human capital because of union training programs, which might yield higher wages for members relative to covered nonmembers .Finally, an additional possibility for estimating a wage differential between union members and covered nonmembers is measurement error. Covered nonmembership may be more likely to be reported in error so that measurement error biases a coverage effect toward zero.
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~The data for this study come from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey of approximately 60,000 households that includes labor market information representative of the U.S. noninstitutional population aged 16 and older (see U.S. Department of Labor 1992).
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"Beginning in 1983, the CPS asked individuals, ""On this job, is… a member of a labor union or an employee association similar to a union?"" Respondents who answered no are then asked, ""On this job, is… covered by a union or employee association contract?"" Researchers categorize those answering yes to the first question as union members and those answering yes to the second question as covered nonmembers. Note that the second question is not asked if a respondent answer yes to the first question; these individuals are assumed to be covered by a collective bargaining agreement."

Researchers categorize those answering yes to the first question as union members and those answering yes to the second question as covered nonmembers.

328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Households selected to be interviewed for the CPS are surveyed for 4 months, not surveyd for 8 months, and surveyed again for 4 months. The data for this study are from the Annual Earnings Files, which inlclude only individuals in the fourth month of each 4-month survey period, that is, only individuals in the outgoing rotation groups. to avoid duplicate individuals, most of the analyses use only those leaving the survey for the last time, that is survey month 8.
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Using the Annual Earnings Files for 1983-93 compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research and extracting all private sector, full-time employees excluding the self-employed and those not covered by a collective bargaining agreement yields 90,824 covered individuals with valid data. Of these covered employees, 81,763, or 90.0%, are union members.
328~D1~V3~Variable~State Right-to-Work Laws~Figure 1 illustrates that at the beginning of the sample period for the data (1983), 20 states had right-to-work laws. Additionally, Idaho enacted a right-to-work law effective in early 1985. Figure 1 also illustrates that the right-to-work states are primarily in the south, with a few in the farm belt and in the Rocky Mountain states.
328~D1~V3~Variable~State Right-to-Work Laws~In the absence of such laws, that is, in non-right-to-work states, unions are free to negotiate union shop provisions requiring union memberships after a short probationary period.

328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~...in the CPS between 1983 and 1993, 91.77% of private sector full-time employees covered by a union contract are union members in non-right-to-work states compared to 83.73% in right-to-work states. Consequently, researchers limit the sample to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in right-to-work states only, which yields a sample of 19,102 observations with 15,994 (83.73%) union members.
328~D1~V3~Variable~State Right-to-Work Laws~Note that researchers are not analyzing the impact of right-to-work laws per se but, rather, limiting their sample to right-to-work states to isolate situations in which workers are free to choose their preferred union status. If researchers conduct their analysis using all states, the results are qualitatively very similar, but the estimated magnitudes are several percentage points lower. This is consistent with the presence of individuals who become union members in the absence of a right-to-work law where the true range of membership options is less likely to be freely available.

328~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Log Usual Real Hourly Wage~To investigate the union membership wage premium, researchers constructed the log usual real hourly wage as the logarithm of the ratio of weekly earnings to usual hours deflated by the year's average consumer price index (1993 = 100).
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~To investigate the union membership wage premium, researchers constructed the log usual real hourly wage as the logarithm of the ratio of weekly earnings to usual hours deflated by the year's average consumer price index (1993 = 100).
328~D1~F3~Findings~Mean Log Real Wage and Wage Premium for Union Members~Table 1 illustrates that the mean log real wage for the 15,995 union members is 2.552 and the mean for the 3,107 covered nonmembers is 2.391. This simple comparison of means suggests a statistically significant union membership wage premium of 17.47%.
328~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Log Wage Frequency Distributions~Figure 2 presents (smoothed) relative frequency distributions for the log real wage for covered nonmembers an dunion members. The covered nonmembers wage distribution has more variance but less negative skewness than the union member distribution.
328~D1~F4~Findings~Log Wage Frequency Distributions Estimates~…when examining the log wage frequency distributions, the covered nonmember wage distribution has more variance but lessnegative skewness than the union member distribution. The union wge premium also decreases as one moves up each distribution: at the tenth percentile the difference between log real wages for members and covered nonmembers is 0.189, whereas at the ninetieth percentile the difference is 0.050.
328~V1~L5~Variable Value~Nonmember Financial Contributors~…agency shop clauses create a third class of covered employees: nonmember financial contributors. This class cannot be distinguished from non-members paying no dues in the CPS data, so excluding non-right-work states avoids this complication.
328~D1~V5~Variable~Completed Education~…indicates the level of completed education for a Current Population Survey respondent.
328~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Potential Experience~…indicates the potential experience (age - education - 6) for a Current Population Survey respondent.
328~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Potential Experience Squared~…indicates the potential experience (age - education - 6) squared and divided by 100 for a Current Population Survey respondent.
328~D1~V6~Variable~Age~…indicates the age of a Current Population Survey respondent.
328~D1~V7~Variable~Gender~…a dichotomous variable that indicates whether or not a Current Population Survey respondent is female.
328~D1~V8~Variable~Race~…a dichotomous variable that indicates whether or not a Current Population Survey respondent is nonwhite.
328~D1~V10~Variable~Marital Status~…a dichotomous variable that indicates whether or not a Current Population Survey respondent is married.
328~D1~V11~Variable~State Unemployment Rate~…indicates the state unemployment rate in time period t.

328~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Log Usual Real Hourly Wage~…the dependent variable in analyses of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement in right-to-work states.
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Full-time, private sector, covered (by a collective bargaining agreement) employees from the CPS outgoing rotation groups (month 8), 1983-93.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Column 3 of table 1 presents the results of estimating a standard log wage regression using ordinary least squares (OLS) correcting the standard error for arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity using White's (1980) method. This model is analogous to the standard OLS regression equation in the union wage gap literature in which the union wage gap is estimated by including a dummy variable for union status (Lewis 1986).
328~D1~F5~Findings~Average Percent Wage Differential~The implied average percent wage differential between union members and covered nonmembers from the regression in column 3 is 12.10. With 19,102 observations, it is unsurprising that this effect is very precisely estimated and therefore statistically significant, with a t-statistic of 15.96.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The regression also includes 10 year effect, 8 major industry effects, 7 major occupation, and 20 state efects - and each group is jointly statistically significant with a p-value less than .0001.
328~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Implied Percent Differential~The implied percent differential of the coefficient [Beta] with variance V([Beta]) is calculated as 100(exp[[Beta] - 0.5V([Beta]) - 1).
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The regression model in column 3 of table 1 constrains all of the wage determinants except union membership to be equal for union members and covered nonmembers. If the earnings structure differs between these two groups, then separte equations should be estimated. Columns 4 and 5 of table 1 therefore present the results of estimating separate member and covered nonmember wage regressions.
328~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Chow Test~…a Chow test for p value < .001 is implemented to test the null hypothesis of equality of all of the coefficients across the two sectors.
328~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Wald Test~…a Wald test for p value < .001 is implemented to test the null hypothesis of equality of all of the coefficients across the two sectors.
328~D1~F6~Findings~Rejection of the Null Hypothesis~A Chow test (p-value < .001) and a Wald test (p-value < .001) both reject the null hypothesis of equality of all of the coefficients across the two sectors.
328~D1~F7~Findings~Economic Returns to Education and Experience for Union vs. Nonunion Members~Relative to covered nonmembers, union members are estimated to have slightly lower economic returns to years of education and experience (i.e., flatter earnings profiles). Union members' wages are also found to differ more by gender and race relative to covered nonmember wages.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~To estimate the implied wage differential between members and covered nonmembers implicit in columns 4 and 5, consider the average predicted values from each regression using the entire sample.
328~D1~F8~Findings~Difference in Average Log Real Wages~The difference in the average log real wages predicted by each equation (columns 4 and 5 using the entire sample) is 0.136. In other words, only 15% of the 0.161 raw log wage differential can be explained by differences in characteristics between union members and covered nonmembers, and the union membership wage premium is estimated to be roughly 14%. note that this is not a trivial premium relative to the conventional wisdom union-nonunion wage gap of 15-20%.
328~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Union Member Percentages~As further documentation of the situation, it is instructive to consider union membership among covered employees and the union membership wage premium within various subgroups. To this end, table 2 presents the union member percentages conditional upon coverage by various categories.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~As further documentation of the situation, it is instructive to consider union membership among covered employees and the union membership wage premium within various subgroups. To this end, table 2 presents the union member percentages conditional upon coverage by various categories.
328~D1~F9~Findings~Demographics and the Propensity to be a Union Member~Men are nearly 10 percentage points more likely to be union members than women, married employees are nearly 6 percentage points more likely to be union members, and older workers are more likely to be union members. Workers who did not complete high school are 8 percentage pointys more likely to be union members than workers who continued their education past the completion of high school. Workers in construction are the most likely to be union members while workers in white collar occupations are less  likely to be union members than those in blue collar occupations. While some of these differences may seem unsurprising, it is important to remember that these percentages are all conditional upon being covered by a union contract. So, for example, while it is widely known that wholesale and retail trade have lower rates of union coverage, table 2 illustrates that they also have lower rates of membership within those bargaining units that are represented by a union.
328~D1~F10~Findings~Right-to-Work Laws and the Union-Nonunion Wage Gap~In standard OLS log wage equations using the 1991 CPS and using union membership to indicate union status, researchers find a union-nonunion gap of 0.204 in right-to-work states and 0.169 in non-right-to-work states. Thus, researhcers use 15%-20% as the conventional wisdom for the union-nonunion wage gap in right-to-work states.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Table 2 presents ordinary least squares regression of log real usual hourly wage on education, experience, experience squares, the state unemployment rate, and indicator variables for gender, race, marital status, state, industry, occupation, year, and union member. Standard errors are robust to arbitrary forms of heteroskedasticity.

328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Columns 3 and 4 of table 2 present the union member coefficients and standard errors from OLS regressions of the log real wage on the same independent variables as in table 1 but stratified by various subgroups.
328~D1~F11~Findings~Membership Wage Premium and the Return to Union Membership~…in columns 3 and 4, in terms of demographic differences in the membership wage premium, the premium appears larger for men than for women, but little differences are evident by race or marital status. The return to union membership also declines with education. Finally, there are also sizable differences across industries and occupations. Especially notable is the 20% premium in construction, which will be addressed below. While it is beyond the scope of this article to investigate explanations for all of the differences evident in table 2, the results of table 2 highlight an important area of future research.
328~D1~F12~Findings~Year-by-Year Analyses Estimates~Year-by-year analyses (not reported) indicate that the results are not an artifact of pooling the data across 11 years. While there is variation in the returns to union membership across the sample years, the wage differential is greater than 7% and statistically significant in each year. There is not a statistically significant correlation between state unemployment rates, membership rates, and wage premia across years, suggesting that the year variation in membership rates and returns is not related to the business cycle.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~The results from tables 1 and 2 imply that among full-time, private sector employees covered by union contracts there is a nontrivial premium associated with being a union member, albeit with differences across subgroups. The remainder of this article investigates possible factors explaining the membership premium. Differences in standard, observable demographic characteristics such as education do not appear to explain the wage differential between members and covered nonmembers because the regressions in tables 1 and 2 include the standard controls.
328~D1~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~…the sample consists of full-time, private sector, covered (by a collective bargaining agreeement) employees from the CPS outgoing rotation groups (month 8), 1983-93. The dependent variable is log real usual hourly earnings. Standard errors are in parentheses. Sample size is 19,102. This model instruments for union membership using the independent variables plus indicator variables for state restrictions on union political contributions and state-year averages for public university tuition, the unemployment takeup rate, and the cost of life insurance. 
328~D1~M3~Methodology~Heckman Selection~…the sample consists of full-time, private sector, covered (by a collective bargaining agreeement) employees from the CPS outgoing rotation groups (month 8), 1983-93. The dependent variable is log real usual hourly earnings. Standard errors are in parentheses. Sample size is 19,102. This model instruments for union membership using the independent variables plus indicator variables for state restrictions on union political contributions and state-year averages for public university tuition, the unemployment takeup rate, and the cost of life insurance. Maximum likelihood Heckman selection estimates jointly estimated with a probit for union status using the independent variables plus indicators variables for state restrictions on union political contributions and state-year averages for public university tuition, the unemployment insurance takeup rate, and the cost of life insurance.
328~D1~M4~Methodology~Instrumental Variable Method~…the sample consists of full-time, private sector, covered (by a collective bargaining agreeement) employees from the CPS outgoing rotation groups (month 8), 1983-93.

328~D1~V21~Variable~Cost of Life Insurance~…the cost of life insurance is controlled for in TSLS regressions.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Econometrically, the OLS estimation strategy used in tables 1 and 2 assumes that the error term is uncorrelated with membership status and does not account for possible endogeneity or selection bias.
328~D1~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~…table 3 presents the results of modeling nonrandom selection into union membership using three different stategies. As is well known, the task in this context is to find instruments correlated with the endogenous variable, in this case union membership, yet uncorrelated with the wage rate. Researchers use the following five variables: a dummy variable for states (at time t) that prohibit political contributions by unions; a dummy variable for states that restrict, but do not prohibit, political contributions; and state-year averages for public university tuition, unemployment insurance takeup rates, and the cost of life insurance. The rationale for the latter three variables is that these are unlikely to be correlated with an individual's wage, but because they are services that unions typically provide only for members they may be correlated with union membership status. The two indicator variables pertaining to political contributions reflect the fact that while federal law prohibits direct union contributions to politcal campaigns (and hence the impetus for political action committees or PACs), there is state-by-state variation in local laws pertaining to state and local elections. Researchers can think of no reason why these laws would be correlated with wages, but they may influence wheter someone joins a union.
328~D1~M3~Methodology~Heckman Selection~…table 3 presents the results of modeling nonrandom selection into union membership using three different stategies.
328~D1~M4~Methodology~Instrumental Variable Method~…table 3 presents the results of modeling nonrandom selection into union membership using three different stategies.

328~D1~V20~Variable~Public University Tuition~…state averages for public university tuition.
328~D1~V20~Variable~Public University Tuition~…the rationale for including public university tuition, unemployment insurance takeup rates, and the cost of life insurance is that these are unlikely to be correlated with an individual's wage, but because they are services that unions typically provide only for members they may be correlated with union membership status.
328~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Unemployment Insurance Takeup Rate~…the rationale for including public university tuition, unemployment insurance takeup rates, and the cost of life insurance is that these are unlikely to be correlated with an individual's wage, but because they are services that unions typically provide only for members they may be correlated with union membership status.
328~D1~V21~Variable~Cost of Life Insurance~…the rationale for including public university tuition, unemployment insurance takeup rates, and the cost of life insurance is that these are unlikely to be correlated with an individual's wage, but because they are services that unions typically provide only for members they may be correlated with union membership status.
328~D1~V18~Variable~Contribution Prohibition~The two indicator variables pertaining to a political contributions reflect the fact that while federal law prohibits direct union contributions to polital campaigns (and hence the impetus for political action committes or PACs), there is state-by-state variation in local laws pertaining to state and local elections. Researchers can think of no reason why these laws would be correlated with wages, but they may influence whether someone joins a union.
328~D1~V19~Variable~Contribution Restrictions~The two indicator variables pertaining to a political contributions reflect the fact that while federal law prohibits direct union contributions to polital campaigns (and hence the impetus for political action committes or PACs), there is state-by-state variation in local laws pertaining to state and local elections. Researchers can think of no reason why these laws would be correlated with wages, but they may influence whether someone joins a union.
328~D1~M2~Methodology~Two-Stage Least Squares~Column 1 of table 3 reports the two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimates instrumenting for union membership using the independent variables in table 3 plus the five variables described in the previous paragraph.
328~D1~F13~Findings~TSLS Estimation Results~…the TSLS estimate of the union membership wage effect is much larger than the OLS estimate, 0.573 compared to 0.114, with a p-value of .007. The OLS estimate does not appear biased upward by the failure to control for nonrandom selection.
328~D1~M3~Methodology~Heckman Selection~Perhaps the most popular method for addressing the nonrandom selection of union and nonunion samples is the Heckman (1976) selection correction method. Applying this logic to the union membership-covered nonmembershi case, consider a choice equation for union membership status where q(i) is the (reduced form) unobserved utility gain for individual i from being a union member compared to being a covered nonmember, and X(i) is a vector of characteristics. Only if q(i) > 0 do researchers observe the union member wage of individual i as a union member where m denotes union member and W denotes the real wage. Nonrandom selection implies that the union status error term is correlated with the wage equation error term. The Heckman method jointly estimates equations (1) and (2) using maximum likelihood, assuming these error terms have a joing normal distribution.
328~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Union Member Utility Gain~…q(i) is the (reduced form) unobserved utility gain for individual (i) from being a union member compared to being a covered nonmember.
328~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Characteristics~…X(i) is a vector of charateristics.
328~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Union Member Utility Gain~…only if q(i)>0 do researchers observe the union member wage of individual (i) as a union member.
328~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Log Usual Real Hourly Wage~…only if q(i)>0 do researchers observe the union member wage of individual (i) as a union member where m denotes uninon member and W denotes the real wage.
328~D1~M3~Methodology~Heckman Selection~The union member wage equation results of this estimation are presented in column 2 of table 3. The union status probit model estimates are presented in appendix table A1 and include the independent variable plus the five identifiers. Repeating the stimation for covered nonmembers yields a the wage equation results reported in column 3 of table 3. The probit results are not reported because they are the reverse of the union member probit estimates.
328~D1~F14~Findings~Heckman Selection Estimation Results~In the Heckman selection estimation framework, the null hypothesis of exogeneity can be tested by testing whether the error term correlation equals zero. As shown near the bottom of table 3, the estimated correlations are positive and, for covered nonmembers, statistically significant (p-value < .001). The implied membership log wage differential from the two equations is 0.482, which is much larger than the OLS two-equation estimate of 0.136. This increase is consistent with the union-nonunion wage gap results.
328~D1~M4~Methodology~Instrumental Variable Method~As an alternative to the strong distributional assumptions necessary for the Heckman method, Duncan and Leigh (1985) developed an instrumental variables estimator for the union-nonunion wage gap. Applying this technique to the member-covered nonmember problem, first note that the natural log of real wages is equal to M(i)lnW(mi) + (1 - M(i) lnW(ci) where m indicates members (q(i) > 0; M(i) = 1) and c indicates covered nonmembers (q(i) <= 0; M(i) = 0). Substituting (2) and a covered nonmember analogue into equation (3) yields a equation (4). To account for the potential correlation between membership status and the error term, Duncan and Leight's (1985) method constructs estimates the sample mean of M(i) using logit estimates of equation (1). Then equation (4) is estimated using instrumental variables, where the instruments are M^(i)X(mi) and (1 - M^(i)) X(ci) (including the intercept in the X matrices). Assuming that the joint distribution for members is identical to the distribution for nonmembers, this instrumental variables estimator is consistent.
328~D1~M4~Methodology~Instrumental Variable Method~...the results of applying this estimation strategy to the union member-covered nonmember situation are presented in columns 4 and 5 of table 3. Note that the results presented in columns 4 and 5 are from a single regression (equation 4). Following Duncan and Leigh (1985), equation (1) is eestimated using a logit model (and includes the same identifying variables as the probit in appendix table A1).
328~D1~F15~Findings~Instrumental Variable Method Estimation Results~The implied log wage difference between members and nonmembers in the instrumental variable regression is 0.143, which is much closer to the OLS estimates than the other nonrandom estimates.
328~D1~F16~Findings~Endogeneity Test~To test for endogeneity, the Hausman test statistic is an F-statistics of 4.662, which easily rejects the null hypothesis of exogeneity at conventional levels of significance.
328~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~Instrumental Variables~…the instruments are M^(i)X(mi) and (1 - M^(i)X(ci) (including the intercept in the X matrices).
328~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Hausman Test~A Hausman test can be used to test for endogeneity but cannot be used to distinguish positive from negative selection.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~An explanation prviously posited for an estimated union membership wage premium is measurement error. For example, if individuals who report covered nonmembership stuats are more likely to do so erroneously and some are actually not covered by a union contract, then the union membership premium is biased upward. Without independent verification of indivual responses in the CPS it is difficult to test this proposition directly.
328~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~An explanation prviously posited for an estimated union membership wage premium is measurement error. For example, if individuals who report covered nonmembership stuats are more likely to do so erroneously and some are actually not covered by a union contract, then the union membership premium is biased upward. Without independent verification of indivual responses in the CPS it is difficult to test this proposition directly.
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…CPS households are resurveyed for a seccond 4-month period after being omitted for 4 months so it is possible to match (some) individuals across 2 survey years, and researchers create a data set of 9,258 individuals in right-to-work states that, in the second interview, are employed full time in the private sector and are covered by a union ontract. In other words, of the 15, 995 observations used in tables 1-3, researchers are able to match 9,258 to the previous year's CPS information.
328~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~To analyze the effect of measurement error, researchers assume that consistent responses in both survey periods are less likely to be erroneous. Thus keeping only observations that reported the same employment status, industry, occupation, and union membership status in the 2 survey years yields 3,630 observations with an average log real wage of 2.608 and union membership rate of 94.35%. Recall that for the unmatched sample, the corresponding averages are 2.526 and 83.73%

328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The measurement error OLS log wage equation results are displayed in table 4.
328~D1~F17~Findings~Single vs. Separate Equation Membership Estimates~The single equation membership estimate is 0.065 (p-value = .006), while the implied estimate from the separate member and covered nonmember equations is 0.106. These are both smaller than the full sample estimates (0.114 and 0.136) but are still positive as well as statistically significant. Moreover, the results of table 3 sugested that OLS estimates are lower bounds, so table 4 implies that the lower bound of the union membership wage premium is 6.5% to 10%. 
328~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Measurement Error~If consistent responses in 2 successive survey removes the problem of measurement error, then measurement error cannot explain the estimated positive wage gain attributable to union membership.

328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~While a measure of tenure is not available in these data, researchers try two things to examine the importance of probationary periods and temporary workers for explaining a membership premium.
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~The CPS data files contain household identifiers, but not individual identifiers, so a matching algorithm is necessary. To match individuals, researchers created separate files of observations for each outgoing rotation group (survey month 4 or  8) by year and calendar month. Each month 8 file was then merged with its corresponding month 4 file by household identification number, state, sex, and race. Potential matches were discarded if the age or education variables differed by more than a year. This process was repeated four more times by collecting unmatched mnth 8 observations and remerging them with the month 4 observations. in the end, 993,197 observations were matched for a match rate of 67.8%. Restricting the sample to individuals working and covered by a union contract reduces the sample size to 82,698 and further restricting the sample to full-time private sector employees (in month 8) in right-to-work states reduces the sample size to 9,258.

328~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Tenure~While a measure of tenure is not available in these data, researchers try two things to examine the importance of probationary periods and temporary workers for explaining a membership premium.
328~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Tenure~…institutional features make it likely that covered nonmembers are more likely to have shorter tenures with their employers than union members.
328~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Tenure~First, in the matched data discussed in the previous section, it is likely that the individuals who provide consistent answers for employment status, industry, occupation, and union membership status have not changed jobs. Therefore, the individuals in that sample will have job tenure of at least 1 year, which is typically greater than the duration of probationary periods. Recall that a positive, statistically significant membership premium was estiamted in the CPS data. If this subsample is controlling for probationary periods then probationary periods do not remove the wage gain for union members.
328~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Tenure~Second, the April 1993 CPS Employee Benefits Supplement includes tenure with the present employer, so researchers create a sample of full-time, private sector employees covered by a union contract from this supplement.
328~D1~F18~Findings~Tenure Trends~…while the mean tenure for covered nonmembers (9.59 years in all states) is less than the union member mean (12.54 years), probationary periods are typically short (e.g., 30-90 days) and a mean of 9.59 years suggests that a significant number of covered nonmembers are not in probationary periods. In fact 85.3% of covered nonmembers report tenure greater than 1 year.
328~D1~F19~Findings~OLS Regression Estimation Results with Tenure Included~…adding tenure to an OLS log wage regression does not remove the union membership effect. Estimating the standard OLS log wage regression on the April 1993 sample yields a union membership coefficient of 0.088. Adding tenure to this regression yields a slightly reduced member coefficient of 0.073 (p-value = .001). Estimating separate equations for members and non members results in a log wage differential of 0.05. Using only right-to-work states, the sample size is only 745 (including only 123 covered nonmembers), but the union membership effect is still significant without tenure (0.090 with a p-value of 0.11) and with tenure (0.081 with a p-value of .018) included in the regression.

328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~While discrimination cannot be directly observed in these CPS data, labor law cases illustrate that it exists.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~While discrimination cannot be directly observed in these CPS data, labor law cases illustrate that it exists. For example, in Narragansett Restauarant Corp. 243 NLRB 126 (1979), Local 69 of the Hotel and restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union (illegally) had an agreement with the employer to pay nonmembers a lower wage and not make contributions to the vacation and welfare funds. Moreover, union discrimination against nonmembers need not be so explicit: in one example, an employee filed a grievance after being denied a promotion and the union (illegally) did not fully pursue the grievance because the grievant was not a member of the union (Machinists District 186 [Federal Mogul], 300 NLRB 669 [1990]). The promotion, which involved a 20% increse in the top wage rate, went to a union member. Union discrimination against nonmembers definitely exists.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~"Often overlooked in the academic literature, however, is the fact that employer discrimination against nonmbmers also exists. For example, in F&C Transfer Co., 277 NLRB 591 (1985), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that the employer (illegally) ""paid the contractual wage rate to and made pension and welfare contributions for all union members in the bargaining unit, but paid significantly less wages to and did not make contributions for the employees in the unit who were not members of the union."" In fact, a quick search of NLRB decisions revealed at lesat a dozen cases since 1980 of employer discrimination against nonmembers. thus, if one is willing to attribute some of the union age premium, it may the employer discrimination and not simply union discrimination."
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~The April 1993 CPS Supplement also contains information on firm and plant size, but including these variables in the regression does not affect the wage estimates.
328~D1~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The April 1993 CPS Supplement also contains information on firm and plant size, but including these variables in the regression does not affect the wage estimates.
328~D1~T2~Time Period~1993.0~…survey year from which the April CPS Employee Benefits Supplement was drawn.
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~…the 20% membership wage premium estimated for the construction industry may be suggestive of discrimination - or training. In construction, and longshoring, individuals covered by union contracts are likely to have been referred by a union hiring hall. Although exclusive hiring halls are supposed to be nondiscriminatory (Teamsters Local 357 v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 [1961]), the hiring hall potentially gives a union significantly more power to affect employment assignments and wages compared to other industries. 
328~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Union Membership Wage Premium~Employer discrimination is also present - perhaps due to the temporal or geographical nature of construction employment, many of the employer discrimination NLRB causes researchers found are in the construction industry (eg. F.J. Lieb Construction Co., 311 NLRB 810 [1993]). On the other hand, construction unions have a long history of providing training so perhaps, the large membership wage premium in construction stems from additional human capital of members.
328~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~This article utilizes data from the CPS Annual Earnings Files for 1983-93 to investigate the union membership wage premium for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in right-to-work states.
328~D1~V2~Variable~Union Dues~Union dues typically amount to 2 hours of wages per month, or roughly 1.25%, whereas the smallest membership premium, or free rider penalty, estimated in this article is 5%.

333~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…initial research on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) appeared to provide consistent evidence of a general increase in the rate of job changing. Because employers in the PSID are not uniquely identified, a job change must be inferred using several different question about length of tenure that have changed over the years.
333~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men~The measurement problem in the PSID that a job change must be inferred using several different questions about length of tenure that have changed over the years does not plague the other main source of longitudinal data, the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS), which provides unique employer identification codes that are consistent over time.

333~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~The NLS cohorts are followed from their late-teens to their mid-30s, when roughly two-thirds of life-time job changes and wage growth occur and when long-term relationships with employers are established. This is particularly useful because the two NLS cohorts bracket the striking growth in earnings inequality that emerged in the 1980s. The first cohort is tracked from 1966, the second cohort from 1979 to 1994. Comparing the two thus provides an opportunity to explore whether there have been changes in job instability and whether they have contributed to the growth in earnings inequality.

In part, they seek to subject the Monks and Pizer (1998) findings to closer scrutiny, as the history of this field suggests that differences in measurement and methods can lead to different conclusions. Monks and Pizer made a number of analytic choices that the current researchers found questionable: they did not consistently use the employer codes provided by the NLS, they did not choose an equivalent set of years for each cohort nore use the full range of years available, and they restricted their sample to full-time workers. Researchers address these measurement issues in the analysis.

333~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~As the potential bias associated with permanent attrition is always a key problem for longitudinal data, researchers also conduct an extensive attrition analysis.

333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Separation Rate~...the focus of the field has so far been on identifying a general trend in instability for all workers, and this is where the controversy resides. But researchers also have evidence that specific groups in the labor market - less-educated workers, black workers, and older men with long tenures - may in fact have experienced an increase in instability, though the results differ by whether the 1990s are included in the analysis and by whether the analysis is restricted to involuntary job loss. 
333~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~…regardless of whether or not job instability is on the rise, it is important to ask whether the wage outcomes associated with leaving or not leaving an employer have changed. Only a few researchers have addressed this question, because resolving data and measurement problems has dominated so much of the effort. As these problems are resolved, however, wage outcomes should increasingly become the focus of study, since wages help to inform us about the welfare consequences of instability. Researchers therefore test for cohort differences in the wage gains that young workers capture as they engate in job shopping and then eventually settle with one employer.
333~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~Researchers use two data sets from the NLS. Both provide nationally representative samples of young men aged 14-22 in the first survey year, who are then tracked for 16 years until they are aged 30-38.

333~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Attrition Rate Amongst the Original vs. the Recent Cohort~The attrition rate is considerably higher for the original cohort than for the recent cohort (25.8% vs. 7.8%). This discrepancy is primarily due to differences in retention rules in the two panels. In the original cohort, any respondent who missed two consecutive interviews was dropped from the survey, while such respondents in the recent cohort remained eligible and were pursued for future interviews with great effort.

333~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Employer Identification Codes~…these employer codes are the best source of employer identification, not only for the NLS data but also compared to the other longitudinal data sets.
333~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Employer Identification Codes~"Researchers use the employer codes for both cohorts. Researchers focus on the respondent's main ""CPS"" employer at the time of the survey. In the original cohort, the CPS employer is assigned an employer code that is unique across all interview years. In the recent cohort, unique identification of the CPS employer is only possible between any two consecutive years. By successively linking pairs of years, however, researchers can trace a unique CPS employer over any time span as long as that employer is present in each year. Researchers have restricted their use of the employer codes in the original cohort to match this constraint."
333~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Employer Identification Codes~The CPS employer is identified in the same way across both cohorts in all survey years: if the respondent held more than one job at the time of the survey, he is asked to focus on the one at which he worked the most hours. The exclusive focus on the CPS employer is important to ensure comparability across cohorts, since for the recent cohort information is gathered on up to five jobs every year.
333~D2~T1~Time Period~1966-1981~Four noncontiguous years were skipped in the original cohort follow-up surveys including 1972, 1974, 1977, and 1979.
333~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~2-year Employer Comparisons~Four noncontiguous years were skipped in the original cohort follow-up surveys. This means that researchers cannot construct an unbroken series of year-to-year employer comparisons. Researchers therefore construct a series of 2-year employer comparisons. These are strictly matched between the two surveys, so that researchers are comparing job chnges at exactly the same ages and at exactly the same time during the survey period. There are six such comparisons for each cohort, and they are evenly spaced across the survey time span.

333~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Job Separation~Researchers define a job separation as follows. For each 2-year comparison, the risk set in year t is all employe respondents, not self-employed or working without pay, who are also observed in year t + 2. If the respondent is unemployed or out of the labor force in year t +2, an employer separation occurred. If the respondent is employed in year t + 2, then the employer code for the CPS employer in year t is compared to the CPS employer code in year t + 2. An employer separation occurred if these codes differ.
333~DV2~L3~Variable Value~2-year Separation Rate~The empirical 2-year separation rate is calculated as the number of respondents who have left their year t employer by year t + 2, divided by the total number of respondents in the risk set in year t.

333~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~The second dependent variable, wage, is measured as the respondent's hourly wage at his CPS job at the date of interview. This measure is constructed by the NLS: from direct information if the respondent reported their earnings as an hourly wage and from questions on the weeks (or months) and hours worked in the last year if the respondent reported in other units.
333~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~Researchers focus on hourly wages rather than yearly earnings because the latter are confounded by hours and weeks worked and the number of jobs held during the year.
333~D1, D2~V4~Variable~Earnings~...the hourly wage is computed from questions on the weeks (or months) and hours worked in the last year if the respondents reported earnings in other units than their direct hourly wage.
333~D1, D2~V5~Variable~Weeks Worked~...the hourly wage is computed from questions on the weeks (or months) and hours worked in the last year if the respondents reported earnings in other units than their direct hourly wage.

333~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~Hourly Wages~Cleaning and imputation of missing wages affected less than 6% of person-year wage observations in each cohort.
333~D1, D2~DV4~Derived variable~2-year Wage Changes~In Section V, researchers examine the 2-year wage changes that correspond to the 2-year job changes for the subset of respondents in the risk set who were working in both year. Thus, for any two years t and t+2 that were used to compute whether or not a job change occured, researchers compute the corresponding wage change: (ln)wage(t+2) - (ln)wage(t).
333~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Total Wage Growth~Researchers also compute the total wage growth that each individual experienced over the entire 16-year survey period. Total wage growth is measured by specifying a model for the individual-specific permanent wage profile over the 16 years, smoothed of short-term, transitory fluctuations. Specifically, the smoothed wages are predicted hourly wages for each respondent at each age, from a mixed-effects wage model that allows a unique wage profile for each person across his work history. Technical details of the model can be found in Bernhardt et al. (1997).

All the covariates are measured identically in the two cohorts and all are time varying; this is, they are measured at year t for any year t versus t+2 employer or wage comparisons. While most of these variables are straight forward - see the NLS Users' Guide for details on coding - several require elaboration.

333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV7~Variable~Work Experience~Work experience is not measured with potential experience rather with cumulative actual months worked since age 16. For respondents who entered the survey after age 16, researchers imputed the missing months of experience using a model based on observed experience for those who entered the survey before age 17. For any years in the remainder of the survey where data on months worked was missing, researchers imputed the average of the months worked in the surrounding 2 years.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Education~…education is measured using information on both years of education completed and degree received. Thus respondents coded as high school graduates or college graduates must actually hold those degrees (a GED is considered equivalent to a high school degree in this coding.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Education~The reader may notice that educational attainment is actually lower in the recent cohort. The CPS data also show that educational attainment among men graduation from high school in the late 1970s and early 1980s fell, likely in response to the end of the Vietnam War draft.
333~D1, D2~F2~Findings~2-year Job-Separation Rate for the Original vs. the Recent Cohort~Without any adjustment, the empirical 2-year job-separation rate differs significantly between the two cohorts: .464 for the original cohort as compared to .527 for the recent cohort. This represents a 13.6% proportionate increase in the rate of job changing among young white men in recent years. This aggregate difference does not account for the very substantial shifts in job instability that occur as young workers get older, attain education, and accumulate longer tenures, nor for compositional differences on those dimensions.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~In modeling the separation rates to determine whether there has been a secular increase in the rate of job changing, researchers specify a logistic regression model where Y(ijt) indicates whether individual I in job j in year t has left that job by year t + 2, P[Y(ijt) = 1 | X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), C(i), [phi](i)] is the probability that an individual in job j in year t has left that job by year t + 2 given that they have characteristics X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), C(i), and [phi](i), described below, and logit (p) = log(p/(1-p)) is the log-odds of the probability p. Here X(ijt) represents time-varying characteristics of the respondent, J(ijt) represents time-varying characteristics of the job, including tenure, U(it) represents the local unemployment rate in the individual's labor market in year t, and C(i) represents a cohort indicator variable, coded zero for the original cohort, one for the recent cohort. Researchers include an individual-specific effect (ISE), [phi](i), to capture unmeasured characteristics of the individual that are stable over the sample period. Since the main objective of this term is to reflect the longitudinal nature of the sample, researchers adopt a simple specification, modeling it as independent of the other regressors. The estimate of the cohort difference was robust to this, and other, specifications of unobserved heterogeneity.
333~DV1~L1~Variable Value~Job Separation~…Y(ijt) indicates whether individual (i) in job j in year t has left that job by year t + 2.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Probability of Job Separation~…P[Y(ijt) = 1 | X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), C(i), [phi](i)] is the probability that an individual in job j in year t has left that job by year t + 2 given that they have characteristics X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), C(i), and [phi](i), described below, and logit (p) = log(p/(1-p)) is the log-odds of the probability p.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Log-Odds of the Separation Probability~…P[Y(ijt) = 1 | X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), C(i), [phi](i)] is the probability that an individual in job j in year t has left that job by year t + 2 given that they have characteristics X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), C(i), and [phi](i), described below, and logit (p) = log(p/(1-p)) is the log-odds of the probability p.
333~D1, D2~DV10~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Characteristics of the Respondent~…X(ijt) represents time-varying characteristics of the respondent.
333~D1, D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Time-Varying Characteristics of the Job~…J(ijt) represents time-varying characteristics of the job, including tenure.
333~D1, D2, D4~V11~Variable~Local Unemployment Rate~…U(it) represents the local unemployment rate in the individual's labor market in year t.
333~D1, D2~V12~Variable~Cohort Indicator~…C(i) represents a cohort indicator variable, coded zero for the original cohort, one for the recent cohort.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Individual-Specific Effect~…researchers include an individual-specific effect (ISE), [phi](i), to capture unmeasured characteristics of the individual that are stable over the sample period. Since the main objective of this term is to reflect the longitudinal nature of the sample, researchers adopt a simple specification, modeling it as independent of the other regressors.
333~D1~V13~Variable~Job End Date~For the original cohort, end dates for jobs are impossible to recover consistently for all year. This induces a form of censoring, i.e., interval censoring with variable interval widths, which complicates the usual duration models, so researchers do not consider them here.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~"Table 1 presents the results of several versions of the above model. In model 1, researchers control for basic compositional differences. For example, researchers know that the distributions of age, education, and local unemployment differ across the two cohorts. Controlling for work experience is also important - recall that the Vietnam veterans delayed their entry into the labor market reaching employment stability at a later age and thus ""dragging down"" the overall stability of the original cohort."
333~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Correction Variable Behavior~"The behavior of the ""correction"" variables is as expected. The odds of a job change strongly decline with age, tenure, and accumulated work experience, as young workers begin to form permanent attachments to employer. Higher local unemployment has a mild positive effect on the odds of a job change. And youth without a high school degree are significantly more likely to leave their current employer than are high school graduates, while those with postsecondary education are significantly less likely to do so. In sum, after adjusting for key compositional differences, researchers estimate that the odds of a job change are 43% higher for the recen cohort. Researchers consider this their best baseline estimate of the increase in job instability experienced by young white men in the 1980s and early 1990s, as compared to their counterparts in the late 1960s and 1970s."
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~In the next four models (following the baseline model), researchers explore several alternative specifications in order to pursue different substantive questions. In model 2, researchers examine the impact of additional sociodemographic variables. In model 3, researchers ask whether the economywide shift toward the service sector has played a role. In model 4, researchers fit an interaction between the cohort effect and the industry effect. The cohort dummy now captures the cohort difference in job instability within the baseline industries of retail and wholesale trade and business services. Finally, researchers exaimed whether the greater instability observed in the recent cohort is simply a function of more volatile transitions to the labor market - it could be that the cohort differences in job stability are less pronounced after this transition has been completed. In model 5, researchers therefore reestimated model 1, but only for workers after they have finished their schooling.
333~V8~L2~Variable Value~Service~Service industries as a rule are more unstable than the public sector and the goods-producing and traditionally unionized industries. On both fronts, the young workers in the recent cohort are disadvantaged. Mirroring the economywide trend, they are less likely to be employed in the public sector, and more likely to be employed in the service sector, especially low-end, high-turnover industries such as retail trade and business services.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~In the first three models, all of the variables are constrained to have the same effect for both cohorts, so that researchers are capturing the impact of compositional shifts in the variables, not changes in their impact.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~Researchers did test whether the rise in job instability for the recent cohort was particularly pronounced for those with less education. Surprisingly, researchers found no such differential - the rise in instability has been felt by all education groups. 
333~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Sociodemographic Variable and the Odds of a Job Change~…when examining the impact of additional sociodemographic variables, it is found that the enrollment in school raises the odds of a job change, not surprising since jobs held during schooling are often short-lived. The geographic effect of living in the South works in the expected direction, as does the stabilizing effect of marriage. The impact of these three variables on the cohort difference is strong: the odds of a job change are now 28% higher for the recent cohort - still substantial, but clearly lower. Most of this reduction is driven by lower marriage rates in the recent cohort and its longer periods of college enrollment; both trends are evident in CPS data as well.
333~D1, D2~V14~Variable~Currently Enrolled~…a dichotomous variable indicating enrollment in school in the survey year t.
333~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Living in South~…a regional residence indicator used to estimate the geographic effect of living in the south on job separation rates.
333~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Married~…a marital status indicator used to estimate the stabilizing effect of marriage on job separation rates.
333~V8~L2~Variable Value~Service~In model 3, researchers ask whether the economywide shift toward the service sector has played a role.
333~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Compositional Shifts and Job Change Odds~Controlling for compositional shifts in model 3 further reduces the cohort difference, so that the job-change odds are now 19% higher for the recent cohort, about half of the baseline estimate.
333~D1, D2, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Cohort, Industry~In model 4, researchers fit an interaction between the cohort effect and the industry effect. The cohort dummy now captures the cohort difference in job instability within the baseline industries of retail and wholesale trade and business services.
333~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Cohort Differences and Industry Trends~"In model 4, the first interaction term indicates that the cohort difference is similar within finance, insurance, and real estate and professional services. The second interaction term, however, shows a significantly stronger cohort differences in industries that historicaly have been unionized. Thus not only are youth in the recent cohort suffering from greater reliance on the ""unstable"" service sector, but they are also not benefiting as much when they are employed in traditionally stable industries such as manufacturing. What researchers are very likely identifying here, albeit indirectly, is the shedding of employment and declines in unionization in the goods-producing and, to some extent, public sectors."
333~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Job Instability and the Settling Down of Cohorts~"The model 5 results are consistent with those from the full sample, and in particular, the estimated cohort difference remains strong and significant (the same finding obtains if researchers reestimate models 2-4). Thus the increased job instability researchers have found does not disappear once the young workers ""settle down"" and is therefore not just a legacyof churning in the labor market early on."
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~At a general level, the current researchers' findings match those of Monks and Pizer (1998) in that both papers find greater job instability for the recent cohort. A direct side-by-side comparison of results is not possible: researchers use different (as well as more) years in their analysis, construct a somewhat different measure of job change, fit different models, and focus on a different sample. A reasonable approximation of their analysis, however, can be obtained if researchers restrict their sample to full-time workers only and fit a version of model 1 using a continuous linear time trend instead of a cohort dummy and including only education, age, marital status, and the unemployment rate as covariates.
333~D1, D2~V17~Variable~Continuous Linear Trend~…a continuous linear time trend as a substitute for a cohort dummy.
333~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Current Results vs. Monks and Pizer's~…in the altered model, with reasonable comparability to Monks and Pizer's (1998), the time trend for whites is found to be 0.022 (SE 0.005), within 1.2 standard errors of Monks and Pizer's estimate of 0.017 (SE 0.006). Thus there is solid agreement between the two studies to this point.

333~V8~L6~Variable Value~Public Administration~…one of four industries of interest in the current research.

333~DV13~L8~Variable Value~Recent Cohort in Traditional Industries~…a cohort, industry interaction value of interest in the current research.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Individual-Specific Effect~Researchers model the [phi](i) as conditionally independent given the other regressors with a mean zero Gaussian distribution. This is a generalized linear mixed-effects model that researchers fit by maximum likelihood.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~There are many alternative specifications that can be used to examine robustness. The fixed ISE specification is infeasible, as researchers have a maximum of six observations per individual, while the conditional maximum likelihood estimator does not identify the coefficients of time-invariant factors. Researchers relaxed the assumption of independence by specifying a correlation between the ISE, tenure, and education. Researchers also fitted a population-average logistic model using generalized estimating equations instead of the ISE model. in neither case was the cohort effect appreciably changed.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Tenure~If researchers estimate model 1 without tenure, the recent cohort has even higher odds of job change, reflecting the fact that tenure is endogenous in the current model. There is no simple solution to this problem; excluding tenure altogether results in a serious misspecification, so researchers have decided to take the conservative route of including it.
333~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…one might expect the NLS data to yield different findings, because they focus on young adult men only, they extend from the late 1960s to the early 1990s and thus capture a longer time span, and they allow for a direct, clean measure of instability. On the other hand it may be the case that other characteristics of the NLS data are generating an artificial increase in instability, in particular the higher attrition rate in the original cohort (25.8% vs. 7.8% in the recent cohort). If respondents lost to follow-up are also more likely to be unstable in their job change behavior, then the cohort effect for job instability may be upwardly biased by the lower rates of attrition in the recent cohort.
333~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men~…one might expect the NLS data to yield different findings, because they focus on young adult men only, they extend from the late 1960s to the early 1990s and thus capture a longer time span, and they allow for a direct, clean measure of instability. On the other hand it may be the case that other characteristics of the NLS data are generating an artificial increase in instability, in particular the higher attrition rate in the original cohort (25.8% vs. 7.8% in the recent cohort). If respondents lost to follow-up are also more likely to be unstable in their job change behavior, then the cohort effect for job instability may be upwardly biased by the lower rates of attrition in the recent cohort.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~V10~Variable~Education~In model 5, researchers include observations from individuals only after they are never enrolled in school again and their education level never increases again.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~Monks and Pizer estimated a probit model, while the current researchers estimated a logit model (both were fit with independent random effects). Probit and logit estimates are generally comparable, unless the probabilities being modeled are very low or very higher. This is not the case here, as the majority of the probabilities of a job change are within the .3-.6 range.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~Researchers use two strategies to examine the potential confounding effect of attrition. First, researchers benchmark the NLS job-change estimates against estimates based on the PSID and the CPS. This as in exercise that is also important in its own right, as it contributes to cross-data-set validation in the field. Second, researchers develop several model-based adjustments to their instability estimtes for the impact of attrition.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~Researchers begin by comparing job change estimates from the NLS to estimates from Polsky's (1999) series for the PSID and Stewart's (1998) series for the CPS; both address some of the well-known problems with changes in measures and question wording over time. If attrition in the original cohort introduces bias, then the job instability estimates from the original cohort will not match up well with the other data sets, while estimates from the recent cohort will match up well (since attrition in the recent cohort was negligible).
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~Two factors complicate a simple comparison. First, neither the PSID nor the CPS extend back far enough in time, so they provide only two time points that researchers can use to compare with the original cohort. Both of these years, however, fall toward the end of the series when the greater attrition rate int he original cohort is most likely to make itself felt. Second, the two NLS cohorts age throughout the 16-year survey period and the skipped interview years in the origjnal cohort mean that researchers sometimes have to use 2-year instead of 1-year job change rates. With these considerations in mind, table 2 presents the best comparisons that can be constructed showing the specific age ranges and years used in each case. For all three data sets, the samples are white working men who are not self-employed.
333~D3~D3~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…neither the PSID nor the CPS extend back far enough in time, so they provide only two time points that researchers can use to compare with the original cohort. Both of these years, however, fall toward the end of the series when the greater attrition rate in the original cohort is most likely to make itself felt.
333~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…neither the PSID nor the CPS extend back far enough in time, so they provide only two time points that researchers can use to compare with the original cohort. Both of these years, however, fall toward the end of the series when the greater attrition rate in the original cohort is most likely to make itself felt.
333~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…the two NLS cohorts age throughout the 16-year survey period, and the skipped interview years in the original cohrot mean that researchers sometimes have to use 2-year instead of 1-year job change rates.
333~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men~…the two NLS cohorts age throughout the 16-year survey period, and the skipped interview years in the original cohrot mean that researchers sometimes have to use 2-year instead of 1-year job change rates.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Separation Rate~The first half of table 2 gives the NLS/PSID comparison, using either one-year or two-year job change rates. For the NLS, these rates are once again calculated using the unique employer codes; for the PSID, these rates are calculated using information on job tenure. For both, the measure is the proportion of respondents working at time t who had left their time t employer at time t + 1 or t + 2, depending on which comparison is being made.
333~D1, D2, D3~F9~Findings~NLS/PSID Comparisons~For the NLS/PSID comparisons, the two sets of estimates match up remarkably well; none of the differences is statistically significant. Note in particular the close agreement in 1980 for the original cohort, the next to last year of that panel when the rate of attrition peaks. This is a solid indicator that the greater attrition rate in the original cohort is not driving the current finding of changes in job stability over time.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Separation Rate~The second half of the table show the comparison of the NLS with the CPS. This comparison is more problematic because the two data sets have different measures and risk sets.
333~DV2~L9~Variable Value~14.5-month Separation Rate~…the CPS measure is (1) a 14.5-month job-change rate that (2) is inferred using several decision rules for (3) respondents who worked at least 1 week in the previous year and who were not students or graduates.
333~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS measure is (1) a 14.5-month job-change rate that (2) is inferred using several decision rules for (3) respondents who worked at least 1 week in the previous year and who were not students or graduates.
333~DV2~L10~Variable Value~1-year Separation Rate~…the NLS measure is (1) a 1-year job-change rate that (2) is calculated directly for (3) respondents who were working during the week of the previous year's survey.
333~D1, D2, D4~F10~Findings~NLS/CPS Comparisons~The results of comparing across different job-change measures in the CPS and the NLS. The size and significance of the differences vary, even within the recent cohort that has very little attrition. The sense is that it would be difficult to reconcile these two data sets without considerably more analysis.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~"The second attrition analysis is a model-based sensitivity analysis. Specifically, researchers make several adjustments to their estimate of the cohort difference in job stability, based on potential differences in the behavior of survey drop outs (hereinafter ""attriters""). First, attriters may have higher levels of job instability than respondents who continue to be interviewed (hereinafter ""non-attriters""). Second, attriters may also be less likely to be eligible for the risk set that defines the job change sample. in both cases, attriters do not contribute enough ""unstable"" observations to the original cohort sample, and as a results the cohort effect is overstated."
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~"The researchers strategy in calculating the adjusted cohort effects, therefore, is to effectively ""add back in"" the missing attriter observations. Since researchers are conducting a hypothetical experiment - ""What would the cohort effect have been if the survey dropouts had not dropped out?"" - researchers cannot estimate the adjusted cohort effect empirically from the data. instead, researchers derive an expression for this adjustment effect that allows the (1) incorporation of any greater propensity among attriters to change jobs, and (2) equalize the number of observations contributed by attriters and non-attriters."
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~…in estimating the adjusted cohort effect, researchers begin by adding several terms to model 1 in Section III. The model now includes two attrition-related terms: A(ijt), a dummy variable indicating whether person (i) in job j in year t is lost to follow-up after t + 2 given that he has not been lost before, and CA(ijt), the interaction between attrition and cohort. Thus [theta](4) represents the attrition effect for the original cohort. (Below researchers will suppress the references to the characteristics X(ijt), J(ijt), U(it), and [phi](i).). Under this model, the log-odds of a 2-year job change for a randomly chosen person-year with given characteristics from cohort k is given from a logit regression. The attrition-adjusted cohort effect is then simply represented as a first difference between the log-odds of a 2-year job change when C(i) = 1 and C(i) = 0.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~The attrition-adjusted cohort effect is simply represented as a first difference between the log-odds of a 2-year job change when C(i) = 1 and C(i) = 0. The first term ([theta](3)) represents the cohort effect for a non-attriter. The second term represents the differential odds that an attriter experiences a job separation before being lost, multiplied by the difference in attrition rates between teh two cohrots. If attriters are more unstable, [theta](4) will be positive, and as the difference in attrition rates is negative, the adjustment will lower the estimate of the cohort effect. The third term represents the differential in the attrition effect for the recent cohort, mulitplied by the attrition rate in the recent cohort. If those who drop out in the recent cohorts are more unstable than those who drop out in the original cohort, then [theta](5) will be positive and this adjustment will increase the estimate of the cohort effect.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Non-Attriter Cohort Effect~…[theta](3) represents the cohort effect for a non-attriter.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Differential Odds of Job Separation, Difference in Attrition Rates~…this term represnts the differential odds that an attriter experiences a job separation before being lost, multiplied by the difference in attrition rates between the cohorts. If attriters are more unstable, [theta](4) will be positive, and as the difference in attrition rates is negative, the adjustment will lower the estimate of the cohort effect.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV18~Derived Variable~Differential in the Attrition Effect, Attrition Rate~…this term represents the differential in the attrition effect for the recent cohort, multiplied by the attrition rate in the recent cohort. If those who drop out in the recent cohort are more unstable than those who drop out in the original cohort, then [theta](5) will be positive and this adjustment will increase the estimate of the cohort effect.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~In order to calculate an adjusted cohort effect based on this derivation, researchers need to estimate two sets of quantities: [theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5); and the conditional probabilities of attrition.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV19~Derived Variable~Conditional Probabilities of Attrition~In order to calculate an adjusted cohort effect based on this derivation, researchers need to estimate two sets of quantities: [theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5); and the conditional probabilities of attrition.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Non-Attriter Cohort Effect~In order to calculate an adjusted cohort effect based on this derivation, researchers need to estimate two sets of quantities: [theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5); and the conditional probabilities of attrition.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~Differential Odds of Job Separation, Difference in Attrition Rates~In order to calculate an adjusted cohort effect based on this derivation, researchers need to estimate two sets of quantities: [theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5); and the conditional probabilities of attrition.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV18~Derived Variable~Differential in the Attrition Effect, Attrition Rate~In order to calculate an adjusted cohort effect based on this derivation, researchers need to estimate two sets of quantities: [theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5); and the conditional probabilities of attrition.
333~D1, D2~F11~Findings~[theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5) Estimates~Researchers estimate the [theta](3-5) variables using the modified logistic regression model from above and obtained [theta](3) = 0.3478, [theta](4) = 0.2902, [theta](5) = 0.0039. Note that attriters in the recent cohort are in fact relatively more unstable than attriters in the original cohort. Researchers might expect this, since recent cohort was pursued more rigorously for continued participation in the survey - any respondent who still managed to drop out of the survey are thus likely to be particularly unstable individuals.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV19~Derived Variable~Conditional Probabilities of Attrition~Researchers estimated the conditional probabilities of attrition that they will use in their derivation. The idea here is to construct these probabilities as though the attriters' unobserved years had been included in the analysis. Researchers accomplish this by defining the fraction of attriters at the level of the individual rater than at the level of person-years, so that the number of person-year observations contributed by attriters and non-attriters is equalized. There are three ways these fractions can be defined.
333~DV19~L11~Variable Value~The Fraction of Attriters in the Risk Set~The fraction of respondents in the job-change risk set who eventually drop out of the survey is 0.1603 in the original cohort and 0.0545 in the recent cohort. In using these fractions, researchers are effectively adding the person years that attriters would have contributed had they not dropped out of the sample.
333~DV19~L12~Variable Value~The Fraction of Attriters in the Risk Set, Equalized for Eligibility~In addition to the adjustment made in (1), researchers also need to account for the fact that recent cohort attriters were mor likely to make it into the job-change risk set than original cohort attriters. Researchers do so by equalizing the proportion of attriters eligible for the risk set, yielding an adjusted attrition fraction of 0.1966 for the original cohort.
333~DV19~L13~Variable Value~The Fraction of Attriters in the Full Sample~Finally, the strongest adjustment would use the fraction of attriters for each cohort in the full sample (all available survey years). The fraction of persons who ever worked in the full sample and who are lost to attrition is 0.2323 in the original cohort and 0.0658 in the recent cohort.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV14~Derived Variable~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~The adjustments based on each of the three conditional probability methods is provided in table 3, along with the unadjusted estimate from model 1 in table 1 for comparison.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~F12~Findings~Attrition-Adjusted Cohort Effect~While in all cases the attrition adjustment reduces the estimated cohort effect is 0.3172, an 11.31% decrease in the unadjusted value. Under method 2, the adjusted cohort effect is 0.3058, a 14.50% decrease in the unadjusted value. Finally, under method 3 the adjusted cohort effect is 0.2296, a 16.23% decrease. Even with this most conservative adjustment, however, the recent cohort still has a 35% higher odds of a job change.
333~DV19~L12~Variable Value~The Fraction of Attriters in the Risk Set~Researchers consider this the most accurate adjustment, since it removes both types of attrition bias from the job-change sample.
333~DV19~L13~Variable Value~The Fraction of Attriters in the Full Sample~Researchers feel less comfortable with this adjustment, since it uses estimates from the job-change sample (i.e., [theta](3), [theta](4), and [theta](5)) and applies them to a sample that is not included in the instability analysis conducted in this article. 
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~F13~Findings~Cross-Data-Set Comparisons and Model-Based Adjustments~In sum, both the cross-data-set comparisons and the model-based adjustments suggest that while a slight attrition bias does exist in the original cohort, it does not alter the statistical significance or the substance of the findings of the current research.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Separation Rate~A rise in job instability among young adults in the American labor market does not necessarily signal a problem. In fact, a solid body of research has estabilished that job shopping early in the career is highly beneficial, yielding greater wage gains than staying put with one employer.
333~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~2-year Wage Changes~...a solid body of research has estabilished that job shopping early in the career is highly beneficial, yielding greater wage gains than staying put with one employer. Roughly two-thirds of lifetime wage growth for male high school graduates occurs during the first 10 years of labor market experience and the bulk of it is the result of job changes. While it is in general true that having many employers early on does not impede wage growth, in the longer term, job instability becomes harful to wage growth, and chronically high levels of job instability are detrimental from the outset. In this context, it is important to examine how the wage returns to job shopping have changed for the recent cohort.
333~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~…researchers continue with the sample used in the job-change analysis, but select that subset of respondents who were working in both years t and t + 2, so that researchers can construct the corresponding 2-year wage cahnges.
333~D2~D2~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men~…researchers continue with the sample used in the job-change analysis, but select that subset of respondents who were working in both years t and t + 2, so that researchers can construct the corresponding 2-year wage cahnges.
333~D1, D2~DV4~Derived Variable~2-year Wage Changes~…researchers continue with the sample used in the job-change analysis, but select that subset of respondents who were working in both years t and t + 2, so that researchers can construct the corresponding 2-year wage cahnges.
333~D1, D2~DV20~Derived Variable~Median Wage Changes~In the top half of figure 1, researchers have plotted median wage changes for workers who left their employer and for workers who stayed with the same employer.
333~D1, D2~F14~Findings~Job Changes and Hourly Wages in the SR and the LR ~Figure 1 confirms that early in the career, job changing pays off more than staying with an employer - in fact, these wage gains are substantially higher than any experienced later on. After the mid-20s, there is less to be gained from switching employers, and wage growth as a whole slows down. The recent cohort, however, has failed to capture wage growth precisely where it is most critical, in the early stages of job shopping. This deterioration first appears between the ages of 16 and 21. Breakdowns by education show that it is younbg workers moving directly from high school into the labor market who recieve the lowest returns. There is also a noticeable drop in the wage gains resulting from a job change in the early 30s, and this is shared by all except those with a college degree. By contrast, when young workers stay with the same employer, there is little difference in the absolute wage gains captured by the two cohorts. In relative terms, though, the recent cohort benefits more from staying with same employer after the mid-20s, because the returns to job changing have declined so steeply at that point. In these graphs statistical significance effectively ends up being a function of sample size. So, e.g., in the job change panel, the gap in the early age ranges is statistically significant, while the gap among 31-33-year-olds is not - by the later ages, a much smaller proportion of the samples is changing jobs.
333~DV1~L14~Variable Value~Employer-to-Employer~"…in section IV, researchers focus only on ""employer-to-employer"" changes, in contrast to the measure used in Sec. III, which includes unemployment and out-of-labor-force as a destination state. Refitting the models in Sec. III for ""employer-to-employer"" subset, however, yields very similar results in terms of the cohort differential in instability."
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~~In table 4, researchers further explore the role of education in these trends, with a model of cohort differences in the wage returns to changing and not changing jobs (again, this regression is simply descriptive). Substantive findings are summarized in the third column.
333~D1, D2~DV21~Derived Variable~Educational Differentials in Wage Returns~In table 4, researchers further explore the role of education in these trends, with a model of cohort differences in the wage returns to changing and not changing jobs (again, this regression is simply descriptive).
333~D1, D2~F15~Findings~Educational Differentials in Wage Returns for the Original Cohort vs. the Recent Cohort~For the original cohort, the education differentials in wage returns are roughly similar regardless of whether one changes jobs or not. This is not the case for the recent cohort. Here, young adults wihtout any college experience are getting hit the hardest when they engage in job search - just as job changing has become more prevalent. by contras, those with college experience in the recent cohort have maintained their wage growth when they engage in job search.
333~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Transitory Wage Variance~A second potential impact of job instability is on the variability in wage changes. There has been some debate over the role of transitory wage fluctuations in the overall growth in wage dispersion over the last 2 decades. The rise in job instability would seem a natural candidate for explaining an increase in transitory wage variance.
333~D1, D2~DV22~Derived Variable~Transitory Wage Variance~In the bottom half of figure 1, researchers have plotted the variances of the observed wage changes. 
333~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Job Change and Transitory Wage Variance for the Original Cohort vs. the Recent Cohort~Generally speaking, a job change results in more variable wage changes, as one might expect. The recent cohort, however, consistently shows greater variability in wage gains. This is especially pronounced among job changers in the later age ranges, yet it is also evident among stayers at all ages. This suggests that transitory wage fluctuations associated with job changes are not the only force driving the increase in wage dispersion. Breakdowns by education show consistency in these trends across all education groups.
333~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Logit~"As a check on the wage differential findings, researchers fit the same model using ""permanent"" wages that have been smoothed of short-term variability. The results were quite similar, with the obvious difference that a substantially greater proportion of the variance was explained using the smoothed wages."
333~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~Total Wage Growth~"The young adult workers observed here have experienced an entire chain of wage changes. Even small differences in single wage changes can cumulate into substantial differences over time. Figure 2 plots the distribution of total wage growth between the ages of 16 and 36, using ""permanent"" wages that have short-term fluctuations smoothed out."
333~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Smoothed Wages~"…""permanent"" wages that have short-term fluctuations smoothed out."
333~D1, D2~F17~Findings~Figure 2 Trends~Two important trends emerge from the figure regarding the distribution of total wage growth. First, young workers who entered the labor force in the 1980s experienced significantly lower total wage growth when compared to their predecessors. Translated into real terms, the typical workers in the original cohort saw this hourly wage increase by $8.65 between the ages of 16 and 36, compared to $6.69 for those in the recent cohort, a 23% decline (both figures in 1992 dollars). Not surprisingly, this loss of growth has been fgelt largely by those without a 4-year college degree. Second, long-term wage growth has also become significantly more unequal in the recent cohort. There remain some workers who experience high levels of wage growth, but there are now substantially more workers who have minimal or even negative wage growth. Researchers estimate that the percent of workers experiencing no wage growth or actual real wage declines is 1.7% for the original cohort but 7.2% for the recent cohort. This polarization becomes progressively stronger as the young workers age and is consistent across different levels of education. Figure 2 suggests that there is a connection between trends in job instability and wage inequality, since it mirrors the findings on the wage consequences of job changing.

334~334:  Trends in Labor Force Transitions of Older Men and Women~~~~
334~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…researchers use the matched and unmatched March Current Population Survey to describe what they believe to be the most salient features regarding the labor force behavior of men and women aged 49 and over during the last 2 decades. The primary interest is in summarizing data over a relatively long period to question the conventional wisdom regarding causes of declining retirment age and provide the stylized facts with whichfuture research must contend.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the matched CPS is a little used but very rich source of information on dynamic labor force behavior and consists of a long sequence of short panels constructed by matching individual records across adjacent-year files of the March CPS. The use of these data is one of the novelties of this article. Unlike earlier studies, researchers are in the unique position of being able to analyze participation and labor force transitions over a long period of time and for many birth cohorts. Researchers concentrate equally on men and women, although they abstract from the difficult problem of how decisions.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…defined as weeks employed out of 52.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…the data begins in 1968 when male participation rates appear to be at a post-World War II high, Since then, male participation (defined as weeks employed out of 52) has fallen at all aged, but most abruptly for men aged 62 to 65. In 1968, participation was 91.5% at age 50, 83.8% at age 60, 58.4% at age 65, and 28.5% at age 69. During the next 20 years, the participation rate fell by about 4 to 5 percenage points for men aged 50, and the drop was progressively larger for older men up through age 64. For men aged 60, the 1968-89 drop in participation was 15.8 percentage points, and it was 30.5 percentage points (to a level of 36.6^) for men 64 years old. For men aged 67-69, participation rates by the end of the data were roughly 12 percentage points lower than at the beginning.

334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…for women, the 1968 and 1989 age-participation profiles intersect at age 60. Women younger than 60 have higher participation rates now than they did 20 years ago. Women aged 60 and over have lower participation rates, although the reduction is only 3 to 4 percentage points for women aged 62 and older.

Women aged 60 and over have lower participation rates, although the reduction is only 3 to 4 percentage points for women aged 62 and older.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…among those aged 50-62, the male-female difference in participation rates narrowed by roughly 15 percentage points during the 2 decades. The narrowing is more pronounced at the modal retirement ages 62-64, where participation rates for men dropped 20-25 points more than for women.

334~D1~V2~Variable~Labor Force Status~…in the main part of this article, researchers examine trends in transitions between labor force states rather than levels of participation per se.
334~V2~L1~Variable Value~Full-Time~…a labor status indicating an individual that is employed full-time in the labor market.
334~V2~L2~Variable Value~Part-Time~…a labor status indicating an individual that is employed part-time in the labor market.
334~V2~L3~Variable Value~Retirement~…a labor status indicating an individual that is retired from the labor market (i.e. nonparticipation).
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…a labor status indicating an individual that is retired from the labor market (i.e. nonparticipation).
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…detailed tabulations used in this study of labor force participation and transitions by sex, age, and year are available from researchers on request.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…calculation of participation rates are from the unmatched March CPS. The 1968 data are simple averages of age-specific participation rates for 1967, 1968, and 1968 (from the 1968-70 surveys). The 1989 data are from the 1989-91 surveys.
334~D1~T1~Time Period~1968.0~…the 1968 participation data are simple averages of age-specific participation rates for 1967, 1968, and 1969 (from the 1968-70 surveys).
334~D1~T2~Time Period~1989.0~…the 1989 data are from the 1989-91 surveys.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…it is important to emphasize that labor force participation rates per se are convolutions of transitions that have accrued over the full careers of the individuals observed.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…section V of this research paper uses a multinomial logit specification to parameterize age and time effects and to analyze the effects of other personal characteristics, such as race, education, and family composition. Model 2.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…section VI of this resarch paper changes the format, by switching from transitions to participation rates. The purpose in this section is to suggest that the search for explanations of trends in the labor force behavior of older people should primarily emphasize the larger question surrounding participation in general, and only secondarily should the peculiarities of advancing age be addressed.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data comes from two CPS sources: matched and unmatched March files. The matched files are used in Sections IV and V to study transitions between labor force states. The unmatched files are used in Section VI to compare trends in labor force participation of men and women of different ages.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"…although the Census bureau releases only unmatched files, it is possible to match individual records across adjacent surveys. The CPS uses a ""4 in-8 out-4-in"" monthly rotation scheme; that is, respondents are first interviewed for 4 successive months, and then, after an 8-month lapse, they are interviewed for an additional 4 months. For each rotation group the second wave of four interviews occurs 1 year later in the same calendar months as the first wave. Hence, if the sample size was constant and there was no attrition, half of sample in the March survey of any given year could in principle be matched with the following year's March survey, while the other half could be matched with the previous year's March survey. Because of attrition and the addition of new households, this ideal cannot be attained. As a general rule, in any given survey about three-quarters of the potential household matches can be realized. individual match rates within matched households average to about 90%."
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…when researchers restricted attention to civilians aged 49 to 68 in the first survey, the sample in a matched CPS file consisted on average of about 5,000 men and 5,700 women for each available year. This is comparable in size to the Retirment History survey (RHS) and the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Labor Market Experience of Older Men, the two data sets most commonly used to study retirment behavior.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…matched CPS data offer several advantages over the RHS and the NLS. First, the CPS provides direct information on labor force transitions over a 1-year interval, as opposed to the 2-year interval of the RHS and NLS. Second, unlike the RHS and NLS that follow a ingle cohort, our sample spans several cohorts and maintains a distribution by age and other individual characteristics that is relatively stable, changing only with sample noise and with aggregate movements. Third, the data covers the period from 1968 to 1990, although researchers have only 19 of the 23 potential matches. Household identfiers were scrambled in 1972 and shifted in 1977 and 1986. As a result, matched files for 1971-72, 1972-73, 1976-77, and 1985-86 are not available.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a disadvantage of the matched CPS is that researchers can only analyze changes over a 1-year period. More complicated patterns of state dependence cannot be addressed.
334~D1~T3~Time Period~1968-1990~...third, the data covers the period from 1968 to 1990, although researchers have only 19 of the 23 potential matches. Household identfiers were scrambled in 1972 and shifted in 1977 and 1986. As a result, matched files for 1971-72, 1972-73, 1976-77, and 1985-86 are not available.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…a problem with this data set is high attrition. The main sources of attrition in the CPS are individual and household mobility, noninterview, and temporary addition of Hispanic households to the March survey. Although lower than for the CPS as a whole, individual attrition rates for people aged 49 to 68 in the first survey average to about 20%. Since labor force behaviorand migration are correlated, transition estimates based on the matched CPS may be biased.
334~V2~L3~Variable Value~Retirement~…an operational definition of retirement is complicated by the fact that requriement has two distinct but related aspects. The first involves a decisions about when and how much to reduce the amount of labor supplied to the market. The second involves deciding when to start withdrawing annuities from accumulated pension or Social Security wealth. The labor participation aspect leads to identifying retirement either with withdrawal from the labor force or with a sudden and sizable reduction in labor supply. The other aspect leads to identifying retirement with recipiency of pension or Social Security income. In this article researchers focus on the labor force participation aspect of retirement.
334~D1~V2~Variable~Labor Force Status~…researchers use an instantaneous definition of labor force status, based on the number of hours worked during the week preceding the survey, integrated with some retrospective information, to define three mutually exclusive labor force states.
334~D2~D2~Dataset~Retirement History Survey~…the RHS is a panel of 11,153 individuals (8,131 men and 3,022 unmarried women) aged 58 to 63 in 1969, interviewed every 2 years from 1969 to 1979.
334~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Older Men~…the NLS-Older Men is a panel of 5,020 men aged 45 to 59 in 1966, interviewed 12 times between 1966 and 1983.
334~D2~D2~Dataset~Retirement History Survey~…individual attrition rates in the male sample of the RHS are 13.2% at the time of the second survey and 47.1% at the time of the last survey.
334~D3~D3~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Older Men~…individual attrition rates in the NLS-Older Men are 5.6% at the time of the second survey and 47.4% at the time of the last survey.
334~V2~L1~Variable Value~Full-Time~…a person is a full-time worker if he or she is at work and either is working at least 35 hours or, if working less than 35 hours, usually works 35 hours per week or has a full-time workweek of less than 35 hours. One who has a job but did not work in the week preceding the survey is classified as full-time if the job usually requires more than 35 hours per week. Those unemployed are classified as full-time workers if they are looking for a full-time job, have been unemployed for not more than 1 year, and worked at least 2 weeks at some time during the previous 5 years.
334~V2~L2~Variable Value~Part-Time~…those who are at work or having a job are classified as part-time if they are not full-time. Similarly, an unemployed person is classified as part-time if he or she is not full-time.
334~V2~L3~Variable Value~Retirement~…one who is neither full-time nor part-time is classified as retired (out of the labor force).
334~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Force Transitions~…presents adjacent years transitions between labor force states for the pooled surveys.
334~D1~F1~Findings~Labor State Transitions Among Men~…among the men aged 49-68, 68.5% participate full-time when first observed, and about 64% are full-time 1 year later. Similarly, 27% are retired at the time of the first survey, and 31% are retired at the time of the second survey. The fraction of men who are part-time does not change much between the two surveys. Of the men who are full-time in the second survey, 96.6% were full-time in the first, 1.9% were part-time, and 1.5% were retired. For women, the data shows a 1-year decline in full-time participation from 33% to 31%, with an associated increase in the fraction retired from 57% to 59%.
334~D1~F2~Findings~Part-Time to Retirement Transitions Across Genders~…roughly one fourth of employed women are part time, yet transitions from part-time acount fro 45% of all entries into retirement. The contrast is even sharper for men, where part-time accounts for one job in 15, and yet transitions from part-time represent nearly one-fourth of the entries into retirement.
334~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Labor Force Transitions~"…researchers analyze trends in labor force behavior within the context of a simple three-state Markov chain model linking labor force state probabilities in 2 successive years. There are several reasons for doing so. First, a Markov model provides one way of distinguishing between two types of information contained in the CPS. One is the ""stock"" information contained in the unmatched files, which is the basis for estimating participation probabilities. the other is the ""flow"" information contained int he matched files, which is the basis for estimating transition probabilities between labor force states. Second, most structural models of retirement behavior are formulated in terms of transition probabilities implied by a stochastic dynamic discrete choice problem. The reduced-form estimates obtained from the data may be viewed as the stylzed facts that a structural model ought to be able to reproduce. Third, since participation probabilities are essentially convulations of transition probabilities, the existence of a stable relationship between personal charactersitics and transition probabilities guarantees the existence of a stable relationship between personal characteristics and participation probabilities. In this case, a Markov model represents asimple and useful tool for predicting future participation given current labor force status."
334~D1~D1~Dataset~~…the stock information in the unmatched files is the basis for estimating participation probabilities. The flow information in the matched files is the basis for estimating transition probabilities between labor force states.
334~D1~DV2~Derived Variable~Participation Probabilities~…the stock information in the unmatched files of the CPS is the basis for estimating participation probabilities.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…the flow information contained in the matched files, which is the basis for estimating transition probabilites between labor force states.
334~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~State Probabilities~…[pi] is the vector of state probabilities.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabiltiies~…if [pi] is the vector of state probabilities, the link between state probabilities in 2 successive years for a group of persons of age a at time t is given by  [pi](a + 1, t + 1) = A(a, t)^T.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…the 1-year transition probability matrix, whose generic element is the conditional probability of moving from state (i) to state (j) over a 1-year period. A simple nonparametric estimate of the transition probability is its sample analog, namely, the fraction of individuals in state (i) at age a who move to state j between year t and year t+1.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…researchers present nonparametric estimates of the average matrix of transition probabilities by sex and age at the time of the first survey. The estimates are weighted averages of observed transition frequencies for cells defined by sex, age, and year, with weights equal tot he marginal distribution by sex, year, and labor force in the first survey.
334~D1~F3~Findings~Exit From Full-Time Work~…the first row of the matrix corresponds to the exit from full-time work. Although women have higher exit rates than men, especially at earlier ages, the profiles of the hazards are otherwise quite similar. The hazard of exit into retirement increases slowly at earlier ages, rises rapidly after age 59, has a first spike at age 61, a second sharper spike at age 64 and then declines somewhat. The jumps or spikes at ages 61 and 64 have typically been explained by the presence of convex kinks in the lifetime budget constrant faing a worker. The spike at age 64 has been explained by current Social Security regulations, which discourage work beyond age 65 and whose effect may be reinforced by private pension provisions and, prior to 1983, by mandatory retirement rules. The spike at age 61 has been explained by the presence of liquidity constraints in the credit market, coupled with the Social Security early retirement option at age 62.
334~D1~F4~Findings~Exit From Part-Time Work~…except for sampling noise, the hazards on the second and third row appear to be smooth, monotonic functions of age. Compared with full-time work or retirement, part-time work is a highly transient state, especially for men. The probability of remaining in a part-time job over a 1-year period shows very little age dependence for women but increases significantly with age for men.
334~D1~F5~Findings~Exit From Retirement~…exit rates from retirement are low, especially for women, and decline steadily with age. After age 60, retirement is almost an absorbing state with exit rates below 5% for both men and women.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…it is understood that when first-order Markov transition matrices are formed from group averages, they need not describe individual participation profiles, due to both to heterogeneity and state dependence, but they definitionally describe the average behavior of the group used to form them.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…researchers turn to the time-series evidence to verify the existence and nature of trends in the transitions between full-time work, part-time work, and retirment over the period 1968-90. 
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…present nonparametric estimates of the average matrix of transition probabilites by sex and year. Cell-specific transition rates are now averaged by age , with weights equal to the marginal distribution by sex, age, and labor force status in the first survey.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…to help in identifying trends in the data, researchers also plot a smooth scatter plot obtained by fitting a locally linear trend to the estimated transitions using Cleveland's (1979) loess method.
334~DV1~L4~Variable Value~Full-Time to Full-Time~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L5~Variable Value~Full-Time to Part-Time~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L6~Variable Value~Full-Time to Retirement~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L7~Variable Value~Part-Time to Full-Time~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L8~Variable Value~Part-Time to Part-Time~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L9~Variable Value~Part-Time to Retirement~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L10~Variable Value~Retirement to Full-Time~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L11~Variable Value~Retirement to Part-Time~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~DV1~L12~Variable Value~Retirement to Retirement~…one of nine labor state transitions of interest in the current research.
334~D1~V3~Variable~Sex~…the estimates of transition probabilities are weighted averages of observed transition frequencies for cells defined by sex.
334~D1~V4~Variable~Age~…the estimates of transition probabilities are weighted averages of observed transition frequencies for cells defined by age.
334~D1~V5~Variable~Year~…the estimates of transition probaiblities are weighted averages of observed transition frequencies for cells defined by year.
334~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Transition Probabilities~…cell-specific transition rates are now averaged by age, with weights equal to the marginal distribution by sex, age, and labor force status in the first survey.
334~D1~F6~Findings~Exit Rate Trends Across Genders~…there is a clear upward trend in the exit rates from full-time into part-time work, for both men and women. Exit rates from full-time work into retirement follow an upward trend up to the early 1980s, at least for men, and show some evidence of a reversal after 1982. For men, researchers also observe a negative trend in exit rates from part-time work and retirement into full-time work, and a positive trend in part-time retention rates. For all other transition rates, no clear trend emerges.
334~D1~DV5~Derived Variable~Exit Rates~…exit rates are compared from full-time work for four atge groups, namely 49 to 53, 54 to 60, 61 to 63, and 64 to 68.
334~V4~L13~Variable Value~49 to 53~…one of four age groups of studied due to a high probability of exit from the labor market.
334~V4~L14~Variable Value~54 to 60~…one of four age groups of studied due to a high probability of exit from the labor market.
334~V4~L15~Variable Value~61 to 63~…one of four age groups of studied due to a high probability of exit from the labor market.
334~V4~L16~Variable Value~64 to 68~…one of four age groups of studied due to a high probability of exit from the labor market.
334~D1~F7~Findings~Exit Rates Into Retirement Across Genders~…for both men and women aged 61 to 63, exit rates into retirement show a clear upward trend that continues throughout the 1980s. For people aged 64 and older, there is instead some evidence of a downward trend after the 1980-82 recession.
334~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Hazard Rates~…compares the hazards of transitions across the periods of interest.
334~DV6~L17~Variable Value~Hazard Rate from Full-Time to Retirement~…compares the hazards of exit full-time worker for the two subperiod 1968-77 and 1984-90.
334~D1~F8~Findings~Hazard for Exit into Retirement~…what captures the eyes is the behavior of the hazard for exit into retirement, which is characterized by a sharpening of the age 61 spike, and a corresponding decline of the age 64 spike. The emergence of the spike at age 61 is more striking for men, while the decline of the spike at age 64 is more pronounced for women. For women, a downward shift in the hazard before age 57 is also noticeable. Researchers interpret the emergence of the spike at age 61 as an indication that the number of people who would have retired earlier, if they had the possibility to do so, has increased over time.
334~V2~L3~Variable Value~Retirement~…it is hard to suspect a role for Social Security in early retirement. First, the ability to retire at aghe 62 has existed since 1963. Second, changes in Social Security, starting with the 1977 reform, have gone in the direction of discouraging early retirement.
334~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Hazard Rates~…figure 5 provides further detail by showing how the hazard rates for exit from full-time work have changed by birth cohort. In doing so, researchers consider five equally spaced birth cohorts, spanning the years from 1907 to 1931.
334~D1~V6~Variable~Birth Cohort~…researchers consider five equally spaced birth cohorts, spanning the years from 1907 to 1931.
334~V6~L18~Variable Value~1907-1911~…the first cohort, those born between 1907 and 1911, corresponds to the RHS sample.
334~V6~L19~Variable Value~1917-1921~…the third cohort, those born between 1917 and 1921, are the so-called notch babies. For this cohort, the 1977 amendments to the Social Security Act created a substantial, unanticipated reduction in benefits with respect to those born before 1917.
334~D2~D2~Dataset~Retirement History Survey~…the RHS is by far the most frequently studied data source on retirement.
334~D1~F9~Findings~Minimal Exit Rates Across Age Groups~…the matched CPS data show only minimal exit rates at age 61, followed by a huge spike at age 64. Over time, as researchers move to progressively more recent cohorts, reseachers see the age 61 spike emerge. What at the outset of the data was a single-peak hazard, soon becomes doubly peaked. The latest cohort that researchers see reaching age 61 has a spike at that age that is just as sharp as the age-64 spike for the previous cohort. Researchers think this is a vivid illustration that vis-a-vis current behavior the RHS is imply outdated. The lessons learned from it may no longer apply.
334~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Cross-Section Changes in Full-Time Participation~…in table 2, researchers present a decomposition of cross-sectional changes in full-time participation between 1968-71 and 1987-90 based on an identity [pi](1) - [pi](2), where [pi](t) = {[pi](49 + h, t)} denotes the cross-section age-participation profile in period t = 1, 2 estimated from the unmatched CPS, [pi](t)* = {[pi]*(49+h, t)} denotes the synthetic age-participation profile based on the cross section profile and age 49 participation in period t, and [pi](12)* = {[pi](1)*(49+h, 2)} denotes the synthetic age-participation profile based ont he cross-sectional transtion profile in period 2 and the age 49 participation in period 1.
334~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Cross-Section Age-Participation Profile~…[pi](t) = {[pi](49 + h, t)} denotes the cross-section age-participation profile in period t = 1, 2 estimated from the unmatched CPS.
334~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Synthetic Age-Participation Profile in Period t~...[pi](t)* = {[pi]*(49+h, t)} denotes the synthetic age-participation profile based on the cross section profile and age 49 participation in period t.
334~DV9~L20~Variable Value~Synthetic Age-Participation Profile in Period 2~...[pi](12)* = {[pi](1)*(49+h, 2)} denotes the synthetic age-participation profile based ont he cross-sectional transtion profile in period 2 and the age 49 participation in period 1.
334~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~1968-71 Difference Between Cross-Section and Synthetic Profiles~…[pi](t) - [pi](1)* is the difference betweent eh 1968-71 cross section profile and the synthetic one using 1968-71 transitions.
334~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Change Associated With Shifts in the Transition Matrices~…[pi](1)* - [pi](12)* is the change associated with shifts in the transition matrices between 1968-71 and 1987-90.
334~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~Cumulative Effect of Changes in Age 49 Participation~…[pi](12)* - [pi](2)* is the cumulative effect of changes in age 49 participation valued at final period transitions.
334~D1~DV13~Derived Variable~1987-90 Difference Between Cross-Section and Synthetic Profiles~…[pi](2)* - [pi](2) is the difference between the 1987-90 cross-section profile and the synthetic one using 1987-90 transitions. 
334~D1~DV14~Derived Variable~Cohort Effects~…the differences [pi](1) - [pi](1)* and [pi](2) - [pi](2)* may be interpreted as measures of the cohort effects at the start and the end of the data, respectively.
334~D1~F10~Findings~Understatement of Cross-Sectional Full-Time Participation~…the decomposition of the change for men shows first that the initial cross-section profile [pi](1) cannot be supported by the initially observed transitions. By projection the initial age 49 status to higher ages using initial transitions, researchers understate cross-sectional full-time participation by 6 to 12 percentage points in the 60 to 64 age range. This is one way of showing that the cohort participation profiles of older males were rapidly declining at the outset of the relevant CPS data.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…in section V, researchers parameterize individual transition probabilies by using a simple multinomial logit (MNL) specification. The aim is to verify how much of the results in the previous section survive after allowing other covariates to affect the basic relationship between transition rates, age, and time. Researchers focus on a number fo personal characteristics, such as education, race, marital status, household composition, health, unemployment, and self-employment status.
334~D1~V7~Variable~Education~…a personal characteristic controlled for in simple multinomial logit specifications in the current research.
334~D1~V8~Variable~Race~…a personal characteristic controlled for in simple multinomial logit specifications in the current research.

334~D1~V13~Variable~Self-Employment Status~…a personal characteristic controlled for in simple multinomial logit specifications in the current research.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…explanatory variables in the multinomial logit regressions include a function of age and time ony, and a vector of observable characteristics that may depend on a person's labor force status in the first survey.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the population log odds ratio is modeled as the sum of two components: the first describes in a flexible way the interaction between age and time, the second is an age- and time-invariant linear function of a vector of covariates that are simply assumed to shift proportionally the odds ratio of exit from each labor force status. This MNL specification is mainly a device for smoothing the data, although it could also be interpreted as an appoximation to the reduced form of some structural model of retirement behavior.
334~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Age and Time Function~…f(ij) is a function of age and time only.
334~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…x is a vector of observable individual characteristics that may depend on a person's labor force status in the first survey.
334~D1~DV17~Derived Variable~Population Log Odds Ratio~…the population log odds ratio is modeled as the sum of two components: the first describes in a flexible way the interaction between age and time, the second is an age- and time-invariant linear function of a vector of covariates that are simply assumed to shift proportionally the odds ratio of exit from each labor force status. This MNL specification is mainly a device for smoothing the data, although it could also be interpreted as an appoximation to the reduced form of some structural model of retirement behavior.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…this model could in principle be estimated without imposing any structure on f(ij). For convenience, researchers chose to work with a fully parametric specification, by representing f(ij) as a time-varying cubic spline in age, with a single knot at age 59 and a set of dummies at age 61, 62 and 64, plus an additive business-cycle effect.
334~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Age and Time Function~…this model could in principle be estimated without imposing any structure on f(ij). For convenience, researchers chose to work with a fully parametric specification, by representing f(ij) as a time-varying cubic spline in age, with a single knot at age 59 and a set of dummies at age 61, 62 and 64, plus an additive business-cycle effect.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…the current specificiationallows for most of the effects discussed in the previous section, namely, nonmonotonicity and the presence of spike in age-transition profiles, the presence of curvature in the time trends, potential differences in time trends at different ages, and the possible presence of business cycle effects.
334~D1~DV16~Derived Variable~Individual Characteristics~…all the covariates in the vector x are categorcal. They consist of a set of indicators for race, education, mariatl status, children of less than 18 years of age living with the family, health status, geographical region, and standard metropolitan statistical area. For those who were not retired at the week of the first survey, researchers included additional indicators for self-employment and unemployment status in the week of the first survey.

334~V14~L33~Variable Value~West~…one of four categorical indicators for geographical region.
334~D1~V15~Variable~SMSA~…individual covariates consist of a set of indicators for standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA).
334~V15~L34~Variable Value~In an SMSA~…one of three categorical indicators for SMSA.
334~V15~L35~Variable Value~Not in an SMSA~…one of three categorical indicators for SMSA.

334~D1~V13~Variable~Self-Employment Status~…for those who were not retired at the week of the first survey, researchers incuded additional indicators for self-employment status in the week of the first survey.
334~D1~V12~Variable~Unemployment Status~…for those who were not retired at the week of the first survey, researchers incuded additional indicators for unemployment status in the week of the first survey.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…researchers estimated model 2 separately by sex and labor force status in the first CPS year, using pooled data for the period 1968-91. At the top of table 3 researchers present the sample size, the number of estimated parameters and standard measures of goodness of fit for each set of estimates.
334~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Age and Time Function~…takes the form of a linear regression where u+ denotes the positve part of u, d is the vector of age-specific dummies, and DGNP is the average second seasonal difference of log real gross national product centered at the first quarter of year t. The intercept is a quadratic function of time, while the coefficient on age and the vector of coefficients on the age dummies are linear functions of time.
334~D1~V16~Variable~Age-Specific Dummies~…a vector of age-specific dummies.
334~D1~DV18~Derived Variable~DGNP~…the average seasonal difference of log real gross national product centered at the first quarter of year t.
334~V11~L37~Variable Value~Ill~"…a person classified as in bad health (""ill"") if illness or disability was reported as the main reason for wokring less than 50 weeks the year before the survey or if illness was reported as the reason for working less than 35 hours in the week before the survey. "
334~D1~V11~Variable Value~Health Status~…the fact that this is not an objective but rather a self assessed measure of health may exaggerate the effect of health on labor force transitions.
334~D1~V2~Variable~Labor Force Status~…an interesting question is whether the distinction between part-time participation and retirement is arbitrary in the case of exit from full-time work and the distinction between full-time and part-time work is arbitrary in the case of exit from retirement. In the current setting, testing for the pooling of states is equivalent to testing for the null hypothesis of equality of the MNL coefficients, apart from the intercepts.
334~D1~F11~Findings~Baseline Model Null Hypothesis Rejection~…researchers find that the null hypothesis is rejected in all multinomial specifications at any conventional level of significance.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…calculations are reported only for age 61 and for two different years, 1969 and 1989.
334~D1~F12~Findings~Business Cycle Effects~…business-cycle effects appear to be statistically significant in multinomial logit regressions only in the case of male exit from full-time into part-time work and female exit from part-time work into retirement. The sign of the coefficients is negative, confirming that the hazard of leaving the labor force is highest during recessions.
334~D1~F13~Findings~Education Effects~…education is a very important predictor of transition. Exit rates from full-time work and from retirement are strongly ordered by education level. People with higher education have a lower probability of leaving full-time work and a higher probability of entering the labor force from retirement. Men with higher education also have higher odds of leaving full-time work for a part-time job than retiring.
334~D1~F14~Findings~Race Effects~…race appears to be an important predictor in the case of exit from full-time work. Both hazards are higher for blacks than for nonblacks. Further, black women have much higher odds of leaving full-time work for a part-time job than black men, who have instead higher chances of simply retiring. Researchers find less evidence of race effects in the other transitions, but here again the estimated coefficients seem to indicate that black women have a greater attachment to the labor force than black men.
334~D1~F15~Findings~Family Characteristic Effects~…the effect of family characteristics differs markedly between men and women. Men who are not married have a higher probability of leaving the labor force and a lower probaiblity of exiting retirement. On the contrary, women who are not married have a significantly lower probability of leaving the labor force, and a higher proability of exiting retirement. Further, the presence of children in the family appears to significantly reduce the probability of leaving the labor force for men, while having only small effects for women. Overall, neglecting family characteristics leads to a major loss fit in the ase of women, especially in the case of exit from full-time work.
334~D1~F16~Findings~Geographical Region Effects~…geographical effects appear to be of some importance in the case of transitions from and into part-time work. In particular, living in the Northeast and in an SMSA significantly lowers exit rates from full-time into part-time work, while living in the South and in the West significantly reduces retention rates in part-time work for women.
334~D1~F17~Findings~Unemployment Status Effects~…unemployment status is one of the most important single predictors of transition, along with age, education, and health status. For both men and women, unemployment significantly increases the probability of leaving the labor froce. In particular, retention rates in full-time and part-time work drop very sharply for unemployed workers, while exit rates into retirement increase dramatically even at younger ages. This raises the question whether the distinction between unemployment and being out of the labor force is meaningful for older workers.
334~D1~M1~Methodology~Multinomial Logit~…to check stability over time of the etsimated MNL coefficients, researchers also fitted the model separately by CPS year and for both men and women. For simplicity researchers report only the results of the fitted model for exit from full-time work into retirement and for those coefficients that show clear evidence of trends. To enhance the understanding of trends, researchers again smooth the estimates using Cleveland's (1979) loess. The intial horizontal line is the 2 standard error band. The other horizontal line is the weighted average of the estimated coefficients, with weights equal to the reciprocal of the estimated variance of the coefficients in each year. Because observations in different matched CPS are independent, this is the minimum distance estimate under the assumptio of time homogeneity.
334~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Cubic Spline in Age~…the function f(ij)(a) in the fitted model is a cubic spline in age, with a single knot at age 59 and a set of dummies at age 61, 62, and 64.
334~D1~F18~Findings~Fitted Model Null Hypothesis Rejection~…in the fitted MNL model, the null hypothesis of no effecty of a variable is always rejected if the horizontal line at zero never pierces the 2 standard error band.
334~D1~F19~Findings~Exit Rates Into Retirement Across Race, Marital Status and Education~…estimates of the fitted model show that a trend toward increasing exit into retirement for black men exists. Again for men, the difference between college and high school graduates (the baseline education level) has widened, while the difference between high school dropouts and high school graduates has narrowed. Finally, researchers see indications of a weakening of the effect of marital status on female transitions.
334~V7~L24~Variable Value~High School Graduate~…this education category is regarded the baseline eduation level and is, in turn, eliminated to avoid collinearity of estimates.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…in section VI, researchers look at trends in labor force participation rates of men and women across all ages. The data are averages of individual employment rates, defined as weeks worked out of 52, and are computed from the 1966-90 unmatched CPS files.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data on labor force participation rates are averages of individual employment rates, defined as weeks worked out of 52, and are computed from the 1966-90 unmatched March CPS files.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~…in weeks worked for those who usually work part-time (less than 36 hours per week) are counted as half-weeks. Within single years of age, participation rates are weighted using CPS person weights. Rates for 5-year age brackets are unweighted averages of single age rates.
334~V4~L38~Variable Value~25 to 39~…one of six age intervals for which labor force participation rates are reported.
334~V4~L39~Variable Value~40 to 54~…one of six age intervals for which labor force participation rates are reported.
334~V4~L40~Variable Value~55 to 61~…one of six age intervals for which labor force participation rates are reported.
334~V4~L41~Variable Value~62 to 64~…one of six age intervals for which labor force participation rates are reported.
334~V4~L42~Variable Value~65 to 67~…one of six age intervals for which labor force participation rates are reported.
334~V4~L43~Variable Value~68 to 69~…one of six age intervals for which labor force participation rates are reported.
334~D1~V1~Variable~Participation~"…six age intervals are reported for participation rates. Within each age interval the rate reported is the simple average of the age-specific rates. The unconnected series of points labeled ""All"" refers to the simple average of the specific age 25 to 69 rates."
334~V4~L44~Variable Value~All~"…the unconnected series of points labeled ""All"" refers to the simple average of the specific age 25 to 69 rates."
334~D1~F20~Findings~Participation Trends Across Genders~…the combined relationships for men of all ages trace a step function in which participation dropped sharply in 1975 and again in 1982. Except for the 62-64 age interval, where participation continues to fall, there has been an apparent leveling in participation of men after 1982. The pattern for men is more or less consistent for all age groups. Prior to 1968, participation increased at all ages, but afterward the rates decline, and there are pronounced drops int he major recessions of 1975 and 1982. Patterns for women differ by age. Participation has increased for those less than 55 years old but have not increased for older women. The cyclic shocks are less clear for women than for men.
334~D1~DV20~Derived Variable~Change in Participation~…Figure 7c collapses the end-point data from the earlier two panels. It shows 1965-89 average annual rates of changes in participation by single year of age for men and for women. 
334~D1~F21~Findings~Age, Participation, and Gender~…from 1965 to 1989, participation fell for men of all ages and the average rate of change is roughly the same for men aged 25 to 54. By far the most dramatic changes have been for older men. The opposite pattern holds for women. Rates of change vary with age, and most of the action is at younger ages. Changes for women aged 60 and over have been trivial.
334~D1~DV21~Derived Variable~Participation Index~…the researchers' index is the simple average of the age-specific participation rates with part-time employment disconted to full-time equivalence. As such, the index is not sensitive to changes in the age distribution of employment, but it is sensitve to shifts between part-and full-time work.
334~D1~DV22~Derived Variable~Population Log Odds Ratio~…Figure 8a graphs the data shown in Figure 7a with two changes. First, the participation rates are transformed to log ratios. Second, the averages within each age group are subtracted from the observed levels. The log-odds transformation produces similar scale, while the subtraction forces each of the age-group series to have the same average values of zero. The idea is to remove scale and level to that of similarity of the trends can be inspected.
334~D1~F22~Findings~Attractiveness of Work for Men~…in Figure 8a, the time paths are remarkably similar for men of different ages. Not only are cyclic shocks congruent, the scaled trends are as well (the major exception to this general statement is that cyclic shocks, both the downturns in recessions and the subsequent rebounds, are more pronounced for younger men. It can be shown that the commonality of falling employment in figure 8a is not an artifact of falling weeks worked for younger men with an increasing proportion of older men who do not work at all. Instead, in the period after 1968, the proportion of not working fell for men of all ages, as did weeks worked among those who work). Thus, the forces shaping employment for younger men do not appear to be fundamentally different from the forces determining the participation behavior of the oldest. In either case, relative to nonmarket alternatives, work is not as attractive to as many men todayas it was in the late 1960s.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…Matched CPS data ought to be considered an important source of information about labor force behavior. In particular, these data make it possible to distinguish between changes in labor force transitions and changes in participation at an initial age - a distinction that reserachers believe is important in order to understand the different trends of older men and women.
334~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…although the CPS does not contain specific information on a firm's pension plan, it does contain information on pension availability and coverage starting with the 1979 survey. Since the March CPS contains fairly detailed information on personal and household income, evidence on the role of pensions and Social SEcurity may also come from the analysis of trends in the structure of pre- and postretirement income.
334~D1~F23~Findings~Correlation of Male and Female Participation~…the observed negative correlation in the time series of male and female participation raises yet another problem. At the aggregate level, it suggests the presence of a substitution effect. At the household level, however, the evidence is of complementarity. Men who do not work are more likely to have a spouse who also does not work.
334~D1~F24~Findings~Young Women and Labor Force Participation~…increasing labor force participation of the younger cohorts of women is associated with changes in marital and fertility decisions. Because of this, the effects of family background variables, such as marital status, spouse's income, and number of children, on female participation probabilities and labor force transitions are also likely to change in the future.

335~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…this paper uses longitudinal Social Security earnings data from 1957 to 1974 to reexqmine the precise timing of changes in the earnings differentials between black and white male workers.
335~D1~T1~Time Period~1957-1974~…longitudinal Social Security earnings data is drawn from the 1957 to 1974 survey period to reexamine the precise timing of changes in the earnings differentials between black and white male workers.
335~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…analysis of the racial disparity in earnings has been infeasible in the past because Current Population Survey (CPS) micro data sets are unavailable before 1964 and because published tabulations lack sufficient detail to follow particular cohorts over time.
335~D1, D3~T2~Time Period~Pre-1964~…the Current Population Survey micro data sets are unavailable before 1964, i.e. the year that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was indoctrined.
335~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey micro data sets are unavailable before 1964, i.e. the year that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was indoctrined.
335~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Black Men's Relative Wages~…the current analysis of cohort-level earnings reveals a discrete break in the upward trend in black men's relative wages after 1964. This finding is consistent with the important role many researchers have attached to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
335~D1, D2, D3~F2~Findings~Upward Trend in Black Men's Relative Earnings Prior to 1965~…the current analysis finds evidence of an upward trend in black workers' relative earnings prior to 1965 (particularly for Southern workers), suggesting that other factors also contributed to the economic progress of black men between 1960 and 1975.
335~D3~D3~Dataset~Decennial Censuses~…this data is used to summarize trends in the black-to-white ratio of various measures of annual earnings using data from the Decennial Censuses and March CPS.

335~D3~F3~Findings~Mean Earnings Ratio Trends Across the Relative Time Period~…the ratio of mean earnings of blacks relative to whites increased substantially between 1960 and 1980 and then stagnated in the 1980's. Between 1960 and 1970, for example, the black-white ratio of average earnings for men aged 20 to 59 increased by 7 percentage points. It grew another 6 percentage points between 1970 and 1980, but was constant over the 1980's. Similar results hold for a comparison of median earnings.

335~D3~F4~Findings~p50/p25 Ratio vs. Other Earnings Ratios~…the p50/p25 ratio shows a greater secular increase than the other earnings ratios: a gain of 34 percentage points between 1960 and 1990. Unlike the other relative earnings measures, this ratio continued to increases between 1980 and 1990.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Earnings Ratios~…earnings ratios are reported for ten-year birth cohorts.
335~D3~F5~Findings~1960 and 1970 Mean Earnings Ratios~…for 1960 and 1970 the ratios of mean earnings show only small increases for each of the three continuing cohorts.
335~D3~F6~Findings~p50/p25 Ratio and Birth Cohorts~…the p50/p25 ratio increased for the two older cohorts, but declined substantially for the youngest continuing cohort. A comparison with trends over the 1970's and 1980's suggest that it is typical for the median black worker to lose ground relative to the 25th percentile white worker as a cohort ages from its 20's to its 30's. Moreover, the decline in the p50/p25 ratio between 1960 and 1970 (-0.12) is smaller than the decline for the 1940's cohort between 1970 and 1989 (-0.37) or the decline for the 1950's cohort between 1980 and 1990 (-0.27).
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…researchers created a new source of data on black-white earnings trends by pooling data from the 1973 and 1978 linked Current Population Survey and Social Security Earnings Records (CPS-SER) files. This pooled CPS-SER file contains administrative earnings data for a sample of 61,707 black and white men each year between 1957 and 1974. Unfortunately, the Social Security tax ceiling creates a problem of censored earnings for many workers. In some years, the Social security maximum is below the earnigns of the median white male. Another problem with Social Security data is incomplete coverage, although Wendy Alvey and Cynthia Cobleigh (1980) estimate that 90% of workers were covered by Social Security in 1973.
335~D1~V2~Variable~Social Security Maximum~…in some years, the Social Security maximum is below the earnings of the median white male. 
335~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Earnings Ratios~…to assess the reliability of the Social Security data, trends in the aggregate black-white earnings ratio based on the CPS-SER file and on CPS data.  
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…researchers report CPS-SER earnings ratios for the whole country, and separately for workers who lived in the South in 1973 or 1978. The CPS-SER figures are for an evolving sample of all men aged 20 to 59 in any particular year.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Earnings Ratios~…researchers report CPS-SER earnings ratios for the whole country, and separately for workers who lived in the South in 1973 or 1978. The CPS-SER figures are for an evolving sample of all men aged 20 to 59 in any particular year. Because of censoring, researchers report CPS-SER data on the ratio of the 40th percentile of earnings.
335~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the CPS data pertain to all men aged 14 or older in any year. The CPS series represents the ratio in median black earnings to median white earnings. 
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…because of censoring, researchers report CPS-SER data on the ratio of the 40th percentiles of earnings. The 40th percentile of white earnings for the whole United States is above the taxable maximum in 1965, leading to a gap.
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…although the Social Security earnings histories are far from ideal, researchers note that changes in the design of the CPS in 1996 cloud time-series based on that data set.
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…one minor difficulty with this data is that men included in the current CPS-SER sample of earners in 1959 (for example) must have been alive in 1973 or 1978. Researchers have examined the age and earnings distributions in the CPS-SER data and believe that the biases induced by nonrandom mortality are small.
335~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to summarize trends in the earnings ratios of blacks relative to whites, researchers regressed the black-white earnings ratio on a constant, a linear time trend, and a post-1964 trend.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Linear Time Trend~…to summarize trends in the earnings ratios of blacks relative to whites, researchers regressed the black-white earnings ratio on a linear time trend.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Post-1964 Trend~…to summarize trends in the earnings ratios of blacks relative to whites, researchers regressed the black-white earnings ratio on a post-1964 trend.
335~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Relative Earnings Ratios for CPS and CPS-SSR Data~…for the CPS series, time trend regressions indicate a narrowing of the gap of relative earnings ratios by 0.14 percentage points per year before 1965, with a significantly greater rate of convergence after 1965 (a total of 1.36 points per year). Using the nationwide Social Security data, however, the regressions indicate a 0.92-percentage-point annual rate of convergence before 1964, with an insignificant increase of 0.21 percentage points per year in the trend after 1965.
335~DV1~L10~Variable Value~p50/p25~…Figure 2 compares the median black worker to the 25th-percentile white worker.
335~DV1~L10~Variable Value~p50/p25~…in addition to avoiding censoring problems in the white earnings distribution, the p50/p25 comparison has the advantage of crudely controlling for any economy-wide changes in the shape of the earnings distribution.
335~DV1~L10~Variable Value~p50/p25~…estimates of this ratio are based on an evolving sample of workers between the ages of 20 and 59 each year.
335~D1, D2~F8~Findings~p50/p25 Earnings Ratio Pre- and Post-1964~…p50/p25 earnings ratio estimates indicate that black workers suffered a relative earnings decline between 1962 and 1965. After 1965, however, there was sustained improvement in black workers' relative earnings until the early 1970's.
335~D1, D2~F9~Findings~p50/p25 Earnings Ratio and Region~…judging from p50/p25 ratio estimates, the median black worker in the South gained almost 15 percentage points relative to the 25th-percentile-white worker between 1966 and 1968. The Social Security earnings data also show a sizable increase in relative earnings for blacks outside the South, although the growth took place more slowly. The ratios also suggest that the relative position of blacks in the South began to decline in the late 1960's, while it continued to increase outside the South. One should bear in mind, however, that the regional breakdowns are based on individual residence in 1973 or 1978 (rather than place of residence in the year of earnings) and may be biased by selective migration.
335~D2~V3~Variable~Region of Residence~…regional breakdowns are based on individual residence in 1973 or 1978 (rather than place of residence in the year of earnings) and may be biased by selective migration.
335~D2~T7~Time Period~1973, 1978~…regional breakdowns are based on individual residence in 1973 or 1978 (rather than place of residence in the year of earnings) and may be biased by selective migration.
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…the CPS-SER earnings histories enable researchers to examine trends in relative earnings for given cohorts over time.
335~D1~V4~Variable~Earnings~…the CPS-SER earnings histories enable researchers to examine trends in relative earnings for given cohorts over time.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Earnings Ratios~…the CPS-SER earnings histories enable researchers to examine trends in relative earnings for given cohorts over time. By examining the time-series patterns of black-white relative earnings for fixed cohorts, researchers can assess alternative explanations for the improvement in the economic position of workers between 1960 and 1970. Most impotantly, if changes in schooling are the primary explanation for black workers' relative gains, researchers would not expect to find an increase in the black-white earnings ratio within cohorts. On the other hand, if the Civil Rights Act led to an increase in economic opportunities for black workers, researchers would expect to find an upturn in black-white earnings ratios after 1965 within cohorts. Finally, if secular factors such as northern migration contributed to black workers' economic progress, researchers would exect to find an upward trend in the black-white earnings ratio for given cohorts prior to 1965.
335~DV1~L10~Variable Value~p50/p25~…Figure 3 displays the ratio of median black earnings to the 25th percentile of white earnings for three cohorts of workers in each year between 1957 and 1974.
335~D1~T1~Time Period~1957-1974~…Figure 3 displays the ratio of median black earnings to the 25th percentile of white earnings for three cohorts of workers in each year between 1957 and 1974.
335~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…to summarize the time-series relationships between the ratio of median black earnings to the 25th percentile of white earnings for three cohorts of workers in each year between 1957 and 1974, researchers again regressed the black relative earnings ratio on a constant, a time trend, and a post-1964 time trend.
335~D1, D2~F10~Findings~1910-1919 and 1920-1929 Cohort-Specific Regression Estimates~…the cohort-specific regressions confirm the visual impression of an acceleration in black-white earnings convergence after 1965. The 1910-1919 cohort closed the racial gap in earnings by 1.68 points per year after 1965, while the 1920-1929 cohort closed the gap by 0.83 points per year after 1965. For both of these cohorts there was an upward trend in blacks' earnings relative to whites prior to 1965, but the post-1964 trend is significantly steeper. 
335~D1, D2~F11~Findings~1930-1939 Cohort-Specific Regression Estimates~…the cohort-specific regressions estimate patterns displayedn by the 1930-1939 cohort is especially noteworthy. Between 1957 and 1964, the median black worker in this cohort lost substantial ground relative to the 25th-percentile white worker. However, this decline in the black workers' position was arrested in 1965, and between 1965 and 1974 the median black worker gained 12 percentage points on the 25th-percentile white worker.
335~V1~L4~Variable Value~1910-1919~…one of three birth cohorts of interest in time-series relative earnings within cohort regressions.

335~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…researchers performed cohort-specific analysis on the subsample of men living in the South in 1973 or 1978.
335~V3~L11~Variable Value~South Only~…researchers performed cohort-specific analysis on the subsample of men living in the South in 1973 or 1978.
335~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Region-Specific Cohort-Specific Regression Estimates~…results of the South-specific cohort-specific regressions lead to qualitatively similar conclusions to the baseline cohort-specific regressions, although the pre-1965 trend is greater for the 1910-1919 cohort in the South than for the same cohort nationwide, whereas the post-1964 trend is greater for the 1920-1929 cohort in the South than for the same cohort nationwide.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Linear Time Trend~…the trend is divided by 100.
335~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Post-1964 Trend~…years since 1964 (divided by 100).
335~D3~D3~Dataset~Decennial Censuses~…to gain a better understanding of the convergence illustrated in Figure 3 researchers used Decennial Census data to investigate the average characteristics of workers who earned within 2.5 percent of the median or 25th-percentile worker in their race and cohort.
335~D3~V5~Variable~Education~…to gain a better understanding of the convergence illustrated in Figure 3 researchers used Decennial Census data to investigate the average education levels of workers who earned within 2.5 percent of the median or 25th-percentile worker in their race and cohort.
335~D3~F13~Findings~Cohort-Specific Educational Attainment and Earnings Ratios~…within each birth cohort, black workers near the median black earner have lower education than white workers near the 25th-percentile white worker. For example, in 1960 black workers near the median black worker have an average of 7.5 years of education, whereas white workers near the lower-quartile white worker have an average of 9.5 years of education. These figures are hardly different in 1970. By 1980, however, the gap in education between the median black worker and the lower quartile white worker fell to about half a year. Black men with earnings close to the median black earner are also far more likely to live in the South than are white men with earnings close to the 25th-percentile white earner. Researchers conclude that the relative earnings gains documented in Figure 3 and Table 2 occured for poorly educated Southern black workers.
335~D1~D1~Dataset~CPS-SER~…researchers used the CPS-SER data to examine participation rates of black and white workers.
335~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rates~…researchers used the CPS-SER data to examine participation rates of black and white workers.
335~D1~F14~Findings~Labor Force Participation Rates and Relativd Earnings Ratios~…one explanation for the closing of the black-white earnings gap in the 1960's is that lower-earning black workers were led to withdraw from the labor market by the increasing generosity of social-welfare programs. The fact that overall labor-force participation rates declined more for black men than for white men between 1960 and 1970 is consistent with this view.
335~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Labor Force Participation Rates~…here, researchers measure participation by the probability of employment in the covered sector within a calendary year. For each ten-year birth cohort, researchers calculated the fraction of the population with earnings from covered employment by race and year.
335~D1~F15~Findings~Labor Force Withdrawal and Convergence~…an examination of the black-white ratios of covered employment rates indicates no discrete change after 1965. If anything, black workers' covered employment rates increased relative to those of whites in the mid-1960's. This pattern suggests that selective labor-force withdrawal cannot account for the trend-shift in the rate of convergence of black-white relative earnings after 1965.
335~D1~T1~Time Period~1957-1974~…in this paper, researchers have assembled a new micro data base to reexamine trends in black-white relative earnings for specific cohorts of male workers between 1957 and 1974. To control for possible changes in the overall distribution of earnings, researchers focus on the ratio of median black earnings to the 25th percentile of white earnings.

394~394: Public Health Insurance and Private Savings~~~~

394~D1, D3, D4~F1~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Wealth Holdings~Researchers document that Medicaid eligibility has a sizable and significant negative effect on wealth holdings, and researchers confirm this finding by showing a strong positive association between Medicaid eligibility and consumption expenditures. Researchers also exploit the fact that asset testing was phased out by the Medicaid program over this period to document that these Medicaid effects are much stronger in the precence of an asset test.
394~D1~DV1~Derived Variable~Asset/Income Ratio~…the median asset/income ratio for households headed by a 35-44 year old high school dropout is one-tenth that of households headed by a 35-44-year-old college graduate.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~This paper assesses the savings impacts of one major social insurance program, Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income individuals. By providing first-dollar coverage of medical expenditures for qualifying individuals, Medicaid substantially lowers the expenditure risk facing both uninsured families and those privately insured families that drop plans with large copayments or deductibles to join the free Medicaid program. Moreover, along with means testing, Medicaid has also traditionally incorporated asset tests into its eligibility determination proceess. If social insurance is playing the role suggested by the Hubbard et al. model, savings and consumption should respond to programs such as Medicaid.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Medicaid program substantially eased its eligibility criteria over this period, first by state fiat and later by federal mandate. The expansion occurred at a differential pace across the states, and even within states through differential age cutoffs for the eligibility of children. This quasi randomization of insurance coverage allows researchers to assess the effect of providing free health insurance on savings behavior while avoiding issues of selection in who chooses public insurance coverage. Moreover throughout this period, states were removing their asset tests for program qualification. This allows researchers to quantiy the interaction between means testing and asset testing of eligibility for this program.
394~D3~T1~Time Period~1988-1991~During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Medicaid program substantially eased its eligibility criteria over this period, first by state fiat and later by federal mandate. The expansion occurred at a differential pace across the states, and even within states through differential age cutoffs for the eligibility of children. This quasi randomization of insurance coverage allows researchers to assess the effect of providing free health insurance on savings behavior while avoiding issues of selection in who chooses public insurance coverage. Moreover throughout this period, states were removing their asset tests for program qualification. This allows researchers to quantiy the interaction between means testing and asset testing of eligibility for this program.
394~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~To carry out the Medicaid impact test, researchers use data from two sources. The first is the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the largest nationally representative survey with annual data on the asset holdings of the U.S. population.
394~D2~D2~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~To carry out the Medicaid impact test, researchers use data from two sources. The second is the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), the only U.S. database with annual data on total family consumption levels.
394~D3, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Household Specific Medicaid Expansion~Researchers construct a household-specific valuation of the Medicaid expansions and match this measure to the SIPP data on household asset holdings and the CEX data on consumption.
394~D1, D3, D4~F2~Findings~Generosity of a Family's Public Insurance Entitlement and Asset Holdings~Researchers find a highly significant, negative relationship between the generosity of family's public insurance entitlement and that family's asset holdings. This finding is confirmed by showing that there is strong positive effect of Medicaid entitlement on consumption spending. And, in both cases, researchers find that the effect of Medicaid eligibility is much stronger in the presence of an asset test. The robustness of the findings across two very different sources of data confirms that Medicaid is an important determinant of the savings decisions of eligible households.

394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~Medicaid coverage of medical expenses was traditionally limited primarily to very low income, single female-headed families that received cash welfare under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Beginning in 1984, however, the program expanded eligibility for all children and for pregnant women; that is, for women, these expansions applied to the expenses of pregnancy. From 1984 to 1987, there were increases in Medicaid eligibility for very poor families that did not meet the eligiblity criterion because of family structure (these changes expanded on similar state programs that existed before 1984). From 1987 onward, there were substantial increases in the income cutoff for Medicaid eligibility for children and pregnant women in all family structures. By 1990, states were required to cover all pregnant women and children under the age of 6 up to 133% of poverty (independent of family composition) and were allowed to expand coverage up to 185% of poverty. A number of states have even expanded coverage above 185% of poverty for pregnant women and infants, using only state funds with no federal match. In addition, children born after September 30, 1989, were mandatorily covered up to 100% of poverty (once again independent of family composition). Nationally, the expansions had an enormous impact on the Medicaid eligibility of children and pregnant women: by 1992, roughly one-third of the children in the United States were eligible for Medicaid for coverage of their medical expenses, and almost one-half of the women were eligible for the expenses of pregnancy. 
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~While most of the legislative action over this period occurred at the federal level, there was tremendous heterogeneity in the impacts of Medicaid policy changes across the states. States initially had different qualification limits through AFDC and other optional programs, so that the uniform national expansions had differential impacts. In addition, states took up the new eligibility options at different rates, providing variaiton in the timing of the expansions as well as the ultimate size of their effects. There was also variation within states in the eligibility of children of different ages for the Medicaid expansions due to different age threshold in the laws.
394~D3, D4~V2~Variable~Age Cutoffs~Table 1, updated from Yelowitz (1995), illustrates this variation by showing the age and percentage of poverty cutoffs for expansions to the youngest group of children in each state at four different points in time. There were additional expansions for older groups of children as well, but this table usefully illustrates the variation in elgibility that researchers exploit in the estimation.
394~D3~V3~Variable~Percentage of Poverty Cutoffs~Table 1, updated from Yelowitz (1995), illustrates this variation by showing the age and percentage of poverty cutoffs for expansions to the youngest group of children in each state at four different points in time. There were additional expansions for older groups of children as well, but this table usefully illustrates the variation in elgibility that researchers exploit in the estimation.
394~D3~T1~Time Period~1988-1991~In January 1988, only some states had expanded eligibility, and the income and age cutoffs varied. By December 1989, all states had some expansion in place since federal law mandated coverage of infants up to 75% of the poverty line; ut some states had expanded coverage up to age 7 or 8, and the coverage ranged as high as 185% of the poverty line. By December 1991, state policies were more uniform as the most restrictive federal mandates had taken place, but some variatoin in poverty cutoffs remained. In supsequent years, several states expanded the age limits even further, using only state funds.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~In January 1988, only some states had expanded eligibility, and the income and age cutoffs varied. By December 1989, all states had some expansion in place since federal law mandated coverage of infants up to 75% of the poverty line; ut some states had expanded coverage up to age 7 or 8, and the coverage ranged as high as 185% of the poverty line. By December 1991, state policies were more uniform as the most restrictive federal mandates had taken place, but some variatoin in poverty cutoffs remained. In supsequent years, several states expanded the age limits even further, using only state funds.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~"A key feature of Medicaid expansions is that the population that was affected was not just the uninsured, but also those with private insurance. Indeed, as Cutler and Gruber (1996) note, two-thirds of those made elgibible for the Medicaid expansions were already covered by private insurance before becoming eligible. This raises the prospect that the expansion of the Medicaid program may have ""crowded out"" purchases of private insurance, a claim that has found empirical support in a series of papers over the past several years."
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~V4~Variable~State~…state indicators are included to differentiate for differences in Medicaid coverage and cutoffs across state boundaries.
394~D3, D4~V2~Variable~Age Cutoffs~The age limit represents the oldest that a child could be (at a given point in time) and still be eligible for expansion coverage.
394~D3~V3~Variable~Percentage of Poverty Cutoffs~Medicaid represents the Medicaid income limit for an infant (the maximum for an older child is less).
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~There are three channels through which increased Medicaid generosity might affect savings and consumption decisions: precautionary accumulation, redistribution, and asset testing. First, by reducing medical expenditure risk for eligible families, the Mediaid program lowers their need for precautionary savings. This will raise consumption and lower wealth holdings. Of course, this effect will operate only to the extent to which eligible (low-income) families are using savings as self-insurance against medical risk. Self insurance of medical risk. Self-insurance of medical expenses, despite their high variability, may be a reasonable option for many families. Unless a family has access to a large group through which to purchase insurance, health insurance can be prohibitively expensive, and non-group policies often come with sever limitations on benefits that further reduce their value. There may also be some self-insurance of medical spending risk among the insured who (potentially) move onto the Medicaid program as well. The average privately insured family pays about one-third of its medical costs. These costs are to some extent variable (up to plan out-of-pocket maxima), so that families that do not typically hit the out-of-pocket maximum may be saving as insurance against a particularly expensive year of medical spending. In contrast, Medicaid provides first-dollar coverage of virtually all medical expenses. Thus, when a privately insured family moves onto Medicaid, its (limited) precautionary savings may be reduced.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~…over the entire lifetime, the consumption effect is ambiguous. When there is no bequest motive, individuals will eventually desire to run down their stock of precautionary savings against medical risk as they near the end of life and the total stock of precautionary savings against medical risk as they near the end of life and the total stock of future risk shrinks. Thus reduced income risk will raise consumption today but may lower it close to the end of life. In the empirical work, however, researchers focus on families with no members over age 64, so that for this younger sample there should be only negative effects of medical risk on consumption and thus postiive effects of increases in Medicaid eligibility.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~There are three channels through which increased Medicaid generosity might affect savings and consumption decisions: precautionary accumulation, redistribution, and asset testing. The negative effect of precautionary accumulation on wealth holdings is offset by the second effect. Medicaid is explicitly redistributive and as such increases the resources of persons who become eligible for the program. For those who were previously uninsured, this increase ocurs through reducing their expected medical outlays. For those who have private insurance but choose to drop it in order to sign up for the Medicaid program, there is a reduction in expected outlays for both out-of-pocket spending and insurance payments. This redistributive transfer is transitory: it lasts only as long as the family is eligible for Medicaid, on both income and demographic grounds. Thus, to the exten that families are operating in a forward-looking life cycle framework, the transfer will be saved and spread over future periods in which there is higher risk of out-of-pocket medical expenses, offsetting the precautionary savings effect. On the other hand, to the extent that families are not perfectly forward-looking, some of this transfer will be spent today. Moreover, if the family is qualifying for Medicaid because it is transitorily poor, then the transfer will also be spent. In this case, the increase in savings from this transfer will be smaller; in the limit, there may be no change in savings, and it will all be spent today. Thus the net effect of expanded Medicaid on wealth accumulation is ambiguous. On the other hand, the efffect on consumption is unambiguous: it will increase through reduced precautionary accumulation, as well as (to some extent) through increased spending in response to this redistributive transfer.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~There are three channels through which increased Medicaid generosity might affect savings and consumption decisions: precautionary accumulation, redistribution, and asset testing. The third and final channel is one that is highlighted by Hubbard et al. (1995): asset testing. Traditionally, elgibility for AFDC (and hence Medicaid) was conditioned on asset holdings of less than $1,000 per family. As part of the legislation that allowed states to expand their income cutoffs for Medicaid eligibility, the federal government also authorized states to remove their asset tests for determining eligibility. States were quick to drop asset testing once they had the chance, so that by the middle of 1989, fewer than 10 states still had asset tests. Over the entire population, asset tests should lower savings: but this effect might be expected to be small, to the extent that a large share of the population does not consider Medicaid to be a relevant option. Of more interest for the current purposes is the interaction of asset tests with eligibility. On the one hand, following the logic of Hubbard et al., in a world with an asset test, individuals who are made eligible on income grounds but not on asset grounds may reduce their savings to qualify for the program. In this case the presence of an asset test will exacerbate the savings reduction (and consumption increase) from expanding Medicaid since the newly eligible individuals must reduce their savings to qualify (on top of the precautionary effect discussed earlier). On the other hand, if an asset test is in place, newly eligible individuals with reasonably high savings may not consider this program a realistic option, so that the expansions will not affect their savings. Under this model, asset tests may mitigate the savings and consumption effects of expansions since there is no precautionary savings effect or redistributive effect for newly eligible persons who are high savers (and who consider the program irrelevant). Finally, asset tests may have no effect in that they are not binding or difficult to enforce. Thus the net interactive effect of asset tests and eligibility is unclear. As a result, on net across these three effects, there is an ambiguous prediction for the effect of Medicaid eligibility on savings, but an unambiguous prediction that Medicaid eligibility should raise consumption.
394~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~The data come from two sources. The first is the Survey of Income and Program Participation, covering the years 1984-93. A new SIPP panel is introduced each calendar year, follows individuals for 24-32 months, and surveys approximately 15,000-20,000 households. Because the panels overlap, households from as many as three different panels may be observed at a given point in time. Each panel interviews individuals in four-months intervals known as waves, where the respondent is asked retrospective information about income, labor force activity, and participation status in public programs over the preceding four months.
394~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~"The other major element of the SIPP is the various ""topical modules"" that are included during selected household visits. One of these supplements provides information on household wealth holdings. These questions are asked once or twice per panel, usually one year apart. This regular source of data on wealth holdings, collected for a large nationally representative sample over the period of the Medicaid expansions, makes the SIPP the best data source for the current purposes. The wealth inventory is available for the fourth and seventh waves of 1984-86, the fourth wave of 1987, 1990, and 1992, and the seventh wave of 1991."

394~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~The unit of observation in the SIPP sample is the household; since the wealth summary measures are collected only at the household level, researchers exclude households with more than one family in residence. The sample consists of all households that were present in the SIPP at the point of the wealth interview, in which the head is between the ages of 18 and 64, and in which there are no household members over the age of 64, so that researchers can avoid complications arising from public insurance provided to those aged 65 and over by the Medicare program. And researchers consider only households that live in a state that is uniquely identified by the SIPP, which groups some of the smaller states.

The CEX collects information on a complete inventory of consumption items for a rotating sample of households each year. Households are interviewed for up to four quarters, providing information on household characteristics and consumption of different categories of goods. Researchers use total nondurable, nonmedical consumption as their dependent variable for part of the CEX analysis.

394~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV4~Derived Variable~Medical Expenditure Risk~The impact of Medicaid on household savings decisions will be determined by the magnitude of the associated reduction in medical expenditure risk for that household. 
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~"Researchers therefore define the generosity of the Medicaid program for a given household as the amount of expected medical spending that is made eligible for the Medicaid program, which researchers call ""Medicaid eligible dollars."" This measure of generosity varies across households for three reasons. The first is the legislative environment, which determines the types of individuals eligible for Medicaid (i.e., age ranges of eligibility for children) and the income level. The second is household characteristics, both those that determine eligibility (such as income) and those that determine the value of being eligible. Since (e.g.) a newborn is more medically costly than a 10-year-old, family structure determines how much medical spending will be made eligible for the family under a given legislative environment. And the third is the cost of medical care in the area. This measure provides a natural parameterization of the effects of the Medicaid program on teh household unit as a whole, which should determine savings decisions."
394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~…for each child and each women of childbearing age, researchers assign a likelihood of being Medicaid eligible, based on their characteristics, using a detailed simulation model of Medicaid eligibility described in Currie and Gruber (1996a, 1996b).

394~D3, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Index of Relative State-Specific Medical Costs~The index varies from 0.70 in Mississippi to 1.38 in New York (there is one outlier state - Alaska - with a value of 1.77).

394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~Researchers combine the two components of generosity to form Medicaid eligible dollars where MED(j) is the expected dollars of medical spending that are made eligible for family j, which consists of individuals (i). As medicaid becomes more generous, either by increasing its income cutoffs or covering more expensive family members, MED rises. Researchers measure this value at each of the waves that precedes and includes the wealth wave in the SIPP and at each quarterly interview in the CEX, and researchers use the average in the regression. In this way, researchers smooth any noise in the measurement of family structure.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Researchers measure this Medicaid eligible dollars value at each of the waves that precedes and includes the wealth wave in the SIPP and at each quarterly interview in the CEX, and researchers use the average in the regression. In this way, researchers smooth any noise in the measurement of family structure.
394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~One practical problem with this approach, however, is that income is endogenous on the savings/consumption decision: income depends directly on savings through capital income receipt; labor supply may be changing as a result of efforts to qualify for Medicaid; and changes in private insurance coverage that result from becoming eligible may be reflected in wages (to the extent that the employer costs of insurance are shifted to wages) as well as in savings.
394~D3, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Index of Relative State-Specific Medical Costs~This normalization has two potential weaknesses. First, it is possible that the value of Medicaid is not determined by area-specific costs; it may be that the value is viewed in terms of services provided, not in terms of the costs of those services. But it seems more likely that individuals do consider the cost of services since Medicaid is contrasted with either no insurance or private insurance, both of which will be more costly as medical costs are higher. Second, this measure captures not only price variation but also variation in utiliziation of services by the Medicaid population. But utilization variation may also capture the quality of the Medicaid program, e.g., by representing the ease with which Medicaid patients can see providers in those states. In any case, the results are very similar if researchers do not use this deflator and instead simply use national average expenditures to form their measure.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~One practical problem with the Medicaid coverage computation approach, however, is that income is endogenous on the savings/consumption decision: income depends directly on savings through capital income receipt; labor supply may be changing as a result of efforts to qualify for Medicaid; and changes in private insurance coverage that result from becoming eligible may be reflected in wages (to the extent that the employer costs of insurance are shifted to wages) as well as in savings. As a result, researchers actually estimate the models by instrumental variables, where the instrument SIMMED(j) is defined as SIMMED(j) = [SUMM](i)SIMMELIG(i) X SPEND(i).
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~SIMMED~…researchers estimate their models by instrumental variables, where the instrumental SIMMED(j) is defined as SIMMED(j) = [SUMM](i)[SIMELIG](i) X SPEND(i).
394~D3, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~SIMELIG~The variable SIMELIG is formed by imputing to each potentially eligible woman or child a likelihood of Medicaid receipt that is based only on purely exogenous characteristics that are correlated with their eligibility: the education of the household head (for children) or of the woman, the age of the child, state of residence, and year. The last three of these criteria are directly related to the dimensions of legislative variation in Medicaid policy.
394~D1, D2~V20~Variable~Education~…an exogenous characteristic correlated with an individual's Medicaid eligibility. The firs of these criteria, education, serves as an exogenous proxy for income. Researchers use four education categories.
394~D1, D2~V21~Variable~Age of Child~…an exogenous characteristic correlated with an individual's Medicaid eligibility. The last three of these criteria are directly related to the dimensions of legislative variation in Medicaid policy.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~V4~Variable~State~…an exogenous characteristic correlated with an individual's Medicaid eligibility. The last three of these criteria are directly related to the dimensions of legislative variation in Medicaid policy.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~V22~Variable~Year~…an exogenous characteristic correlated with an individual's Medicaid eligibility. The last three of these criteria are directly related to the dimensions of legislative variation in Medicaid policy.
394~V20~L1~Variable Value~Less Than High School~…one of four education categories used in the current research.

394~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Education/Age/State/Year Cell~The imputation strategy is to measure the average eligibility rate in a given education/age/state/year cell.
394~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~The imputation strategy is to measure the average eligibility rate in a given education/age/state/year cell using data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS), and then to asign that average eligibility to all persons in that cell in both the SIPP and CEX. Researchers first select from the CPS for each year a national random samples of children of each age and of women of childbearing age, in each of the four education categories. Researchers then compute the eligibility of each person in this same sample, for each state's rules in that year. Researchers then measure the average eligiblity in each education/age/state cell to get a cell-specific eligibility measure. By using a nationally representative sample instead of a state-specific sample, researchers avoid any problems of correlations between state-specific dmeographic characteristics that determine eligibility and the savings/consumption behavior of residents of that state. In essence, this is a convenient parameterization of the rules of each state, as applied to the typical persons in an education/age group cell.
394~D3, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Eligibility Rate~The imputation strategy is to measure the average eligibility rate in a given education/age/state/year cell using data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS), and then to asign that average eligibility to all persons in that cell in both the SIPP and CEX.

In essence, this is a convenient parameterization of the rules of each state, as applied to the typical persons in an education/age group cell.
394~D4~D4~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Researchers use the CPS, and not the SIPP or CEX, for the imputation step of the analysis since the larger sample sizes guarantee a sufficient sample in each cell. Since reserachers are simply imputing averages by cell, researhers can easily estimate the averages in the CPS and then carry them over to these other data sets. This also has the virtue that researchers use the same Medicaid eligibility construct in both the CEX and the SIPP.
394~D3, D4~DV13~Derived Variable~Eligibility Rate~…suppose that high school dropouts in Alabama have particularly low incomes (and therefore low savings), relative to high school dropouts elsewhere and relative to other education groups in Alabama. If researchers used the actual sample of high school dropouts in Alabama, researchers would assign them a high fraction eligible on the basis of their low incomes. Researchers would then find a spurious negative association between eligibility and savins since they also have low savings. By using a nationally representative sample, researchers avoid this problem since  researchers are using only the laws of Alabama, and not the characteristics of its residents, to impute eligibility. It is worth noting that researchers carry out this exercise quarterly to account for within-year variation in the timing of the expansions, and that reserachers then match to the precise quarterly timing of the SIPP and SEX.
394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~Table 3 presents Medicaid eligible dollars over time.

394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~The time trends in (simulated) Medicaid eligible dollars for the SIPP and CEX samples are shown in columns 1 and 4 of table 3.
394~D3, D4~F3~Findings~Medicaid Elgible Dollars Over the 1984-1993 Period~The pattern in Medicaid eligible dollars is very similar across the two data sets: Medicaid eligible dollars roughly double over the 1984-93 period.
394~D2~D2~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The relevant CEX sample starts one year earlier than the interest period from 1984-93, as noted above.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~T6~Time Period~1984-1993~…survey period from which trends in Medicaid eligible dollars are followed throughout the 1984-1993 period.
394~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~There are no SIPP data for the years 1989, 1990, and 1992 since there was no survey in 1988 or 1989, and both the 1990 and 1991 wealth interviews took place during 1992.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~T6~Time Period~1984-1993~There are no SIPP data for the years 1989, 1990, and 1992 since there was no survey in 1988 or 1989, and both the 1990 and 1991 wealth interviews took place during 1992.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~Current eligibility for Medicaid is not the sole determinant of savings and consumption decisions, however: what is relevant is the entire future path of Medicaid eligibility. That is, consider two families that are living at the poverty line, in a state that has just expanded elibiilty for children under age 6 to 133% of poverty. The first family has one child who is age 5, and the second has one child who is age 1. The effect on the savings and consumption of the second family will be much larger than on those of the first family since they face more years of educated risk of medical expenditure.
394~DV5~L6~Variable Value~Future~…a created measure of expected future Medicaid eligible dollars (both actual and, as an instrument, simulated). For projecting future eligibility, researchers assume static expectations over the evolution of Medicaid policy; that is, researchers assume that individuals assess the eligibily of their family members if today's law remains in place into the infinite future. The family traces out the eligibility of a given family member as that member ages, within the constrains of today's eligibility of children of different ages (and pregant women). Researchers then discount future Medicaid eligibility dollars back to the present at a real interest rate of 6%.
394~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Income and Program Participation~The SIPP sample did not contain observations from 1983, 1989, 1990, or 1992; thus these observation years are missing in the analysis.
394~D3, D4~F4~Findings~Current vs. Future Medicaid Eligibility~Overall, Medicaid makes much more spending eligible in the future than it does today, as shown in table 3. The amount of future Medicaid dollars eligible is roughly five times the amount of current dollars eligible, although the time pattern is similar. Once again, the time patterns across the SIPP and CEX samples are very close.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~In the basic regression formulation, the Medicaid eligible dollars regressor (and instrument) is the sum of current dollars eligible (over the past year) and future dollars eligible, as shown in columns 3 and 6 of table 3.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The basic regression specification is OLS where A(j) is household net worth or consumption, MED(J) is the sum of current and future Medicaid eligible dollars, EDCAT(j) is the education categories used to match Medicaid eligibility, DEMOG(j) is a set of controls for family demographic structure, X(j) is an additional set of household-level covariates, [delta](s) is a full set of state dummies, and [tau](t) is a full set of time dummies.

394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The dependent variable for this analysis is a measure of household total net worth, or consumption in the CEX. Wealth holdings are very skewed, as researchers show in table 4: 23% of the sample has net worth of less than or equal to zero; the median net worth in the sample is $11,171, and the mean is $46,951. As a result, researchers use the log of wealth (or consumption) as the dependent variable. This raises the problem, however, that there may be sample selection bias to estimates based solely on positive wealth observations.

394~D1, D3, D4~F5~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility, Positive Wealth Holdings, and the Size of this Relationship~…there is a significant relationship between Medicaid eligibiilty and positive wealth holdings. But researchers argue that the size of this relationship cannot explain much of the very large crowd-out that researchers find in the log wealth models.
394~D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Consumption~…sample selection is not a problem for the consumption models since there are no observation with zero consumption. Thus the confirmation of the basic conclusions in the consumption data illustrates that the wealth results are not driven by selection.

394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~The instrumented regressor, Medicaid eligible dollars, varies along four dimensions: education, state, year, and family structure (age and number of children and age of woman).

394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~…researchers are concerned that Medicaid policy may be correlated with other policies that affect savings across different states and years, such as changes in the AFDC program. Even after the Medicaid expansions, a key determinant of Medicaid eligibility for some groups (older children and nonpregnant women) is AFDC policy. And AFDC may have independent effects on savings decisions, through the income effects of this cash transfer and through the relatively low level of asset testing.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV17~Derived Variable~State X Year~"…researchers are concerned that Medicaid policy may be correlated with other policies that affect savings across different states and years, such as changes in the AFDC program. Even after the Medicaid expansions, a key determinant of Medicaid eligibility for some groups (older children and nonpregnant women) is AFDC policy. And AFDC may have independent effects on savings decisions, through the income effects of this cash transfer and through the relatively low level of asset testing. Fortunately, researchers can address this possibility directly in the regression specification, by including a full set of state X year interactions. The AFDC policy varies only within staets over time, so this will absorb any omitted correlation with AFDC generosity. But the current model is identified even when these interactions are included because the ""age notches"" in Medicaid eligibility for children provide within-state/year variation in eligibility; state expansions cover some age ranges of children and not others. That is, researchers control for general changes in state Medicaid (and possibly other program) policies over time and identify the effects by the differential effects of these changes on different family structures."

394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Given the set of controls, the estimates of the effect of Medicaid are identifed only through interactions of education, state, year, and family structure (but not through state X year interactions). It seems reasonable that these interactions are excluded from equation (2).

394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The CEX regressions follow essentially the same specification, with the log of consumption spending used as the dependent variable. To control for seasonality in consumption, researchers include in their regressions a full set of dummies for the months contained in the four sets of interviews; if the family was interviewed for four quarters, all the month dummies will take on a value of one. Researchers also include a set of dummy variables for the number of interviews for that family.

394~D1, D3~F7~Findings~Negative and Significant Effect of Medicaid in the SIPP~In the SIPP analysis, researchers find a negative and highly significant effect of Medicaid in both specifications. For each $1,000 increase in Medicaid eligible dollars, there is a fall of 0.81% in the odds of having positive assets. Conditional on there being positive net wealth, researchers find that for each $1,000 of Medicaid eligible dollars, wealth holdings fall by 2.51%. These findings demonstrate that the Medicaid program has a sizable effect on savings behavior, which is consistent with a precautionary savings response to reduced risk of medical expenditure.
394~D1, D3, D4~F8~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Probability of High Wealth Holdings~Among those eligible for the Medicaid program, the average of Medicaid eligible dollars is $5,111. Thus, for this population, there is a reduction in the odds of having positive net worth of 4.2% and a reduction in net worth holdings of 12.8%. As an approximation, assume that those individuals who move from positive to zero net worth holdings would have otherwise had the median level of wealth among eligible positive wealth holders. This implies that the total reduction in net worth holdings due to Medicaid, if one accounts for individuals who reduce their wealth to zero, is 16.3%. Moreover, under the same assumption, researchers find that the expansions from 1984 to 1993 lowered wealth holdings among this population by 7.2%. These are fairly sizable effects.
394~D1, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Asset Holdings of the Eligible Population~The asset holdings of the eligible population in 1993 amounted to only 8.1% of the total asset holdings of the current sample, despite the fact that this group is over 32% of the sample, because the mean net worth of eligibles is only one-quarter of the sample average. Thus the 16.3% reduction in net worth holdings for this group translates to only 1.3% reduction in aggregate net worth holdings.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…one potential concern with the results is sample selection since researchers are using only positive wealth observations in their log wealth models. If those moving from positive to zero savings were disproportionately high savers (above the mean for the sample), a negative effect on savings in the remaining sample would automatically be induced. But the small LPM coefficients make this unlikey.
394~D1, D3, D4~F10~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Saving Propensity~…given that researchers find a reduction in the odds of being a positive saver of only 4.2%, researchers would require that those who move from being a positive saver to a nonpositive saver had wealth holdings, on average, of more than $44,000 for selection to explain the findings. It seems highly unlikely that Medicaid could be causing a reduction in wealth from more than $44,000 to zero, since for this population Medicaid eligible dollars average only $5,111.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~F11~Findings~Covariate Effects~The covariates have their expected effects. Wealth rises with age, is higher for whites and lower for blacks (relative to other non-whites) and female heads, and rises with education and marital status. These effects are all highly significant.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Evaluating the effects in dollar terms requires recognizing that the population that is affected by Medicaid is not representative of the full sample. In particular, given the skewed nature of wealth holdings, it is inappropriate to use the samplewide summary statistics from table 4. Moreover, summary statistics from the entire sample period incorporate the effects of the Medicaid expansions themselves, so that using them to evaluate the estimates would yield misleading results.

394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~Researchers evaluate their estimates using only the 1984 sample before Medicaid had expanded eligibility. For this sample, reserachers compute actual eligibility for Medicaid, under both 1984 rules and 1993 rules, in the latter case inflating family income to 1993 levels. Researchers the compute Medicaid eligible dollars for eligible families, under both 1984 and 1993 rules; eligible families are defined as families in which any member is eligible. Finally, researchers compute the weighted means of wealth only for the populations eligible in 1984 and 1993, where the weights are Medicaid eligible dollars. This weighted means both is focused on the appropriate (eligible) population and places more weight on the families that are most affected by Medicaid policy.
394~D1~DV19~Derived Variable~Weighted Means of Wealth~Researchers evaluate their estimates using only the 1984 sample before Medicaid had expanded eligibility. For this sample, reserachers compute actual eligibility for Medicaid, under both 1984 rules and 1993 rules, in the latter case inflating family income to 1993 levels. Researchers the compute Medicaid eligible dollars for eligible families, under both 1984 and 1993 rules; eligible families are defined as families in which any member is eligible. Finally, researchers compute the weighted means of wealth only for the populations eligible in 1984 and 1993, where the weights are Medicaid eligible dollars. This weighted means both is focused on the appropriate (eligible) population and places more weight on the families that are most affected by Medicaid policy.
394~D1, D3, D4~F12~Findings~Medicaid Coverage and Asset Holdings~…it is found that the Medicaid program lowers asset holdings by between 25 and 32 cents for each dollar of eligibility. The first of these figures uses just the log wealth coefficient, and the second incorporates the LPM effect as well, assuming that individuals who become nonpositive savers would have otherwise had the median positive level of savings. This implies that, among the eligible population, Medicaid lowered wealth holdings by between $1,293 and $1,645 in 1993 and that the expansions from 1984 to 1993 lowered wealth holdings by between $567 and $722.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Researchers therefore explore the role of asset tests in table 6 by estimating models with a dummy for whether the state has an asset test, interacted with Medicaid dollars. There is no dummy for the presence of an asset test per se since the asset test regime varies only by state and year, so that this is absorbed by the set of state X year dummies. Regressions include the set of covariates listed in table 5 and the note to that table. Models are estimated by instrumental variables where MED is instrumented by SIMMED. Standard errors are in parentheses.
394~D1, D3, D4~F13~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Asset Tests~Researchers find that there is a negative interaction of eligibility with the presence of an asset test in columns 1 and 2, where wealth holdings are the dependent variable. For the regression for having positive assets, the interaction is marginally significant: it indicates that having an asset test raises the effect of a $1,000 increase in Medicaid eligible dollars from 0.78% to only 0.93%. For the log wealth regression, however, the interaction is highly significant and sizable; indeed, it is actually larger than the main effect on Medicaid eligible dollars. This indicates that for each $1,000 in Medicaid eligible dollars, there is only a 1.81% reduction in assets if there is no asset test in place, but there is a 4.37% reduction if there is an asset test in place. That is, having an asset test in place more than doubles the wealth reduction attributable to expanding Medicaid eligibility. This pattern of effects should not be surprising: there should be much less effect of an asset test (at some positive level) on the odds of saving at all than on the amount of savings that are accumulated. Thus the current findings are consistent with the view that asset tests exacerbate the negative savings impact of the expansions by inducing wealth reductions in the population that is newly eligible on income grounds, but not on asset grounds.
394~D3, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Medicaid Eligibility~…Medicaid eligibility is predicted to have two positive effects on consumption: reduced precautionary savings and redistribution. 
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Researchers explore the effect of Medicaid eligibiity on measured consumption expenditures by returning to column 3 of table 5. Reseachers show their basic specifications, with the log of nondurable nonmedical expenditures as the dependent variable. As above, these regressions include not only the covariates shown in the table but also a full set of controls for ages of children/wives and full sets of dummies for states, years, and state X year interactions.
394~D1, D2~V25~Variable~Age of Spouse~…a set of controls for the ages of wives.
394~D2, D3, D4~F14~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Consumption~Researchers find a highly significant positive effect of Medicaid eligibility on consumption, which is consistent with the negative effects on wealth holdings documented above. Researchers estimate that for each $1,000 in eligibility, nondurable expenditures rise by 0.82%. For the eligible population in 1993, this estimate implies that their consumption was 4.2% higher as a result of Medicaid eligibility.
394~D2, D3, D4~F15~Findings~Medicaid Eligibility and Consumption (in dollars)~…in evaluating the effect of Medicaid eligibility on consumption, it is of interest to evaluate these effects in terms of dollars of increased consumption from the Medicaid expansions. Following the same proceudre as before, researchers find that in 1993, Medicaid raised the consumption of eligible families by $538. This effect is 33-42% as large as the effect on wealth holdings, which is consistent with the fact that the reduction in the stock of wealth is the cumulation of the flow effects of increased consumption. Comparing the precise magnitudes of the wealth and consumption effects is difficult and requires na underlying model of the accumulation process. Nevertheless, these findings confirm the basic results from the wealth data: Medicaid raises consumption and lowers savings.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Researchers explore the roll of asset tests in the data in column 3 of table 6. Once again, researchers use as the key regressors. Medicaid dollars and an interaction of Medicaid dollars with a dummy for the presence of an asset test.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~F16~Findings~Roll of Asset Tests, Medicaid Eligibility, Consumption and Savings Propensity~In examining the roll of asset tests in the data in column 3 of table 6, researchers once again find strong evidence with these consumption data for the proposition that Medicaid expansions reduce savings more when there is an asset test in place. The interaction coefficient is significant and roughly equal to the main effect on Medicaid dollars, indicating (as before) that the presence of an asset test doubles the consumption increases from expanded Medicaid elibility. Taken together with the evidence for wealth holdings, these findings support the contention of Hubbard et al. (1995) that asset tests are an important determinant of savings (and consumption) behavior.
394~D3~DV9~Derived Variable~Medicaid Coverage~Theoretical advances in modeling precautionary savings over the past decade have raised the possibility that social insurance programs play an important role in determining both the level and distribution of asset holdings in the United States.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~F17~Findings~Parameters of the Medicaid Program, Savings Behavior, and Response to Asset Testing~The current results confirm that the parameters of the Medicaid program are a major determinant of the savings behavior of low-income households. Researchers also confirm that households respond to asset testing on becoming eligible for Medicaid; eligibility has a much larger negative effect on savings if there is an asset test in plae. On net, researchers find that in 1993 the Medicaid program lowered the wealth holdings of eligible households by 16.3%. Researchers also find that the expansions of this program over the 1984-93 period lowered wealth holdings by 7.2%. Perhaps most important, researchers confirm that Medicaid lowers savings and raises consumption in two different sources of data. These findings therefore offer strong empirical support to the contention of Hubbard et al. (1995) that social insurance programs contribute to the skewed distribution of assets in the United States by lowering the savings of eligible low-income households.
394~D1, D2, D3, D4~F18~Findings~Cautionary Implications of SIPs as the Sole Explanation for the Level and Distribution of U.S. Wealth Holdings~…the findings offer some caution for the use of social insurance programs alone as an explanation for the level and distribution of U.S. wealth holdings. In aggregate, researchers estiamte only a very small effect of Medicaid on asset holdings. Moreover, while the findings can explain some of the low asset holdings at the very bottom of the income distribution, there remains considerable skewness throughout the distribution (e.g., among those families above 200% of the poverty line) that cannot be explained by this or other means-tested programs. Of course, it is possible that means tested social insurance can affect savings of higher-income households since these families may eventually become poor enough to qualify.
398~398: NAFTA: Lessons from an Uneven Integration~~~~
398~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~V1~Variable~NAFTA~The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was the first free trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and a developing country, and it was the cmost ambitious anywhere in the world among countries with such extreme differences in income and development but with a geographical proximity that allows integration to take place beyond the trade factor. It could be argued that, more than a trade agreement, NAFTA is a pathway to regional integration. It could provide, therefore, an opportunity to understand the relationship between efficiency impacts on sector output and employment, the growth rates of national income and productivity, and the distribution of income within and among countries.
398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~V1~Variable~NAFTA~Ten years after its enactment, the whol region has undergone a transformation: new and larger linkages have emerged in goods and services production, there has been reallocation of production capacities, and labor markets have become more integrated. No other region in the world has witnessed such a transformation; indeed, one of the largest migration processes in world history has taken place between Mexico and the United States.
398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~V1~Variable~NAFTA~Although debate was broader in scope, most of the literature on NAFT has centered on how trade adjusted to the new tariff scenario and how this affected employment. Little has been discussed about factor mobility and how the latter has reshaped the whole North American economy. The assumptions of the different models can be summarized as follows: tariff reduction and obstacles removal were going to increase intraregional exports and enhance investment flows across countries, with positive effects on production and employment.
398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~V1~Variable~NAFTA~It was expected that there would be a positive intraregional growth in exports of all three economies, with the most competitive sectors becoming the leaders. This path could be depicted as follows: [delta]X(ij)>0 where I and j are Canada, Mexico, or the United States, with i =/= j; and X is exports. Intraregional export growth was going to bring an increase in intraregional investment, mainly in the export sectors, thereby modernizing productive capacities, primarily in Mexico, through the introduction of new technologies: [delta]ln(v(ij))/[delta]X(ij) > 0 where lnv represents investment in a country. Increased investment was going to bring about positive effects on production (GDP): [delta]GDP(ij)/[delta]ln(v)(ij) > 0. Increased production and economies of scale were expected to have a positive impact on employment: [delta]E(ij)/[delta]GDP(ij) > 0. All of these effects could be summarized in an elementary diagram (Figure 1), where it is shown how exports could create a positive cumulative effect on the rest of the economy.

Relocation could not be avoided in the global economy, as multinational corporations are willing to take advantage of economies of sclae wherever they exist. Hence, if they are inside NAFTA, they will reallocate their investment within the region but will also continually monitor the options worldwide of investing wherever it is more profitable. The consequence of this strategic investment planning has been to create a very competitive environment in the region, as all investments are evaluated constantly in order to assess their competitive edge. During the period 1994-2003, there was a positive evaluation of the NAFTA region by multinational corporations that led to an overall increase in investment flows and to a significant reshaping of productive capacities within the region.

398~D7~DV2~Derived Variable~Investment in a Country~Capital flows were bidirectional. U.S. investment more than doubled in Canada, and there was almost a fourfold increase in Mexico,  while flows from Mexico and Canada more than doubled their investment positive in the United States (see Table 2).
398~V7~L1~Variable Value~Manufacturing~The restructuring of manufacturing under NAFTA led to a change in the trade pattern within the region that resulted not only from the increased integration but also from the emergence of new relations among producers. Clustering emerged in the region as a way to improve competitiveness. The largest of these clusters was the auto industry, where strong linkages developed among producers. Thereby, autos became the most traded good and constituted one-fourth of total trade of the region. the logic behind this clustering was to take advantage of economies of scale within the region, with low-end products to be produced in the south and high-tech inputs to be devloped in the north. Specialization through clustering led to a learning process in the value chain, with low-end producers developing new skills that helped them to upgrade and enter some new activities. This was the case with auto parts manufacturers in the automative industry. This allowed Mexico to come into the high-tech part of the industry, with the development of research facilities, as in the case of Delphi, which became the second-largest employer in the country.
398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~T2~Time Period~1992-2003~The arithmetic of NAFTA became more complex, as is reflected in the evolution of the U.S. balance of payments, where the U.S. deficit with the rest of the region rose from a low of $5 billion in 1992 to $96 billion in 2003, and the overall current account deficit grew from $13 billion in 1992 to $53 billion, constituting 3% of the global U.S. deficit in 1994 and 10% in 2003. In this case, the deficit was the result of the relocation of plants to Mexico and Canada. However, this does not mean that the United States was somehow becoming less competitive. Rather, it would appear that U.S. companies were taking advantage of free trade in order to benefit from greater economies of scale within the region, not only in the U.S. territory. This was an unexpected outcome of integration, and it contradicts the surplus hypothesis of the initial models put forth by trade analysts, as the latter were considering trade without factor mobility and clustering. Once one incorporates both factors into the analysis, it becomes clear that success cannot be measured by a single variable, as clustering is mainly an interactive process with multiple outcomes. Consequently, changes in patterns of trade resulted not simply from the tariff reduction but from a more complex process, whereby investment flows and relocation of capacities become the determinants of trade flows.

While Mexico reduced its growth rate from 3.4% to 2.8%, this uneven result shows that external forces do not have the same effect on different sizes of economies, and that growth requires a domestic component to take advantage of the new environment characterized by greater foreign direct investment trade. The missing link was the lack of investment growth in Mexico, necessary in order to take advantage of the new investment opportunities that accompanies liberalization.

The second largest job-creating activity was trade, with 3.2 million new jobs, due mainly to the boom in retail trade throughout the whole region. The third activity was health care and social assistance (with 3 million new jobs), a sector that is becoming increasingly important, as there is a rising demand for health services to attend people at home or in nursing institutions. Expectations are that demand in this area will continue to increase. The fourth activity was public administration (2.2 million new jobs), with growth that comes mainly from the restructuring of the public sector in the United States, where regional and local governments have become more important in the delivery of public services. New niches of employment also emerged in the accomodation and food services industry (2 million), as new outdoor activities are on the rise in North America, and in educational services (1 million), where there is an increasing demand for new professionals in lifelong training for a more mature society.

398~V7~L11~Variable Value~Trade~The service-producing sector was the leader in job creation under NAFTA. The second largest job-creating activity was trade, with 3.2 million new jobs, due mainly to the boom in retail trade throughout the whole region.
398~V7~L19~Variable Value~Health Care and Social Assistance~The service-producing sector was the leader in job creation under NAFTA. The third activity was health care and social assistance (with 3 million new jobs), a sector that is becoming increasingly important, as there is a rising demand for health services to attend people at home or in nursing institutions. Expectations are that demand in this area will continue to increase.
398~V7~L23~Variable Value~Public Administration~The service-producing sector was the leader in job creation under NAFTA. The fourth activity was public administration (2.2 million new jobs), with growth that comes mainly from the restructuring of the public sector in the United States, where regional and local governments have become more important in the delivery of public services.
398~V7~L21~Variable Value~Accomodation and Food Services~The service-producing sector was the leader in job creation under NAFTA. New niches of employment also emerged in the accomodation and food services industry (2 million), as new outdoor activities are on the rise in North America, and in educational services (1 million), where there is an increasing demand for new professionals in lifelong training for a more mature society.

398~D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Employment Growth~One of the main problems arising from the new integration process has been the incapacity of Mexico to create paid employment. During the period from 1994 to 2002, the labor force increased by 1.3 million a year, while total remunerated employment growth averaged 533,000 per year. This huge gap has been filled by informal markets and migration, resulting in a deteriorating social environment. One positive aspect of this imbalance has been the strength of labor market growth in the United States, at a rate of 1.7 million new jobs per annum. These new U.S. jobs have been absorbing an increasing number of migrants, mainly from Mexico.

398~D2~DV8~Derived Variable~Employment Growth~Leading export sectors in the United States, Canada, and Mexico were not, however, the ones to stimulate overall employment; their contribution ws marginal. Of the total of new jobs created, the leading sectors share was only 2.81% in the United States, 0.77% in Mexico, and 20.51% in Canada. In fact, in some of these sectors, the impact on job creation has been negative, mainly in Mexico (primary metal industries, industrial machinery and equipment, leather and leather products, food and kindred products, chemicals, and allid products, fabricated metal products, and stone, clay, and glass products) and the United States (paper, chemicals, farms, and transportation).

398~D2, D5, D8~V7~Variable~Industry~In Mexico, the leading export sectors underwent some restructuring, as in the glass and primary metal industries; while, in the United States, the chemical industry suffered the new technologies syndrome, and the lumber industry is one of those traditional sectors that had not been able to modernize.
398~D2, D5, D8~V7~Variable~Industry~What is clear from the comparison of job creation is that the sectors creating additional jobs were outside of the new export industries. Therefore, it could be argued that these export sectors are not labor intensive, as was assummed in the original NAFTA debates.
398~D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Wage Growth~Canada and Mexico maintained a policy of competitiveness via low wage growth. This is a self-defeating strategy, as it weakens one's domestic market and does not allow capacities for taking advantage of economies of scale, which was one fo the main issues in the NAFTA debates. This led to a process in which markets and macro policies act against one another, instead of reinforcing the integration process. One hypothesis here is that these divergent paths derive from labor market behavior: Canada and Mexico have been pushing integration based on low wage policy, while the United States has had an innovation policy that encourages real wage growth. NAFTA faces, therefore, the prevalence of two competitiveness paradigms, one based on low cost and the other based on innovation. Because the first option is self-defeating, in the long run, the only viable competitiveness strategy among partners will be through innovation.

398~D1~D1~Dataset~U.S. Justice Department~Data from the U.S. Justice Department show that during the period 1989-2001, approximately 14 million persons migrated to the United States, of which 3.7 million came from Mexico and 360,000 from Canada. Migration to the United States from its NAFTA partners accounted for about 10% of the U.S. population increase during the period between 1989 and 2002. The NAFTA debates avoide the thorny issue of migration, as it was expected that as trade would increase, domestic production would expand and would generate greater employment opportunities and better conditions internally, thereby creating disincentives for people to emigrate from their homelands. Low growth of output and employment has led to diminished expectations in Mexico, thus favoring greater immigration to the United States and Canada.

398~V8~L30~Variable Value~Emigration~Although lowering social pressures in the short run, emigration represents a loss of human capital, leading to a reduction of potential output in the home country. This hypothesis is based on the well-known theory of human capital (Mankiw, Phelps, and Romer 1995), where growth ([Delta]Y) is postulated to be a function of both physical capital accumulation (K(p)) and human capital (K(h)), as expressed in the following formula: [Delta]Y = ([Delta]Kh, [Delta]Kp).

398~D5, D7, D8~DV11~Derived Variable~Output Growth~If researchers extend the analysis to two open economies, growth will be determined not only by domestic human and physical capital but also by migration. Hence, migration would be positive for the host economy or country of immigration (i) and negative for the home economy or country of emigration (e), as shown here: Y(i) = f(Kh, Kp, +[Omega]), Y(e) = f(Kh, Kp, -[Omega])
398~D1, D9~V8~Variable~Migration~Human capital mobility allows a GDP exchange among both economies, as the economy with emigration will face a reduced level of production (lost product), while the host economy will increase its GDP (earned product). This model allows researchers to introduce migration as an important factor in the determination of macroeconomic performance (the evolution of GDP), thereby broadening the microanalysis that has been developed around migration (Zimmermand and Bauer 2002).

398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~F2~Findings~Policy Recommendations~Policy recommendations based on this new type of anlysis bring forth the need to formulate macroeconomic policies in an environment in which migration is important. This is due to the simple fact that the host economy increases its output largely at the expense of the home economy. Long-term discussion has to involve these redistributive implications, perhaps along the lines as found in the European Union, where, at least, it has been recognized that compensatory transfers are required in order to improve living conditions in the migrant countries (Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece) and, by doing so, reduced emigration. Hence, it could be argued that the acceptance of intercountry transfers is a recognition of the positive effects of migration on countries with low population growth.
398~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10~F3~Findings~Innovation and General Strategy Discussion~The optimistic expectations that NAFTA would have created a virtuous circle of increased production and employment have not been fulfilled. Canada and the United States were unable to pull the Mexican economy onto the same growth path, because the multiplier effects of the export sectors are much lower than expected in the less developed areas of North America. there are no clear-cut linkages that could really develop a network of growth, and there are no policies in the region that attempt to develop them. Emphasis has been given to enhance the so-called competitiveness edge via two different approaches. For the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada, the competitiveness edge has largely been an innovation approach, while in Mexico, it has essentially been a cost approach. Prevalence of these two different approaches to competiveness reduces the possibility of a smooth pathway to further integration, as the first encourages human capital development, while the other is based on a low wage policy. If the objective is further integration, there must be a change toward an innovation strategy that emphasizes the idea that the only long-term solution to further integration is the creation of a knowledge-based region where all participants would be able to improve their standard of living. Innovation revalues the role of human capital in the development process and introduces the idea of high-quality jobs.
398~D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~F4~Findings~Factor Mobility's Affect on Growth~Agreement must be reached on how factor mobility affects growth. A larger role needs to be accorded to this anlysis due to the fact that capital and labor mobility has increased tremendously during the last decade, but little importance has been given to its impact. In fact, higher growth has been the result of factor mobility. U.S. output is 10% larger thanks to the migration effect, while Mexico has suffered a loss of about 30% of its pre-emigration potential output. All of these effects need to be discussed in a systematic way, so as to reach a consensus on how different factors can be combined to identify a policy mix that could generate more balanced growth within the whole region.
398~D2, D5, D8~F5~Findings~The Burden of Adjustment and Disequilibrium Among Sectors~The burden of adjustment has fallen on labor markets. Disequilibrium among sectors has been resolved through employment reduction, and when factor mobility is considered, migration has turned out to be the main mechanism of adjustment. Trade liberalization and the free trade agreement have proven to be insufficient to enhance economic performance, even with capital mobility within region. What has now become clear is that external factors could help; but, as far as there are not endogenous forces that could reinforce growth, external factors will not solve the long-term problems faced by these economies. What has also become evident from the analysis is that market adjustment alone will not lead to full employment of existing resources. Adjustment requires public action to coordinate the effor. For that purpose, there has to be public recognition that the three countries have to develop an institutional framework so as to discuss long-term problems based on strategic planning.

399~399: The Measured Black-White Wage Gap among Women Is Too Small~~~~
399~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~Although the wages of black women have fallen relative to those of white women over the past two decades, black-white wage gaps among working women remain quite small compared to the corresponding gaps among men. Further, a substantial literature concludes that black-white gaps in potential wages among men are likely much larger in absolute value than the observed gaps in measured wages. Among college-educated women, the black-white wage ratio in the 1980 census is 1.13. The comparable figure from the 1980 March CPS is 1.02. The sample used for these calculations includes women aged 25-64.
399~D2, D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Employment Rates~The employment rates of black men relative to white men fell throughout the 1970s and 1980s and numerous studies indicate that racial differences in selection bias generated measured wage gaps that overstate the relative economic standing of black men.
399~D2~V1~Variable~Labor Force Participation Rates~…labor force participation rates for black and white women have been quite similar for decades, and this fact underlies the commonly held view that selection bias does not contaminate measured black-white wage gaps among women.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~Taken as a whole, the literature on black-white wage inequality suggests that racial gaps in potential wages are much larger among men than among women and, futher, that one can accurately assess black-white gaps in potential wages among women without accounting for black-white differences in patterns of female labor supply.
399~D2~V1~Variable~Labor Force Participation Rates~…even though participation rates are the same among black and white women, selection bias is still an important concern when one is estimating black-white gaps in potential wages because relationships between labor force participation and family structure differ notably by race. Married women who are raising children account for a disproportionate share of white women who do not work in the market, and a noteworthy number of these women are married to men who earn relatively high incomes. One might suspect that the decision by these women to work at home does not necessarily reflect low wage offers but rather high shadow prices of time spent at home. On the other hand, single mothers are overrepresented in the sample of black women who do not report any market work, and a significant fraction of black, single mothers who do not work in the market over multiyear periods are receiving means-tested government assistance in some form. Such programs are not attractive options for women who can command high wages for market work, and it seems reasonable to conclude that these single mothers would earn relatively low wages if they chose market work. 
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~…relationships between family structures, income sources, and participation behavior suggest that standard measures of black-white wage gaps among women are likely contaminated by selection bias.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~In the analyses below, researchers provide several estimates of the black-white gap in potential wages for the year 1990 using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a panel data set that includes persons born between 1957 and 1964. The author exploits data on wages and income sources for years before and after 1990 to develop imputation methods that allow the author to adjust measures of the black-white wage gap among women for racial differences in selection patterns. These imputation rules yield a 1990 wage measure for at least 95% of both the black and white women in the NLSY sample, and the author's results suggest that selection bias does contaminate standard measures of black-white wage inequality among women.

399~D1, D2, D3~T1~Time Period~1990.0~…the author provides several estimates of the black-white gap in potential wages for the year 1990 using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
399~D1~T2~Time Period~1957-1964~…the NLSY is a panel data set that represents persons born between 1957 and 1964.
399~D1, D2, D3~F1~Findings~Median Log Wage Gaps~Among young adult employed women in 1990, the census, CPS, and NLSY data yield median log wage gaps of -.11, -.16, and -.18, respectively. These baseline differences among the samples highlight the potential impact of selection bias on these measured gaps. Because the NLSY contains more extensive questions about earnings and employment histories, it contains 1990 wage information for a larger fraction of the sample, and this difference in coverage appears to be a key reason that measured wage gaps are larger in the NLSY data. Further, even the -.18 gap in the NLSY appears to understate the true extent of black-white differences in labor market opportunities. On the basis of several different imputation procedures, the author estimates that the median black-white gap in log potential wages among women in the NLSY is approximately -.25. This gap is still smaller than the comparable gap among men, but it is almost 40% larger than the gap observed among women who report 1990 market gaps in the NLSY and more than twice as large as the baseline gap among women in census data.

399~D2~V1~Variable~Labor Force Participation Rates~Table 1 describes trends in two measures of labor force participation. Both measures are constructed using census data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata series. Columns 1 and 3 capture whether or not respondents were working or seeking employment at the time they completed the census form. The full-time, full-year category measures the fraction of women who usually worked at least 35 hours per week and also work at least 48 weeks in the previous calendar year.

399~D2~F2~Findings~Participation Rate Trends~…Table 1 shows that participation rates have risen over the years for both black and white women, and in 1990, participation rates among black women were quite similar to those of white women.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~The author uses data from the census, CPS, and NLSY to estimate the black-white gap in log median potential wages among young adult men in 1990.
399~D1, D2, D3~F3~Findings~Imputed Black-White Wage Gap in 1990~Using a common imputation method, the author finds that the estimated black-white wage gap among young adult men in 1990 varies between -.33 and -.37 among the three data sets. These estimates are comparable to other estimates in the literature.
399~D2~V1~Variable~Labor Force Participation Rates~Table 2 presents more detailed data on participation patterns for women.
399~D2~V2~Variable~Family Structure Rate~The entries in table 2 indicate the fraction of women of a given race and labor force status who occupy a particular family structure. If family structures had no impact on labor supply decisions, the prevalence of a given family structure among employed and nonemployed women would be the same, and the entries on the left-hand side of the table would match those on the right. However, family structures are related to labor force participation rates, and these relationships differ by race.
399~D2~F4~Findings~Economic and Demographic Characteristics of Blacks and Whites~In 1990 and other census years, 80% or more of white women aged 25-55 who are not in the labor force are married and over 60% are married with children. Further, the corresponding fractions of married women in the labor force are always smaller. Thus married women make up a disproportionate share of white women who do not engage in market work. However, this is not always true among black women. In 1980, married women made up 50% of the black female labor force but only 48% of black female nonparticipants. Also, among black women, the fraction of nonparticipants who were single mothers grew each decade, and by 1990, the modal nonparticipant in the black sample was a single mother. This trend in part reflects the fact that single motherhood among black women increased dramatically from 1960 to 1990. However, the fraction of participants who were single mothers did not rise as rapidly over this period. In both 1980 and 1990, single mothers are overrepresented in the samples of black women who do not work outside the home. In contast, white single mothers in 1980 and 1990 constitute 12% of the white female labor force and less than 10% of white women who are not seeking emploment.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~In NLSY data, most black, single mothers who do not work outside the home are, in fact, receiving means-tested government assistance in some form. Thus, even thought the overall participation rates for black and white owmen are quite similar in 1990, racial differences in the composition of thos who do not work suggest that measured racial wage gaps among women may still be contaminated by selection bias.
399~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~In the analyses of wages that follow, the author restricts attention to samples that include only black and white women. Samples from the 1990 census and March CPS include all women who were between 25 and 33 at the time of their census interviews. The NLSY sample includes persons born between 1957 and 1964. At the time of their 1990 NLSY interviews, they were aged 25-33 as well. The author includes persons from the NLSY oversample of blacks, but does not include persons from the supplemental samples of Hispanics, economically disadvantaged whites, or military personnel.

The NLSY sample should be nationally representative within race categories. 
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~The author used the NLSY data on grades completed and degrees received to compute an education variable that would closely mimic the coding of education in the 1990 census, and found that, within each race-gender cell, the NLSY and census data yields very similar average education levels.
399~D1, D2~V3~Variable~Education~The author used the NLSY data on grades completed and degrees received to compute an education variable that would closely mimic the coding of education in the 1990 census, and found that, within each race-gender cell, the NLSY and census data yields very similar average education levels.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~The respondents come from two portions of the NLSY: (i) a nationally representative cross-section sample and (ii) a supplemental sample of black respondents that is representative of the black population. Attrition rates in the NLSY are low, but as a robustness check, the author performed all the analyses for this paper using the 1990 sampling weights. The results are quite similar, but one must note that this weight is designed to adjust the 1990 samples, but not the samples constructed from multiple years. 
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~In the analyses presented here, the author uses the information on race and ethnicity in the NLSY to construct indicators for white and black that match those used in census data as closely as possible. Thus some of the white respondents from the NLSY are identified as Hispanic according to their sample identification numbers. Further, some persons who are nonblack and non-Hispanic according to their sample identification numbers are not classified as white because they also report being Asian, a separate race category in the 1990 census.

399~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Education Distributions Within Race-Gender Cells~"Although average education levels within race-gender cells are almost identical in the two data sets (NLSY and Census) the education distributions are not exactly the same. For both black and white women, the census data record fewer women with no postsecondary schooling. In census data, .50 of black women and .43 of white women fall in the high school or less category; the comparable figures are .59 and .54 in the NLSY. Part of this discrepancy may reflect the fact that, while the NLSY figures reflect grades completed, the census data record persons as ""some college"" if they have ever attended college, and this category may well include persons who have not completed even one year of postsecondary schooling. Rates of college completion are more similar in the two data sets."

399~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Fraction Working and Education Level~…in every Table 3 sample, the fraction working increases with education level. Further, this pattern is more pronounced among black women. While the fraction working among college-educated black women is over .9 in each of the three samples and always above the comparable rate for white women, the fraction working among black women with 12 years of schooling or less is only .57 in the census sample. This is well below the rate of .67 for white women in the same education group. Because education is an important observed determinant of wages, this pattern provides more evidence that selection patterns among white women differ in important ways from those observed among black women.
399~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Fraction Working and Race Across Data Samples~…in Table 3, note that the NLSY data provide more complete wage records. The fraction working is .71 among black women in the census but .79 among black women in the NLSY. The corresponding increase among white women is .78-.83. Thus, compared to figures from census data, rates of working in the NLSY are higher and racial differences in these rates are slightly smaller.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~The NLSY is a panel survey that, in each year, involves extensive questions concerning employment and work histories. The repeated nature of the survey and its more extensive treatment of employment issues and time use provide additional opportunties to gather information about jobs that may be seasonal, occasional, or part-time.

399~D1, D2, D3~F8~Findings~Wage Distribution Across Data Samples~…wage rates are generally higher in census data than in the NLSY or CPS. However, these differences are most striking among black workers. Whether measured by black-white ratios or black-white gaps in log wages, the NLSY data imply the highest levels of raial wage inequality among women. For example, the black-white wgae ratio in the NLSY is .82. The comparable figures from the census and CPS are .92 and .86, respectively. Part of the difference between the CPS and census results appears to reflect a measurement error problem in the census data that appears to be correlated with race. The black-white wage ratios among women who report working full-time and at least 48 weeks in the previous year are .89 and .88 in the census and CPS, respectively. Most of the difference in black-wage ratios between the census and CPS samples is driven by higher relative wages among black women who are not full-time, full-year workers. Black women who report working less than 35 hours per week in census data actually have higher implied horuly wages than their full-time, full-year counterparts.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Wages~The levels are not exactly comparable across datasets because the NLSY data refer to the most recent job as of the 1990 interview whereas the census data provide average wages in 1989. Some of the most recent jobs in the NLSY occurred in 1989, but, on average, the rwage rates in the NLSY refer to a later time period. Thus one expects a small bias toward higher wage levels in the NLSY.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV4~Derived Variable~Average Log Hourly Wages~The levels are not exactly comparable across datasets because the NLSY data refer to the most recent job as of the 1990 interview whereas the census data provide average wages in 1989.

Results concerning participation rates, mean wage gaps, and the wgae ratios are almost identical. Median black-white log wage gaps among women, based on 1988-92 data, are roughly .01 bigger in absolute value in a sample restricted to women with valid 1990 data. This is true with or without the use of various imputations.
399~D1~F9~Findings~Black-White Wage Ratio and Inequality in the 1990 and 1988-1992 Sample~The black-white wage ratio remains at .82 for the 1988-92 sample. However, the estimated black-white gap in log wages, which is -.17 in the 1990 NLSY sample, increases slightly in absolute value to .18. Given that the 1988-92 sample contains valid wages for over 90% of women regardless of race, one might conclude that -.18 must be a good approximation of the true black-white wage gap among women in the 25-33 age range. However, noteworthy racial differences in patterns of selection remain.
399~D1~F10~Findings~College-Educated Black Women and White Woman and Fraction of Cohort Working~…in the 1988-92 sample, college-educated black women are more likely to work than college-educated white women, whereas among women with no postsecondary schooling, black women are notably less likely to work than white women. 
399~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Average Predicted Log Wages~Panel C of table 5 provides one measures of the significant differences in black and white women partipation rates and educational attainment are. This table is similar to table 4, but the entires are average predicted log wages. The author regressed the log of average wages over the period 1988-92 on indicator variables for age and years of schooling. The author ran separate regressions by race and, on the basis of the estimated coefficients, constructed predicted log wages for all women in both black and white samples.
399~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~Panel C of table 5 provides one measures of the significant differences in black and white women partipation rates and educational attainment are. This table is similar to table 4, but the entires are average predicted log wages. The author regressed the log of average wages over the period 1988-92 on indicator variables for age and years of schooling. The author ran separate regressions by race and, on the basis of the estimated coefficients, constructed predicted log wages for all women in both black and white samples.
399~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~Overall Black-White Gap in Predicted Log Wages~The overall black-white gap in predicted log wages is -.19. This change is small but is in the expected direction.
399~D1~DV7~Derived Variable~Source of Income~Table 6 illustrates other black-white differences in patterns of selection that may be more important. The table provides descriptive statistics on sources of income for women. The statistics are presented separately by race, and the samples are divided according to whether or not women report market work. Statistics are presented for both 1990 and the 1988-92 period. 
399~D1~F12~Findings~Black Women Who Do and Do Not Participate~The contrast between black women who do and do not participate is striking. 10% of black women in the NLSY sample did not work between 1988 and 1992. Of these women, 78% received supplemental security income (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or food stamp payment in each year between 1988 and 1992. Among black women who worked at least once during this period, the corresponding number is .15. Further, black women who did not work over this period averaged 4.28 years of aid receipt. Among black women who did work over thisperiod, the corresponding average is only 1.33. The pattern is reversed with respect to receipt of spousal income. Among blackwomen who did not work from 1988 to 1992, only 4% were receiving spousal income in each year. The corresponding number is 15% among those who did work.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~Participants in 1990 are respondents who report a valid wage for the current or most recent job. Participants for the 1988-92 period must report a valid wage for this variable in ate least one of the survey years between 1988 and 1992. Nonparticipants for the 1988-92 period report that they have not worked since their last interview in each of their interviews between 1988 and 1992. Women who receive income from AFDC, SSI, or food stamps make p the recipients of the government aid category.
399~D1~V4~Variable~Years of Government Aid~…the years of government aid for NLSY respondents from 1988-1992.
399~D1~V5~Variable~Years of Spousal Income~…the years of spousal income for NLSY respondent from 1988-1992.
399~D1~DV8~Derived Variable~Fraction With Five Years of Aid~…the fraction with five years of aid for NLSY respondent from 1988-1992.
399~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Fraction With Five Years of Spousal Income~…the fraction with five years of spousal income for NLSY respondent from 1988-1992. 
399~D1~V6~Variable~Years of School~…the years of schooling for NLSY respondents from 1988-1992.
399~D1~F13~Findings~Aid Receipt, Fraction of Women Working, and the Black-White Wage Gap~Among black women who worked at least once during this period, the corresponding number is .15. Further, black women who did not work over this period averaged 4.28 years of aid receipt. Among black women who did work over this period, the corresponding is only 1.33. The pattern is reversed with respect to receipt of spousal income. Among black women who did not work from 1988 to 1992, only 4% were receiving spousal income in each year. The corresponding number is 15% among those who did work. In constrast, among white women who did not work during the 1988-92 period, 51% received spousal income in each year and only 26% received government assistance in each year. The corresponding percentages among participants are 41 and 2, respectively. Although receipt of public assistance is more common among nonparticipants in both the black and white samples, the overall patterns suggests that nonparticipation in the white sample is associated with spousal support whereas nonparticipation in the black sample is associated with receiving public assistance.
399~D1~F14~Findings~Receipt of Aid and Nonparticipant Black Respondents~Note that the 78% figure for receipt of aid among black nonparticipants represents almost 8% of the entire black sample. These women did not work outside the home while receiving government aid over a long period. If ones assumes that these women face relatively low potential wages, then it is possible that their missing wage data significantly affect the measured average wage among black women. However, if one imputes wages for long-term welfare recipients, average wages for both black and white women will be affected because over 1 percent of women in the white sample also report receiving aid in each year between 1988 and 1992 while not working in the market.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Wages~"…the author conduct several exercises that involve wage imputations. The vast majority of the imputation involve women who satisfy four criteria. They must have no postsecondary education. They must have reported no market work during the 1988-92 period. They must have received government aid in every year from 1988 to 1992, and they must have received no spousal support over this period. These women are longterm welfare recipients with low levels of education and no support from a spouse. It seems likely that they choose to accept the asset restrictions and income test associated with government aid programs, in part, because they face poor labor market opportunities. Given imputations for these women, the author can compute wage averages based on samples that include at least 95% of white respondents and 97% of black respondents. In the median regression models below, the author also imputes wages for a group of women who are quite different from long-term aid recipients. in the median regression model, the author imputes high wages for women with at least a high school education who did not worker over the entire period 1988-92 but did receive substantial income support from their spouse. The definition of ""substantial is spelled out below."
399~D1, D2, D3~M2~Methodology~Median Regression~"...In the median regression models below, the author also imputes wages for a group of women who are quite different from long-term aid recipients. in the median regression model, the author imputes high wages for women with at least a high school education who did not worker over the entire period 1988-92 but did receive substantial income support from their spouse. The definition of ""substantial is spelled out below."
399~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Wages~Table 7 provides the wage distributions implied by various imputation rules for the wages of long-term aid recipients with no postsecondary schooling and no spousal support.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~The NLSY data provide a few wage observations for women who are comparable with respect to sources of income and education level. 
399~D1~F15~Findings~4 Characteristics and Average Hourly Wage for Blacks Relative to Whites~There are 36 black women who (i) work in one year and only one year between 1988 and 1992, (ii) receive government aid in each year from 1988 to 1992, (iii) receive no support from a spouse and (iv) have no postsecondary schooling. The mean wage among these women is $4.50 per hour. There are 10 white women who satisfy these conditions. They earn an average of $4.71 per hour. The author assumes that the wage offers of observationally similar women who never worked over the 1988-92 period are likely equal to or below these average wages. 
399~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Wages~There are 36 black women who (i) work in one year and only one year between 1988 and 1992, (ii) receive government aid in each year from 1988 to 1992, (iii) receive no support from a spouse and (iv) have no postsecondary schooling. The mean wage among these women is $4.50 per hour. There are 10 white women who satisfy these conditions. They earn an average of $4.71 per hour. The author assumes that the wage offers of observationally similar women who never worked over the 1988-92 period are likely equal to or below these average wages. The author conducts simulations using these wage averages as imputed values for the wages of observationally similar women who never work during the 1988-92 period, and the author also conducts simulations with imputed wages equal to 90%, 75%, and 50% of these averages.
399~D1, D2, D3~F16~Findings~Baseline Imputations, Wage Levels, and Black-White Wage Inequality~The baseline imputations have trivial effects on wage levels for white women. However, with panel B of table 5 as a starting point, the baseline imputations generate a 20% drop in the average wage of black women, and the black-white wage ratio falls from .82 to .80. The wage ratio is rather insensitive to the specific choice of imputation rule. Among the four different rules illustrated in table 7, the implied black-white wage ratio ranges from .80 to .79. However, the estimated black-white log wage gap is more sensitive to the imputation rule. The estimated gap based on observed wages during the 1988-92 period is -.18. The estimated gaps under the various imputation rules range from -.2 to -.24. for comparison, recall the results in table 4. On the basis of 1990 wage data available in the census, CPS, and NLSY, black-white log wage gaps among women aged 25-33 are -.10, -.15, and -.17, respectively. Thus, if one takes the measured gap in CPS data as a starting point, the combination of higher yearly coverage rates in the NLSY, additional wage information from adjacent years, and the imputaitons based on income sources creates implied black-white gaps in potential log wages that are at least one-third and maybe as much as 60% higher. Even if one takes the -.17 figure from the 1990 NLSY cross section as a baseline, the calculations involving various imputation simply increases of roughly 20-40%.
399~D1, D2, D3~F17~Findings~Sample Trends~Even though table 7 employs observed or imputed wages for all but 3% of the black sample and less than 5% of white women, the remaining samples of black and white women are quite different. Almost 60% of the remaining black women report receiving aid in at least two years; the comparable figure among white women is less than 20%. Further, many of the white women who do not work over the 1988-92 period are quite wealth in terms of family income. Of the 119 white women who are not included in table 7, 30 are married to men who make more than $45,000 per year. Among white males aged 25-35 in the1990 census, $45,000 is at roughly the ninetieth percentile in the distribution of personal income. The decision not to work outside the home among women who are married to men earning such high incomes may signal high wealth and not low wages. In contrast, there is only one woman in the black sample who did not work outside the home over the 1988-92 period but did report spousal income above $30,000 per year. This earnings level denotes the ninetieth percentile in the income distribution for black men aged 25-35.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~An alternative approach involving imputations is to assess black-white inequality using median black-white wage gaps. Median regression is an attractive alternative in contexts in which one can be confident that missing wage data fall completely on one side of the median regreson function. In this context, one can assign arbitrarily low or high values for the missing wages, and the results fromt eh median regression will be the same regardless of the specific value of the imputed wages.

399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~Panel A of table 8 describes results for women who report working during the previous year in their 1990 interview. The first three sets of results correspond to data from the census, CPS, and the 1990 NLSY, respectively. 
399~D1, D3~F18~Findings~Black-White Log Wage Gap in the NLSY and the CPS~ In the NLSY, the median black-white log wage gap with age held constant is -.18. The estimated gaps in the census and CPS are -.11 and -.16, respectively. These estimated gaps are quite similar to the mean gaps reported in table 4.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~The final set of results in Panel A of Table 8 includes all women who worked at least once during the 1988-92 period. Here, the author uses only one wage observation per person. The author does not average wages over the 1988-92 period. For persons with no reported wage in 1990, the author uses the wage reported in the interview that occurred closest to January 1990.
399~D1~F19~Findings~Valid Wage Reporting and Log Wage Inequality~In the sample of women who report a valid wage at some point over the 1988-92 period, the gap widens to -.21, almost twice the size of the gap based on census wages.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~Panel of table 8 presents results that involve imputed wages based on three different imputation rules. Rule 1 designates an hourly wage of $1.00 for the group of long-term aid recipients described in table 7. Rule 2 follows rule 1 and in addition assigns a wage of $30 per hour to all women who (i) did not work in the market over the 1988-92 period, (ii) have at least a high school educaiton, and (iii) report average spousal earnings over the 1988-92 period that place their husbands above the ninetieth percentile in the personal income distribution for men aged 25-35 of the same race. Rule 3 is similar to rule 2 but uses the seventy-fifth percentile in the male income distribution as a cutoff.
399~DV5~L4~Variable Value~Rule 1 Wage~Rule 1 designates an hourly wage of $1.00 for the group of long-term aid recipients described in table 7.
399~DV5~L5~Variable Value~Rule 2 Wage~Rule 2 follows rule 1 and in addition assigns a wage of $30 per hour to all women who (i) did not work in the market over the 1988-92 period, (ii) have at least a high school education, and (iii) report average spousal earnings over the 1988-92 period that place their husbands above the ninetieth percentile in the personal income distribution for men aged 25-35 of the same race. 
399~DV5~L6~Variable Value~Rule 3 Wage~Rule 3 is similar to rule 2 but uses the seventy-fifth percentile in the male income distribution as a cutoff.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~Wage rates are low among black women who report a valid wage in at least on of the 1988-92 surveys but also report no postsecondary schooling, receive aid in all years, and receive no income from a spouse. Roughly 95% of these women make less than the median wage among employed black women in 1990.
399~D1, D2, D3~F20~Findings~Sensitivity of Results to Imputation Rules~The results are not highly sensitive to the various imputation rules, and the estimated median gaps in panel B of table 8 include observed or imputed wages for almost 97% of black women and over 95% of white women. If one treats the wage offers associated with the women in the remaining portions of the black and white samples as random draws from their perspective wage offer distributions, imputation exercises described in panel B imply that the overall median black-white gap in log wages is roughly -.25. In absolute value, this figure represent almost a 40% increase over the -.18 figure derived from the sampling of working women in the 1990 NLSY and it is over 50% larger than the median gap among working women in the CPS.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~In Appendix table B1, researchers explore the role of imputations in the CPS and census data as well. Here, the author assigns a wage of $1.00 per hour to men aged 25-33 who report no market work over an entire year. The estimated median gaps based only on working men follow the same pattern observed among women.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Wages~In Appendix table B1, researchers explore the role of imputations in the CPS and census data as well. Here, the author assigns a wage of $1.00 per hour to men aged 25-33 who report no market work over an entire year. The estimated median gaps based only on working men follow the same pattern observed among women.
399~D2~F21~Findings~Log Wage Gap in Census Data~In Appendix table B1, the estimated gap in census data is -.22, which is smaller than the corresponding gaps of -.30 in CPS data and -.33 in NLSY data. However, given the $1.00 per hour imputations for those who do not work, the results are more similar among the three data sets. The estimated median gaps, given these imputations, range from .337 to .372 in absolute value. given a common method of correcting for selection bias, the estimated median black-white log wage gaps among men in these three data sets falls in a much narrower range, and the implied gaps in the CPS and the NLSY are almost identical.
399~DV5~L6~Variable Value~Rule 3 Wage~There are 41 black women and 68 white women who are not included in the calculations for rule 3. The author computed bounds on the median gap reported under rule 3 by using two different additional imputation rules. First, the author estimated a median regression on the full sample by imputing wages of $1.00 per hour to these 41 black women and wages of $30 per hour to the 68 white women. Then the author reveresed the imputations and estimated the model again.

Then the author reveresed the imputations and estimated the model again.
399~D1, D2, D3~F22~Findings~Imputation Rules and Log Wage Gaps~…when using the two different additional imputation rules for rule 3, conditional on indicator variables for age, the estimated black-white median log wage gaps are -.319 and -.216.
399~D1, D2, D3~V7~Variable~Age~…included in median and log wage regression analysis.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV3~Derived Variable~Distribution of Wages~Consider a world with two populations of N women each. Every woman in population A (white) has a counterpart in population B (black) who possesses the exact same skill endowment. Therefore, if researchers assume no discrimination for the moment, the distribution of market wage offers for women in group A is identical to the distribution in group B. Futher, women in both groups live in the same political jurisdiction and therefore face the same taxes and have access to the same transfer programs. 
399~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Race~…a race indicator used to differentiate between white and black respondents.
399~D1, D2, D3~V9~Variable~Marital Decisions~Assume that, regardless of race, each woman receives one offer of marriage from a potential mate. Even though black and white women enjoy the same opportunities outside marriage, assume that the marriage market for white women strictly dominates the marriage market for black women. In particular, assume that each white woman receives an offer of marriage from a man whose market wage exceeds the market wage of any man who is proposing to any black woman who shares the white woman's same skill endowment. Now, consider a pair of women, one black and one white, who possess the same skill endowments. if both chooose not to marry, they will make the same labor supply decisions because they have the same endowments and face the same constraints. Thus, among any black-white pair that make different labor supply decisions, researchers know that at least on of the women is married, and further, researchers know that either both women are married or only the white woman is married, since the white women in each pair receives a marriage proposal from a man with higher market earning potential. Thus, if a white woman does not work outside the home and her black counterpart does, the white woman must be married; if the pattern s reversed and a black woman works at home whereas her white counterpart works in the market, it is clear not only that the white woman must be married but also that the black woman must be single. If both woman are married and possess the same skill endowment and the black woman does not work, then the white woman, who shares a common potential wage and has a husband who commands a higher market wage, will not work either.
399~D1, D2, D3~V10~Variable~Labor Supply Decisions~Assume that, regardless of race, each woman receives one offer of marriage from a potential mate. Even though black and white women enjoy the same opportunities outside marriage, assume that the marriage market for white women strictly dominates the marriage market for black women. In particular, assume that each white woman receives an offer of marriage from a man whose market wage exceeds the market wage of any man who is proposing to any black woman who shares the white woman's same skill endowment. Now, consider a pair of women, one black and one white, who possess the same skill endowments. if both chooose not to marry, they will make the same labor supply decisions because they have the same endowments and face the same constraints. Thus, among any black-white pair that make different labor supply decisions, researchers know that at least on of the women is married, and further, researchers know that either both women are married or only the white woman is married, since the white women in each pair receives a marriage proposal from a man with higher market earning potential. Thus, if a white woman does not work outside the home and her black counterpart does, the white woman must be married; if the pattern s reversed and a black woman works at home whereas her white counterpart works in the market, it is clear not only that the white woman must be married but also that the black woman must be single. If both woman are married and possess the same skill endowment and the black woman does not work, then the white woman, who shares a common potential wage and has a husband who commands a higher market wage, will not work either.
399~D1, D2, D3~F23~Findings~Appendix C~Appendix C demonstrates that under common assumptions about household formation and time allocation within households, this group of single black women who work at home will, on average, enjoy lower wage offers than the aforementioned group of married white women who work at home. This results requires that preferences and technologies generate assortative mating in marriage markets and that the allocation of time to tasks among husbands and wives reflect patterns of comparative advantage. Given this result, similar labor force participation rates among black and white women are not a sign that selection bias is not a problem but rather a guarantee that black-white wage gaps among working women will not accurately reflect black-white gaps in potential wages. Recall that the distribution of black and white potential wages is the same in this example. Thus, if the same fraction of black and white women choose to work at home, but white women who remain at home enjoy better potential market wages than their black counterparts, measured black-white wage gaps will indicate a labor market advantage for black women even though none exists. This result holds given numerous possible patterns of marriage and labor supply decisions. Married white women who do not work may enjory higher or lower potential wages than married white women who do, and the same is true among married black women. Further, for both black and white women, there is no restriction that the average observed wage be gerater or less than the average potential wage.
399~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Race~…racial differences in selection greatly complicate attempts to measure the effects of racial discrimination among women.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~At all skill and educaiton levels, black men work less than white men. If one assumes that these differences and the resulting differences in wage growth are entirely due to employment discrimination, one can isolate the effects of market discrimination on wages at a given age by conditioning on a measure of skills that predates market entry.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV1~Derived Variable~Black-White Wage Inequality~Among the well-educated and highly skilled, black women work more than white women. Further, it seems far-fetched to assume that this differential reflects discrimination in favor of black women. It seems more likely that these differences reflect the fact that educated white women are wealthier than their black counterparts because they enjoy better marriage market prospects. In such a setting, one might observe black women earning higher wages than white women who share the same age, education level, and AFQT scores, and this differential would not be evidence of preferential treatment for black women, but rather the result of more accumulated work experience per year of potential experience. Note that this problem persists even if a given data set provides complete information on the potential wages of all women at a given point in time.
399~D2~D2~Dataset~Census~Census and CPS data from 1980 indicate that college-educated black women earn more than their white counterparts.

399~D1, D3~F24~Findings~Black-White Wage Gap Among Working Women~The black-white wage gap among working women actually increased slightly over the 1990-99 period. Some might conclude on the basis of these data that, during the 1990s, the labor market prospects of black women relative to white women held constant or declined slightly. However, there are also noteworthy differences between the 1990 and 1999 data on participation. In the March 1990 CPS, 71% of white women with no postsecondary schooling worked at some point during the past calendar year. The comparable figure among black women with no postsecondary schooling was only 64%. However, in 1999, the pattern is reversed. Black women with no college schooling now work more than their white counterparts by a margin of 71-67%. Further, the fraction of college-educated white women who work fell slightly over the 1990s; the opposite is true among college-educated black women.
399~D1~F25~Findings~Black-White Gaps Across Genders in the NLSY~The estimates of median black-white gaps in log potential wages among men and women in the NLSY imply that the black-white wage gap among women is more than two-thirds as large as the black-white wage gap among men.
399~D1~DV11~Derived Variable~Schooling Gap~The NLSY data show that the black-white gap in years of school completed is only slightly larger among men than among women.
399~D1~DV12~Derived Variable~AFQT Score Gap~…the AFQT score gap among women is over one standard deviation and is quite close in magnitude to the gap observed among men.
399~D1~V11~Variable~AFQT Score~…basic skill levels are measured by scores on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT).
399~D1, D2, D3~V8~Variable~Race~The author constructs race variables for NLSY data that parallel the race definitions in census data. The black indicator is straightforward. However, the white indicator requires information from two variables. The NLSY respondents, as part of questions about all family members in the respondent's household, provide information about race and ethnicity. The white sample used in this paper includes persons who report being white but do not report being of Asian ancestry.
399~D1~D1~Dataset~National Longitudinal Survey of Youth~The author constructs race variables for NLSY data that parallel the race definitions in census data. The black indicator is straightforward. However, the white indicator requires information from two variables. The NLSY respondents, as part of questions about all family members in the respondent's household, provide information about race and ethnicity. The white sample used in this paper includes persons who report being white but do not report being of Asian ancestry.

399~D3~F26~Findings~Wage Ratios in the Current Population Survey~…in 1980, black-white wage gaps among working women were small. The 1980 March CPS data imply a black-white wage ratio over .92 among working women aged 25-55, and among all working women in this age range who have any postsecondary schooling, the black-white wage ratio is over .99.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Wages~"The hourly wage variables for the NLSY come from the created variables ""hourly rate of pay at current or most recent job."" These variables are created from answers to questions concerning earnings, time units for pay, and labor supply. In both the census and CPS, the author creates an hourly wage variable. The author divides total wage inome for 1989 by an estimate of total hours worked on the basis of answers to questions about weeks worked and usual hours worked per week. In all three data sets, the author eliminated individuals who report information that implies hourly wage rates below $1.00 per hour or above $100 per hour. In the NLSY data, the author uses the consumer price index urban series to transform all wage observations to 1990 dollars."

399~D1, D2, D3~V9~Variable~Marital Decisions~Each woman receives a marriage proposal from one and only one man in her group, and potential mates are assortatively matched within each group. However, marriage market prospects for women in group A strictly dominate those for women in group B.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV15~Derived Variable~Utility of Marriage~Women calculate the indirect utility of marriage by solving for the allocations of leisure and consumption that they would enjoy in marriage to their potential spouse. They compare this indirect utility with the maximum utility available either through participation in a government assistance program or through living alone with no external source of support. Women maximize utility by choosing the best available combination of family structure and time allocation. To focus on the role of wages, assume that no woman or man in either market possesses nonearned income. All income other than labor market income comes through government programs. These programs may condition aid on realized earnings, but the government is not able to condition taxes or transfers aid on skill endowments or potential market wages. Further, assume that all persons of a given gender are equally productive in home productiong regardless of group membership.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Total Surplus in Marriage~…the author suppress group subscripts and the author uses TS(i) to denote the total realized surplus in marriage between the ith woman and the ith man in marriage market.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV15~Derived Variable~Utility of Marriage~The author assumes that utility for both parties can be expressed in units of some numeraire good.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Total Surplus in Marriage~Total surplus (TS) is the difference between two sums: the sum of each partner's utility level within marriage and the sum of the utility levels associated with each partner's outside option. Condition A1 guarantees that the surplus in marriage exhibits increasing returns to scale with respect to the skill endowments of the partners. This is a standard property of household models that involve collective consumption and efficient bargaining with marriage.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV16~Derived Variable~Total Surplus in Marriage~Bargaining within marriage is regular; that is, if a change in endowments or technology causes the total surplus in a marriage to rise (fall), then the individual utilities of both partners will rise (fall).
399~D1~V13~Variable~Time Units for Pay~If the ith woman in a given market is married, with her potential wage w(i) held constant, the amount of time she spends in market work is a nonincreasing function of her husband's potential wage e(i).

399~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Average Predicted Log Wages~Among single women in a given marriage market, women who participate in market work have higher potential wages than single women who do not participate in the market.
399~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Average Predicted Log Wages~Assuming that there are group differences in the patterns of selection into work among women, the average potential wage among women in group A who do not work will exceed the corresponding average in group B.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Wages~Given the remaining three sources of differential selection described in pairs 1-3, the wage offer for a pair of women described by pair 1 must be less than the wage offer for women who satisfy pair 2 since the group B women described in these pairs are both single, and only the one in pair 2 participates in market work. Further, the woman in pair 3 must enjoy a greater potential wage than the women in pair 2 since the group B woman in pair 3 is maried and the group B woman in pair 2 is not. Note that conditions A1 and A2 together imply that all single persons have lower market wage offers than all married persons.
399~D1, D2, D3~DV6~Derived Variable~Average Predicted Log Wages~…the group B women described in pair 1 have lower potential wages than the group A women in pairs 2 and 3.

402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~This study examines how health responds to transitory changes in economic conditions. Fixed-effect (FE) models are estimated using longitudinal data for the 1972-1991 period, with health proxied by total and age-specific mortality rates and ten particular causes of death.
402~D2~T1~Time Period~1972-1991~Fixed-effect (FE) models are estimated using longitudinal data for the 1972-1991 period.
402~D2~V1~Variable~Mortality Rates~…health is proxied for by total and age-specific mortality rates and ten particular causes of death.
402~D2~V2~Variable~Cause of Death~…health is proxied for by total and age-specific mortality rates and ten particular causes of death.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~State~…the unit of observation is the state.
402~D3, D4~V4~Variable~Unemployment~…most of the analysis focuses on within-state variations in unemployment and personal incomes.
402~V6~V5~Variable~Personal Income~…most of the analysis focuses on within-state variations in unemployment and personal incomes.
402~D4~V6~Variable~National Unemployment Rates~…limited attention is also paid to the changes in national unemployment rates.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~…microdata for 1987-1995 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) are used to examine how risky behaviors and time-intensive health investments in physical activity, diet, and preventive medical care vary with the status of the economy.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~State Fixed-Effects~…state fixed-effects are controlled for in the analysis.
402~D3, D5, D6~DV1~Derived Variable~Demographic Characteristics~…a variety of demographic characteristics are controlled for in the analysis.

402~D1~V9~Variable~Risky Behaviors~…microdata for 1987-1995 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) are used to examine how risky behaviors and time-intensive health investments in physical activity, diet, and preventive medical care vary with the status of the economy.

402~D1, D3, D4, D5, D6~F1~Findings~Health and the Economy~…the analysis provides strong evidence that health improves when the economy temporarily deteriorates. Specifically, state unemployment rates are negatively and significantly related to total mortality and eight of the ten specific causes of fatalities, with suicides representing an important exception. The variation in death rates is strongest for those causes and age groups were fluctuations are most plausible, and there is some evidence that the unfavorable health effects of temporary upturns are partially or fully offset if the economic growth is long-lasting. Consistent with these results, the microdata reveal that higher joblessness is associated with reduced smoking and obesity, increased physical activity, and improvided diet.
402~D3, D4, D5, D6~DV2~Derived Variable~Economic Conditions~"…discussions of ""cyclical"" variations or ""macroeconomic"" effects refer mainly to changes occurring within states rather than at the national level. For instance, the term ""recession"" is used loosely to indicate the effects of increases (decreases) in state unemployment rates (personal incomes), instead of a technical definition based on changes in national GDP."
402~D3, D5, D6~DV3~Derived Variable~Utility~"…assume that individual maximize a utility function with health and other consumption as arguments subject to budget and time constraints, where health is produced by nonmarket ""leisure"" time, medical care, baseline status, and health shocks. Utility maximization then implies allocating time and purchased goods to equalize the marginal utility of the last dollar's worth of medical care, other consumption, and leisure."
402~D2~V1~Variable~Mortality Rates~…in the current model, permanently higher incomes will probably be associated with health improvements since the budget constrain is shifted out. However, there are at least four reasons why health might decline during temporary upturns. First, the opportunity cost of time is likely to rise. Second, health could be an input into the production of goods and services. Third, some risky activities may be normal goods. Fourth, in-migration in response to improvements in local economic conditions could have negative effects.

Second, health could be an input into the production of goods and services. Third, some risky activities may be normal goods. Fourth, in-migration in response to improvements in local economic conditions could have negative effects.
402~D2~V1~Variable~Mortality Rates~"Even if a permanent rise in income improves health, temporary growth could cause mortality to increase. There are two basic reasons why the long- and short-run effects may differ. First, agents have greater flexibility in making consumption, time allocation, and production decisions to improve health in the long run. Second, even relatively small negative health shocks, associated with transitory upturns, may cause frail individuals to die slightly sooner than they otherwise would, while having little effect on life expectancy or overall population health. This phenomenon is referred to as ""harvesting"" by epidemiologists. The negative effects of economic growth will again probably be more pronounced in the short run than in the long run, since temporary increases in production usually combine greater use of labor and health inputs with existing technologies, whereas permanent growth results from new technologies that have the potential to ameliorate or eliminate any costs to health. Permanently higher incomes, however, may permit, greater investments in road and vehicle safety, possibly ameliorating or reversing this effect in the long run."

402~D3, D5, D6~DV4~Derived Variable~Opportunity Cost of Time~Leisure time declines during economic upturns, making it more costly to undertake health-producing activities (such as exercise) that are time-intensive. Similarly, the time price of medical care will rise if individuals working more hours find it harder to schedule medical appointments for themselves or thier dependents. Medical care utilization is harder to predict because the higher time costs may be offset by increased availability of health insurance or because health deteriorates when the economy improves.
402~D1~V10~Variable~Health Investments~…intertemporal substitution implies that individuals will be more likely to defer time-intensive health investments in response to a temporary than a permanent increase in wages.
402~D2~V1~Variable~Mortality Rates~Health may be an input into the production of goods and services. Most directly, hazardous working conditions, job-related stress, and the physical exertion of employment may have negative effects on health, particularly when job hours are extended during short-lasting economic expansions. these effects will be reinforced since cyclically sensitive sectors, particularly construction, have high accident rates.

402~V2~L6~Variable Value~Other Accidents and Adverse Effects~…work-related accidents are likely to become more common during temporary expansions.
402~V2~L5~Variable Value~Motor Vehicle Accidents~…a particularly important cause of death for the current research as drinking and driving rises in the good times, leading to higher motor vehicle fataility rates.
402~D5~V11~Variable~Migration Flows~Importantly, migration flows are large in the United States in response to changes in local economic conditions. This mobility has the potential to raise death rates in destination states through increasing crowding, because the new migrants import disease, or if they are unfamiliar with roads or the medical infrastructure. Conversely, since movers tend to be relatively young and (presumably) health, migration may induce a spurious negative correlation between economic conditions and mortality rates.

402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~"Cook and Tauchen [1984] show that, for this model, heteroskedasticity takes the form, ln (1 + (1-p)/pN), for p the probability of death and N the cell size. Thus, weighting by (the square root of) population size is not correct. However, with small p, the variance of the error term is approximately proportional to the cell size, and the procedure is close to being right. In this case, 1 - p ~= 1 and, for large N, ln (1 + (1-p)/pN) ~= 1/pN. The author also experimented with a three-stage weighting procedure for the total mortality models. OLS was used in the first stage. The squared residuals were then regressed against a constant and the reciprocal of the state population. The constant term never differed significantly while the population variable was always highly significant, as expected if the heteroskedasticity results from sampling error. The square roots of the inverse of the predicted values from the second-stage regression were then used as weights in a final set of estimates. The resulting coefficients on unemployment rates and personal incomes were virtually identical to those obtained using the more conventional weighting procedure."

EP ratios are considered because some economists argue that they provide a more accurate measure of labor market conditions for groups frequently entering and exiting the labor force. Changes in payroll employment may reflect migration flows in response to local economic conditions. Personal incomes, in 1987 dollars adjusted by the implicit price deflator, are sometimes controlled for.

402~D5~D5~Dataset~Census~…the regressions hold constant the percentage of the state population with three levels of educational attainment, in two ethnic groups, and two age categories. Ethnic status and age are measured over the full population; educational attainment refers to persons aged 25 and higher. These variables are constructed using census data for the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. Values for the noncensus years are interpolated by assuming a constant rate of grwoth between census periods.

402~D2~F2~Findings~Total Mortality and Cause of Death Trends During the Sample Period~…total mortality and most specific sources of fatalities declined substantially during the sample period. The overall death rate fell more than 8% over the twenty years (decreasing from 943.2 to 860.3 per 100,000 persons), with substantially larger 27% and 36% reductions in mortality due to heart disease and vehicle crashes. By contrast, cancer fatalities increased 23%, and deaths from influenza/pneumonia, suicides, and homicides also rose (by 3%, 2%, and 12%). Mortality from all of the other specific causes trended downward, as did the death rates of all three age groups.
402~D5~D5~Dataset~Census~"…the Census' reporting of eduction changed between 1980 and 1990. In 1970 and 1980 information on years of college was provided; the 1990 data indicated whether a college degree had been obtained. The ""some college"" group refers to persons with one to three years of university education in 1970 and 1980 and some college but no bachelor's degree in 1990. The ""college graduate"" group is those with four or more years of college in the two earlier census years and with a bachelor's degree in the latest one. Many students take more than four years to obtain a degree, so the percentage of college graduates is likely to be moderately overstated prior to 1990."

402~D5~D5~Dataset~Census~…variables indicating age, education, and population size are constructed using census data reported in the Statistical Abstract of the United States and, for the percentage of Hispanics in 1970, from United States Burea of the Census [1973].

402~D4~V6~Variable~National Unemployment Rates~…this variabe is detrended, using a linear trend, and normalized by subtracting the mean of the detrended variable and dividing by its standard deviation.
402~D2, D4~F3~Findings~Total Mortality and National Unemployment Rates~…figures reporting the total mortality rate and national unemployment rates preview the econometric results to follow: a strong inverse relationship between economic conditions and fatality rates. Deaths declined dramatically druing the 1975 and 1982 to 1983 recessions, while increasing throughout much of the recovery of the middle 1980s. although the national data may suffer from the aformentioned problems of confounding, these findings raise questions about the common belief that health declines during economic contractions.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~State Fixed-Effects~…the fixed-effect estimates exploit within-state variations in economic conditions and have the potential to improve on (aggregate) time-series analyses if there are substantial independent macroeconomic fluctuations across states over time. This condition appears to be met.
402~D1, D2, D3, D4~F4~Findings~Squared-Correlation Coefficients Between Fixed Effects and the National Unemployment Rates~…the squared-correlation coefficients between fixed effects and the national unemployment rates are fairly low - the R-squared exceeds .9 in just three states, is above .75 in only fourteen, and is less than .5 in twenty states. Similarly, state unemployment rankings vary substantially over time. Thus, none of the five states with the highest unemployment in 1976 (the first year the data were universally available) were in the top five in 1991, and just three states ranked in the top ten during both years.
402~D2, D3, D4~F5~Findings~Time Trends Among Unemployment and Total Mortality~…unemployment exhibits virtually no time trend, decreasing by .003 percent per year. Conversely, total mortality declines by 3.1 deaths per 100,000 persons annually. A regression of the natural log of total mortality on unemployment rates and a linear time trend, using national data (n = 20), yields an unemployment coefficient of -.0102 with a standard error of .0023. 
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…when examining the relationship between economic conditions and total mortality rates, unless otherwise stated, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the death rate (per 100,000 persons).
402~D2~V1~Variable~Mortality Rates~…when examining the relationship between economic conditions and total mortality rates, unless otherwise stated, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the death rate (per 100,000 persons).
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Table II summarizes the results of a vairiety of specifications, all of which control for state population characteristics (age, education, and ethnic status), state fixed-effects, and use state or national unemployment rates to proxy macroeconomic conditions. Most specifications also include year dummy variables, and some hold constant personal incomes, state-specific (linear) time trends, or both.
402~D2, D3~F6~Findings~Joblessness and Total Mortality~Joblessness is always negatively and statistically significantly correlated with total mortality. For the full sample (shown in the top panel), a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate decreases the predicted death rate by approximately 0.5%. This estimate is insensitive to the inclusion of state-specific time trends. When measured in levels, rather than logs, the one point increase in joblessness is expected to reduce fatalities by 4.6 per 100,000; this is also equivalent to a 0.5% decline from its base of 879.8 per 100,000 (see the last two columns of the table).
402~V3, V6~F7~Findings~Personal Income and Mortality~Personal income is positively related to mortality - a $1000 increase is associated with a 0.4% to 0.6% rise in fatalities - but controlling for it only modestly decreases the unemployment coefficient and the estimated income effect is reveresed when the dependent variable is measured in levels instead of natural logs.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F8~Findings~Demographic Coefficients and Mortality~The demographic coefficients conform to the expectations. Mortality increases with age, graduation from college is predicted to modestly reduce deaths, and blacks have higher fatality rates than whites. The unemployment coefficient is roughly one-third larger in models without controls for population characteristics, with the entire difference caused by the exclusion of age.
402~D2, D3, D4~F9~Findings~Fatalities, EP Ratios, Payroll, and Unemployment Rates~Fatalities always exhibit a substantial procyclical variation in specifications controlling for EP ratios or nonagricultural payroll employment, rather than unemployment rates, or the natural log rather than the level of personal inomes. For instance, a one percentage point increase in the EP ratio raises the predicted death rate 0.3% to 0.5%, with the smaller magnitude of the effect consistent with the larger cyclical fluctuation of EP ratios than unemployment rates. Similarly, in models with state time trends, a 1% increase in payroll employment reduces expected mortality by approximately 0.2%.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~The sample in the top panel includes annual observations for the 50 states and the District of Columbia covering the period 1972-1991. Missing data on unemployment rates for some sttaes prior to 1976 reduce the sample size to 930. Sample sizes are 471 and 459 for the 1972-1982 and 1983-1991 time periods and 200, 180, and 180 for the largest, fastest growing, and slowest growing states. The bottom panel of Table II presents separate estimates for the 1972-1982 and 1983-1991 periods, the ten largest states (based on 1991 population), and the ten states with the fastes and slowest rates of population growth duringh the 1980s. Splitting the sample into shorter time periods is likely to reduce the influence of within-state changes in omitted factors that are correlated with unemployment rates, since the size of the trend component is decreased relative to any fluctuations around the trend. The rationale for limiting the sample to large states is that measurement-error problems may bne less severe for them. If the negative health effects of economic expansions result from migration, a stronger negative correlation between unemployment and mortality would be expected in fact than in slow growing states.
402~V3~L34~Variable Value~10 Largest States~The ten largest states refer to rankings in 1991 and include, in descending order of size, California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, and North Carolina.
402~V3~L35~Variable Value~Fast Growing States~Fast growing states refer to those with the largest growth rates between 1980 and 1990. These include Nevada, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, California, New Hampshire, Texas, Georgia, Utah, and Washington.
402~V3~L36~Variable Value~Slow Growing States~Slow growing states refer to those with the smalles growth rates between 1980 and 1990. These include West Virginia, Indiana, North Dakota, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, and Kentucky.
402~D2, D3, D4~F10~Findings~Unemployment, Death Rates, and Year Dummy Variables~An even stronger negative relationship between unemployment and death rates is observed when year dummy variables are excluded. A one percentage point rise is associated with a 0.6% to 0.7% decline in mortality and the parameter estimate is virtually identical when either the state or the national unemployment rate is controlled for. However, when both the state and national rate are included in the same model, there is no independent impact of the latter, suggesting that national business cycles affect health entirely through the resulting changes in state economic conditions.
402~D2~F11~Findings~Procyclical Variation of Mortality~Mortality exhibits a procyclical variation for all of the subsamples. Restricting the analysis to large states has virtually no effect on the unemployment coefficient. The cyclical fluctuation is smaller prior to 1983 than subsequently but, even in the earlier period, a one percentage point increase in unemployment reduces the predicted death rate by a statistically significant 0.5%. The negative relationship between unemployment and mortality is relatively strong in fast growing states - a one point increase in joblessness is predicted to reduce fatalities by around 0.8% - but there is also a strong response in states with stagnant populations, thus providing mixed evidence on the hypotheses that migration flows cause poor health outcomes. The coefficient on personal incomes varies by sample, with a positive parameter estimate for both time periods and the ten largest states but a negative sign for the slow growing states. These ambiguous income effects receive further attention below.
402~D2, D5~T3~Time Period~1990.0~In 1990, 72% of fatalities occurred to persons aged 65 and older, as did over 80% of mortality from heart disease and almost 90% of deaths from influenza or pneumonia [Vital Statistics of the United States 1990]. However, individuals younger than 45 accounted for large shares of fatal vehicle crashes (69%), other deadly accidents (42%), suicides (56%), and homicides (83%), while 45-64 year olds disproportionately died from cancer (27%) and liver disease (42%).
402~D4~F12~Findings~State Unemployment Rates and the Predicted Death Rate~…a one percentage point rise in state unemployment lowers the predicted death rate of 20-44 year olds by 2.0%, has no effect on persons aged 45-64, and reduces the expected fatalities of senior citizens by less than 0.3%. Holding income constant, a one percentage point increase in joblessness is associated with a 0.3% reduction in the death rates of both 45-64 and >=65 year olds, which is only one-fourth the estimated effect for those aged 25-44.
402~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~DV9~Derived Variable~Impact of Economic Conditions~One reason macroeconomic conditions have such different effects across age groups is that state mean personal income is strongly positively correlated with the expected mortality of 20-44 year olds - an extra $1000 increases predicted fatalities by 5.2% - but not for the two older groups.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5~F13~Findings~Predicted Death Rate in 1990 Due to a Rise in Unemployment~…more than 1.5 million senior citizens died in 1990, versus only 145,000 25-44 year olds. However, a one percentage point rise in unemployment would have decreased the predicted number of deaths involving the latter group by more than 2900, compared with a reduction of around 4900 for the former. Thus, young adults accounted for fewer than one-tenth as many deaths as those 65 and over, but the change in fatalities associated with higher joblessness is around three-fifths as large.
402~D2, D3, D4~F14~Findings~State Unemployment Rates and Source of Death~State unemployment rates are also negatively and significantly related to eight of the ten specific causes of death, confirming that many apsects of health deteriorate when the economy improves. Moreover, the fatalities disproportionately experienced by young adults exhibit greater variation than those concentrated among older persons. A one point increase in unemployment reduces predicted mortality from motor vehicle crashes, other accidents, and homicides by 3.0%, 1.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, whereas deaths from cardiovascular disease and influenz/pneumonia are expected to fall just 0.5% and 0.7%. The findings are also consistent with patterns of disease progression. For instance, it would be surprising to observe significant variation in cancer fatalities, since deaths from this source are unlikely to respond much to short term changes in medical care or lifestyles. The lack of any effect for cancer therefore serves as an internal check of the validity of the results.
402~V3, V4, V6, V7~F15~Findings~Personal Incomes, Cause of Death, and Unemployment~Personal incomes have a small and statistically insignificant effect on most causes of death, and their inclusion generally has little impact on the unemployment coefficients. However, income is positively correlated with vehicle fatalities and homicides. Since young adults frequently die from these causes, this helps to explain why incomes are strongly related to the deaths of 20-44 year oldss but with no observed association for persons >= 65 and a negative correlation for 45-64 year olds.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Additional information was obtained by estimating models that controlled for personal incomes but not unemployment (to allow for the possibility that including the latter absorbs a portion of the short-run income effect) and from specifications that included various measures of inequality (i.e., the state poverty rate or the ratio of incomes of the ninetieth versus the tenth, the ninetieth versus fiftieth, or the seventy-fifth versus twenty-fifth percentile of households).
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F16~Findings~Additional Specification Results~…in additional specifications that controlled for personal incomes but not unemployment, the state poverty rate or the ratio of incomes of the ninetieth versus the tenth, the ninetieth versus fiftieth, or the seventy-fifth versus twenty-fifth percentile of households, there was never a consistent relationship between incomes and mortality, with positive correlations obtained for the majority of causes of death. The income coefficients were also never much affected by including the inequality variables, while results for the latter were mixed and usually statistically insignificant.
402~D2, D3, D4~F17~Findings~Suicides and the State Unemployment Rate~Suicides are predicted to rise 1.3% for each one percentage point increase in state unemployment rates. This divergent result is particulary interesting because many of the other outcomes primarily proxy physical health or nondisease sources of death, whereas suicides are among the most widely studied indicators of mental health. It therefore raises the possibility that worsening economic conditions have negative effects on some facets of mental health, while improving physical well-being. Equally important, the finding suggests that previous analysies of suicides provide little indication of the effects of the macroeconomy on other aspects of health.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Column c of table III, shows results for models that include both national and state unemployment rates (but exclude year dummy variables).
402~D2, D3, D4, D5~F18~Findings~Parameter Estimates on the National Unemployment Rate, Age, and Cause of Death~The parameter estimate on the national unemployment rate is small and insignificant for the three age groups and several causes of death. However, positive coefficients are obtained for heart disease, nonmotor vehicle accidents, homicides, and infant/neonatal mortality, while negative effects are predicted for motor vehicle fatalities and deaths due to flue or pneumonia. These mixed findings fail to provide a strong indication that the national economy has an independent impact on health, after controlling for local economic conditions, but further study of this issue is obviously needed.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the author estimated models that included interactions between the national and state unemployment rate. In addition, the author replicated Table III for specifications that included state-specific time trends.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5~F19~Findings~Interacted Unemployment Rate Models and the Interaction Coefficients~…in estimating the interacted unemploment rate equations, the interaction coefficients were positive for some types of deaths but negative for others. In replicating Table III specifications that included state-specific time trends, the results were generally close to those presented, with no clear pattern of differences. The most important changes were that the coefficient on state unemployment shrunk for infant and neonatal mortality; that on the national unemployment rate became significantly negative (positive) for deaths involving 20-44 year olds (due to homicides) and insignificant for heart disease, flu/pneumonia, and infant or neonatal mortality, and the income effect was significantly negative (positive) for heart disease and flu/pneumonia (homicides).
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…to provide information on dynamics of the adjustement process, mortality equations were estimated with the inclusion of four-year lags of state unemployment rates and (in some specifications) personal incomes. Table IV uses the resulting estimates to summarize the predicted impact of a one percentage point rise in unemployment that begins in year t and continues through t + 4. A four-year lag was chosen, somewhat arbitrarily, because the coefficient on the fifth lag in the total mortality equation had a p-value greater than .5.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F20~Findings~Time Profile, Source of Death, Economic Conditions, and Mortality Rates~Although the time profile varies with the source of death, a sustained deterioration in state economic conditions is frequently associated with larger short-run than permanent reductions in mortality. Persistently higher unemployment raises predicted deaths from some causes (e.g., cancer) and age groups 45-64 year olds) by the end of the four years. Expected mortality from other sources (heart disease, homicides, or motor vehicle accidents) remains lower at t+4 than before the rise in joblessness but with the initial effect being substantially offset. For example, a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate reduces predicted fatalities from cardiovascular disease by 0.6% at t+1 but by just 0.3% in year t+4.
402~D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F21~Findings~Lagged Equation Results~…the lagged equations, when used to calculate the effect of a temporary increase in unemployment, generally predict a strong but highly transitory reduction in fatalities. For example, a one percentage point rise at time t, which is reversed by t+1, is expected to reduce total mortality rates by 0.6% at t, with no effect at t+2, and a statistically insignificant 0.1% increase at t+4. The corresponding predicted reductions are 1.7%, 0.7%, and 0.3% for deaths of 20-44 year olds and 2.7%, 0.4%, and -0.7% for motor vehicle fatalities.
402~V3, V4, V6, V7~F22~Findings~Personal Incomes and Attenuation of Estimated Unemployment Effects~The inclusion of controls for personal incomes frequently attenuates the estimated unemployment effect. For instance, a sustained one percentage point rise in joblessness is predicted to decrease total fatalities at t+2 by 0.2% and deaths due to heart disease or vehicle accidents by 0.2%, and 2.0%, when personal incomes are held constant, as compared with 0.6%, 0.5%, and 4.0% when they are not. This suggests that cyclical fluctuations affect health partly through changes in incomes.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~Microdata from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems are used to show that individuals change their lifestyles in ways consistent with the fluctuations in health.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~The BRFSS is an annual survey, administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that collects comparable information across states and time periods for repeated cross sections of individuals. The sample is designed to be representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized adult population. The survey was initiated in 1984 but only fifteen states took part in that year. This analysis uses data for the 1987-1995 period. In 1987, 34 states participated, and over 50,000 individuals were interviewed. by 1995 all 50 states and the District of Columbia were included, and the sample size approached 114,000.
402~D1~T4~Time Period~1987-1995~This analysis uses BRFSS data for the 1987-1995 period.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~The data source has many advantages. Most importantly, it contains information on lifestyle behaviors and preventive medical care for a large sample of respondents and is designed to measure progress toward meeting the Health People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease PRevention Objectives (hereafter abbreviated as Health People 2000).
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~The outcomes examined in the BRFSS include the following: tobacco use and drinking, height-adjusted weight, physical activity, diet, and preventive medical care.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~Sample sizes increase monotonically over time but are smaller for some outcomes, primarily because many questions are contained in optional modules included by some but not all states.
402~D1~V18~Variable~Current Smoker (%)~Smoking is the most important preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Since tobacco is a normal good, smoking is likely to be procyclical, which may explain a portion of the observed variation in mortality.
402~D1~V19~Variable~Number of Cigarettes Smoked Per day~Smoking is the most important preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Since tobacco is a normal good, smoking is likely to be procyclical, which may explain a portion of the observed variation in mortality.
402~D1~V20~Variable~Current Drinker (%)~"…heavy drinking is a significant risk factor, and alcohol-involved driving currently accounts for around one-third of all traffic fatalities. However, whereas the risks of smoking increase monotonically with use, ""light"" drinking probably has little negative effect on health, and there is even some evidence of benefits."
402~D1~V21~Variable~Number of Drinks in Last Month~"…heavy drinking is a significant risk factor, and alcohol-involved driving currently accounts for around one-third of all traffic fatalities. However, whereas the risks of smoking increase monotonically with use, ""light"" drinking probably has little negative effect on health, and there is even some evidence of benefits."
402~V23~L37~Variable Value~Obesity~Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States and a major risk factor for many sources of morbidity. Thus, death rates might fall as the economy weakens because individuals have more time to exercise or consume healthy diets, reducing the probability of being overweight.
402~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Physical Activity and Diet~Physical activity and diet may also directly affect health, beyond any impact on obesity.
402~D1~V22~Variable~Preventive Medical Care~Health could improve during downturns because individuals have more time to invest in preventive medical care. However, the lower time prices could be offset by reductions in income or health insurance coverage or because improved health decreases the incentives to obtain such care. Also, some types of prevention (e.g., pap smears) may occur during the visits treating acute medical problems, so that sicker persons receive more preventive care. 
402~D1~V18~Variable~Current Smoker (%)~Tobacco use is analyzed using a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent has smoked in the last month and, for current smokers, a continuous measure of average daily use.
402~D1~V19~Variable~Number of Cigarettes Smoked Per Day~Tobacco use is analyzed using a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent has smoked in the last month and, for current smokers, a continuous measure of average daily use.
402~D1~V20~Variable~Current Drinker (%)~…drinking is proxied by a dichotomous indicator of use during the past month and, conditional on use, a variable specifying the number of alcoholic bevarages consumed.
402~D1~V21~Variable~Number of Drinks in Last Month~…drinking is proxied by a dichotomous indicator of use during the past month and, conditional on use, a variable specifying the number of alcoholic bevarages consumed.
402~D1~V23~Variable~BMI~"Height-adjusted weight is measured by the body mass index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, and dichotomous variables classifying females (males) with BMI exceeding 27.3 (27.8) as ""overweight,"" those with BMI greater than 30 as ""obese,"" and persons with BMI below 19 as underweight."
402~V23~L38~Variable Value~Overweight~"…a dichotomous variable classifying females (males) with BMI exceeding 27.3 (27.8) as ""overweight""."
402~V23~L37~Variable Value~Obese~"…a dichotomous variable classifying persons with BMI exceeding 30 as ""obese""."
402~V23~L39~Variable Value~Underweight~…a dichotomous variable classifying persons with BMI below 19 as underweight.
402~D1~V24~Variable~Some Physical Activity~"Respondents engage in some leisure time phycial activity if they affirmatively respondent to the question ""During the past month, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises (other than your regular job duties) such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?"""
402~D1~V25~Variable~Regular Physical Activity~"Individuals are classified as partaking in ""regular"" physical activity if they engaged in any activity or pair of activities for at least twenty minutes three or more times per week. "
402~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Physical Activity and Diet~Exercise is captured by two dichotomous variables. 
402~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Physical Activity and Diet~Diet is proxied by two variables.
402~D1~V26~Variable~Daily Servings of Fruits and Vegetables~…indicates the average daily number of servings of fruits and vegetables as a proxy for diet.
402~D1~V27~Variable~Grams of Fat Consumed Daily~…an index of grams of dietary fat consumed as a proxy for diet.
402~D1~V22~Variable~Preventive Medical Care~…dichotomous variables are constructed for four types of preventive medical care.
402~V22~L40~Variable Value~Routine Medical Checkup~…the first preventive medical care dichotomous variable shows whether the respondent visited the doctor for a routine medical checkup during the past year.
402~V22~L41~Variable Value~Pap Smear~…the second preventive medical care dichotomous variables indicates receipt of a pap smear during the past year.
402~V22~L42~Variable Value~Mammogram~…the third preventive medical care dichotomous variables indicates receipt of a mammogram during the past year.
402~V22~L43~Variable Value~Digital Rectal Exam~…the fourth preventive medical care dichotomous variables indicates receipt of a digital rectal exam (DRE) during the past year.
402~V22~L40~Variable Value~Routine Medical Checkup~Routine medical checkups are included as a general preventive measure for all respondents.
402~V22~L41~Variable Value~Pap Smear~Pap smears are designed to screen for cervical cancer, which kills 4800 women in the United States annually.
402~V22~L42~Variable Value~Mammogram~Mammography is an important method of testing for breast cancer, which causes the deaths of almost 50,000 American females per year.
402~V22~L43~Variable Value~Digital Rectal Exam~DRE is used to screen for prostate cancer, which kills over 40,000 U.S. men, and colorectal cancer, which results in 55,000 fatalities annually.
402~V22~L41~Variable Value~Pap Smear~…the sample includes all adult women in the case of pap smears. A concensus recommendation that all (ever sexually active) women aged eighteen and over should have annual pap smears has been adopted by the American Cancer Society (ACS), National Cancer Institute, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Medical Association (AMA), among others.
402~V22~L42~Variable Value~Mammogram~…the sample includes women aged 40 and over for mammography. The ACS, AMA, and ACOG recommend routine mammograms every one to two years for women after age 40. Routine mammography for women younger than 50 remains controversial.
402~V22~L43~Variable Value~Digital Rectal Exam~…the sample includes men aged 40 and over for DRE. The ACS recommends that men receive an annual DRE for prostate and colorectal cancer starting at 40. The efficacy of DRE for men younger than 50 remains controversial.
402~D1~V23~Variable~BMI~"BMI is a favored method of assessing excess weight because it is simple, rapid, and inexpensive to calculate. The criteria for classifying individuals as ""overweight"" or ""obese"" are widely used. "
402~V23~L38~Variable Value~Overweight~The National Institute of Health recently released guidelines lowering to 25 the BMI threshold for defining persons as overweight; however, preliminary analysis revealed no cyclical variation in the probability of being overweight using this standard. 
402~V23~L39~Variable Value~Underweight~"There is no generally accepted cutoff point for defining individuals as ""underweight,"" but the threshold of 19 is consistent with evidence tha maximum health is achieved when BMI ranges between 20 and 25."
402~D3, D4~V12~Variable~Civilian Unemployment Rate in %~…the unemployment rate averaged for the past 12 months in percent as a state economic condition variable.
402~D3~V28~Variable~Median Income~…the median income for a 4-person families, in thousands of $1987 as a state economic condiiton variable.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~Data are for noninstitutionalized adults from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and cover the period 1987-1995.
402~D4~D4~Dataset~Bureau of Labor Statistics~Information on state unemployment rates is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics database.
402~D3~D3~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Data on family incomes are from the March Current Population Survey.
402~D1, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Linear Probability~Econometric estimates of the determinants of smoking, drinking, and height-adjusted weight are summarized in Table VI. The basic econometric specification is a linear regression where (i) indicates the individual, H the health input, and the other variables are as defined. All of the models include year and state dummy variables and the aforementioned personal characteristics. Robust standard errors are calculated using the Huber-White sandwhich estimator, under the assumption that observations are independent across years and states but not within states in a given year. For ease of interpretation the results of linear probability models are displayed for the dichotomous outcomes. However, corresponding binary probit models were estimated and always yielded virtually identical results.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~Approximately 1% of respondents (7922 individuals) fail to provide information on at least one demographic characteristics. To avoid excluding these persons, the relevant regressors were set to zero and a dummy variable created denoting the presence of a missing value.
402~D5~V7~Variable~Educational Attainment~"For instance, for persons not reporting years of schooling, the three education covariates were given a value of zero and a ""missing education"" variable was set to one."
402~D1, D2, D4~F23~Findings~Procyclical Variation of Tobacco Use~Tobacco use exhibits a strong procyclical variation, possibly explaining some of the health improvement that accompanies economic downturns. A one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate reduces the predicted number of current smokers by 0.3 percentage points. Since roughly one-quarter of the sample smokes, this represents a drop of over 1% (see the upper panel of Table VI). Conditional on smoking, consumption is predicted to fall by around one-tenth of a cigarette per day, a decline of roughly 0.4% at the sample average.
402~D1, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Linear Probability~All specifications include vectors of year and state dummy variables and control for education (high school dropout, some college, college graduates, education not reported), age (years of age, age squared, age not reported), race (black, other nonwhite, race not reported), ethnicity (Hispanic origin, ethnicity not reported), marital status and sex. Robust standard errors, estimated assuming observations are independent across years and states but not within states in a given year, are displayed in parentheses.
402~D1, D2, D4~F24~Findings~Unemployment and Alcohol Use~…the unemployment coefficient is positive for alcohol use. This is a surprising finding since previous research documents a procyclical variation in state alcohol sales and motor vehicle fatalities. Several explanations are possible. First, since the estimate is never statistically significant, this may reflect chance variation. Second, recreational drinking could rise during downturns, whereas problem alcohol use (e.g., binge drinking or drunk-driving) declines. Third, drinking patterns among the BRFSS sample (noninstitutionalized adults contacted by telephone) could differ from those of other adults or youths. Fourth, drinking patterns may have changed over time as information on the possible health benefits of moderate consumption has accumulated. Fifth, the analysis does not control for alcohol tax rates, which varied substantially in some states during the period.
402~D5~DV13~Derived Variable~Age Squared~…the years of age squared.
402~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6~F25~Findings~BMI and Economic Conditions~Individuals are more likely to be in the healthiest weight ranges in bad economic times than in good ones. A one percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with a statistically significant .016 reduction in average BMI, corresponding to a 0.6% decline at the sample average. Since one-quarter of respondents are overweight, versus less than 5% underweight, decreased BMI is likely to indicate better health. The dichotomous outcomes verify this. The one point rise in joblessness lowers the expected probabilities of being underweight, overweight, or obese by a statistically significant .06, .17, and .21 percentage points, corresponding to reductions of 1.3%, 0.7%, and 1.7% at the sample means. It is noteworthy that obesity the extreme indicator of excess weight, is predicted to fall the most and that the likelihood of being underweight also declines, despite a decrease in average BMI. These results suggest that part of the reason health improves when the economy stagnates is that individuals are more likely to be in the desired weight range.
402~D1, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Linear Probability~Linear probability models are estimated when the dependent variables are dichotomous (any or regular physical activity, medical checkups, mammograms, pap smears, and digital rectal exams).
402~D1, D2, D4~F26~Findings~Physical Activity, Diet, and Economic Conditions~Physical activity rises and diet improves when the economy weakens. A one percentage point increase in state unemployment is associated with a statistically significant 0.6 percentage point increase in some exercise and a 0.5 point rise in regular physical activity, corresponding to roughly a 1% elevation in each at the sample means. The same growth in joblessness boosts the predicted consumption of fruits and vegetables by a statistically insignificant .02 servings per day and lowers the daily intake of dietary fat by a statistically significant .71 grams. The latter corresponds to a 2% decrease. 
402~D1, D2, D4~F27~Findings~State Unemployment Rates and Preventive Medical Care~…there exists a negative (although often insignificant) relationship between state unemployment rates and routine checkups, pap smears, mammograms, or digital rectal exams. As mentioned, the procyclical variation is not surprising since preventive care reflects a complicated combination of factors including ex ante health status, incomes, insurance coverage, and the receipt of acute care.
402~D1~D1~Dataset~Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance System~The short time span covered by the BRFSS implies that the findings in the linear probability section should be interpreted somewhat cautiously.
402~D1, D3, D4~M2~Methodology~Linear Probability~The short time span covered by the BRFSS implies that the findings in the linear probability section should be interpreted somewhat cautiously. Of particular importance, after controlling for general time effects, unemployment exhibits a monotonic trend in almost all states during the sample period. As a results, the inclusion of state-specific time trends absorbs most of the remaining within-state variation in joblessness, making it difficult to obtain reliable estimates from models containing both state fixed-effects and time trends.
402~V2~L44~Variable Value~Preventable Deaths~"""Preventable"" deaths, defined to include fatalities from cardiovascular problems, liver disease, or influenza/pneumonia, are so labeled because the progression of these ailments is likely to respond to short-term changes in lifestyles and health investments."
402~V2~L1~Variable Value~Malignant Neoplasms~…cancer mortality is expected to exhibit relatively little behavioral response. 
402~V2~L5~Variable Value~Motor Vehicle Accidents~Deaths due to vehicle crashes or other external sources, the third and fourth components in the table, are likely to be particularly sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations, although the countercyclical pattern of suicides partially offsets the procyclical variation in nonvehicle accidents and homicides.
402~V2~L6~Variable Value~Other Accidents and Adverse Effects~Deaths due to vehicle crashes or other external sources, the third and fourth components in the table, are likely to be particularly sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations, although the countercyclical pattern of suicides partially offsets the procyclical variation in nonvehicle accidents and homicides.
402~V2~L8~Variable Value~Homicide and Legal Intervention~Deaths due to vehicle crashes or other external sources, the third and fourth components in the table, are likely to be particularly sensitive to short-term economic fluctuations, although the countercyclical pattern of suicides partially offsets the procyclical variation in nonvehicle accidents and homicides.
402~D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Mortality Elasticities~Mortality elasticities are estimated by regressing the natural log of the specified death rate on the log of the state unemployment rate, time and state dummy variables, and demographic characteristics. These are shown in the third and fourth columns of Table VIII, with state-specific time trends also held constant in the latter case.
402~D2~F28~Findings~Elasticity of Total Mortality~The elasticity of total mortality is -.04 and precisely estimated. At the sample means, this implies that a one percentage point increase in joblessness decreases predicted fatalities by roughly 0.6%, or around 11,000 deaths annually. The elasticity is marginally lower for preventable deaths, ranging from -.030 to -.035, and for cancer mortality it is close to zero. Conversely, the elasticity is five times as large for motor vehicle fatalities (-.21 to -.22) and 1.5 to 2.3 times as great for other external causes of death (-.06 to -.09)
402~D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Share of Predicted Cyclical Fluctuation~The estimated elasticities are next used to calculate the share of the predicted cyclical fluctuation in total mortality due to each component.
402~D2~F29~Findings~Preventable Sources, Mortality Rates, and Predicted Death Rates~In 1980, preventable sources accounted for over half of all deaths, cancer for one-fifth of fatalities, and car accidents or other external sources for less than 8%. By comparison, preventable sources were responsible for 39% to 48% of the predicted variation in death rates, vehicle fatalities for around 15%, and other external causes for 8% to 12% cancer accounted for no more than 5% of the change in total mortality and 30% was not explained by any of these sources.
402~D2~T5~Time Period~1980.0~The author chose 1980 as the base year in elasticity calculations because it is roughly the midpoint of the sample and preceded the severe 1982-1983 recession.
402~D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Share of Predicted Cyclical Fluctuation~The author chose 1980 as the base year in elasticity calculations because it is roughly the midpoint of the sample and preceded the severe 1982-1983 recession.
402~D2~DV11~Derived Variable~Mortality Elasticities~The author chose 1980 as the base year in elasticity calculations because it is roughly the midpoint of the sample and preceded the severe 1982-1983 recession.
402~D1, D2, D4~F30~Findings~The Relationship Between Macoreconomic Conditions and Health~This study documents a strong inverse relationship between macroeconomic conditions and health. Specifically, a one percentage point rise in the state unemployment rate, relative to its historical average, is associated with a 0.5% to 0.6% decrease in total mortality, or a reduction of around 11,000 fatalities annually.
410~410: College Education and the Midcentury GI Bills~~~~
410~Parent Object~Label~Tag~Value~Context
410~D1, D3, D5~T1~Time Period~1940-1955~Almost 70% of all men who turned 21 between 1940 and 1955 were guaranteed an essentially free college education plus a substantial stipend under one of the two GI bills. This figure is based on self-reported military service during the WWII or Korean War period among males in the 1970 Census.
410~D3~T2~Time Period~1960.0~In 1960 some 18% of the total shock of college-educated males in the United States could claim that their college education had been financed by a GI bill subsidy. This figure uses administrative data on benefits granted during the first five years of each GI bill as a numerator and the number of men reporting one or more years of college education in the 1960 Census as a denominator.
410~D1, D3, D5~T1~Time Period~1940-1955~Veterans entering the military on or before January 31, 1955, were eligible for full benefits, but veterans entering after this date were ineligible for education assistance.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~Veterans entering the military on or before January 31, 1955, were eligible for full benefits, but veterans entering after this date were ineligible for education assistance.
410~D3, D5~V2~Variable~College Attendance~To estimate the effects of the Korean War GI bill, the author compares college attendance after military exit among veterans who entered the military during the year pior to the cutoff date to college attendance among veterans entering the military in the year after it. 
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~In examining the effects of the WWII GI bill, there is no comparison group of veterans available who are ineligible for GI bill benefits. Thus, the author's methods here are of necessity somewhat more speculative than the methods used to estimate the effects of the Korean War GI bill.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~To estimate the likely impact of the WWII GI bill subsidy, the author first compares the postsecondary educational attainment of veterans and similar civilians, after adjusting for a very extensive set of covariates available in the data sources. Because of the selection process for the military in WWII (which picked out the ablest candidates), the author uses this comparison as an upper bound for the effect of the subsidy on higher election.
410~V3~L1~Variable Value~Upper Bound~Because of the selection process for the military in WWII (which picked out the ablest candidates), the author uses the educational attainment comparison as an upper bound for the effect of the subsidy on higher election.
410~V3~L2~Variable Value~Lower Bound~Based on the upper bound calculated from comparing the educational attainment of WWII veterans and similar citizens, the author presents considerable evidence that college attendance decisions among older veterans were much less likely to be affected by the GI bill subsidy than college attendance decisions among younger veterans were. The author takes advantage of this finding to generate a lower bound for the impact of the WWII GI bill among the most affected cohorts of younger veterans.
410~D1, D3~V4~Variable~Veteran Group~The author analyzes the impact of WWII GI bills differentiated by the most affected cohort (younger veterans) and a comparison group  (older veterans).
410~V4~L3~Variable Value~Older Veterans~The author uses a group of veterans born in 1921-1922 (who averaged approximately 21 years old when they entered the military) as a comparison group for younger veterans.
410~V4~L4~Variable Value~Younger Veterans~…younger veterans born in 1923-1926 (who mostly entered the military directly out of high school).
410~V4~L3~Variable Value~Older Veterans~These older veterans were certainly not completely unaffected by the subsidy, but the impact of the GI bill appears to have been markedly lower among them than it was among the slightly younger cohort. However, they are similar to younger veterans in other ways and faced very similar selection procedures for the draft. They are thus an appropriate comparison group to determine a lower bound for the GI bill's effects on veterans.
410~D1, D3, D5~T3~Time Period~1941-1955~The 1941 to 1955 period was marked by two major wars, World War II and the Korean War. Both of these wars resulted in major educational assistance programs aimed at returning veterans.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~…the WWII GI bill was passed in 1944. The education portion of the bill was originally envisaged as a limited program to allow veterans whose education had been interrupted by the war to continue their educaiton. The eventual legislation that passed was much broader, and the response to it was strong. Out of about 15.3 million WWII veterans, some 7.8 million eventually drew on education benefits. However, only a minority of them used their benefits for higher education.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~The Korean War GI bill was passed in July 1952 and was consciously modeled after the WWII GI bill. The generosity of the bill was similar to but somewhat less than that of the WWII GI bill. Again, response was strong; out of around 5.3 million Korean conflict veterans, about 2 million drew on educational benefits under the bill within five years of passage, and more than a million used it for college.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~For the WWII bill, all individuals who had served in the U.S. armed forces during the World War II period (September 1940 through July 1947) were covered for a minimum of one year of training plus one additional months for each month of active duty, up to a maximum of 48 months.
410~D1, D3, D5~T4~Time Period~1940-1947~For the WWII bill, all individuals who had served in the U.S. armed forces during the World War II period (September 1940 through July 1947) were covered for a minimum of one year of training plus one additional months for each month of active duty, up to a maximum of 48 months.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~The Korean War bill also offered benefits to every veteran of the war. The duration of benefits for the Korean War GI bill was defined as one and one-half times any active duty term that included any service during the officially defined Korean War period (June 1950 to January 31, 1955). That is, any veterans who had even one day of service during this period qualified for benefits based on his entire term of military duty, even if most of it was not during the Korean War period. Benefits were limited to 36 months of eligibility (four academic years).
410~D1, D3, D5~T5~Time Period~1950-1955~…the duration of benefits for the Korean War GI bill was defined as one and one-half times any active duty term that included any service during the officially defined Korean War period (June 1950 to January 31, 1955).
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~The vast majority of bveterans in both wars had enough GI bill eligibility to qualify for substantial postsecondary education. According to information from the 1978 Survey of Veterans, over 97% of veterans in both wars qualified for at least three full academic years of financial support and over 80% qualified for the four years of support necessary to earn a bachelor's degree. As a practical matter the author assumes that GI bill eligibility is effectively identical to veterans' status during the relevant war.
410~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Veterans~According to information from the 1978 Survey of Veterans, over 97% of veterans in both wars qualified for at least three full academic years of financial support and over 80% qualified for the four years of support necessary to earn a bachelor's degree. 
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~The financial provisions of the bill were generous. The WWII bill provided full payment for tuition, books, and supplies at essentially any higher education institution in the country, as well as a substantial living stipend that varied based on the familiy size of the veteran. The Korean legislation offered a substantial flat fee (that varied based on family size) from which the veteran was expected to pay both tuition and living expenses.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~Table I summarizes the payment provisions of the two GI bills, and the reductions they created in the total cost (tuition plus opportunity cost) of college attendance for the typical veteran. Both the tuition benefit and the living stipend are included.
410~D2~DV1~Variable~Total Cost~Table I summarizes the payment provisions of the two GI bills, and the reductions they created in the total cost (tuition plus opportunity cost) of college attendance for the typical veteran. Both the tuition benefit and the living stipend are included.
410~D1, D2~F1~Findings~GI Bill Subsidies and Total College Costs~The GI bill subsidies reduced total college costs substantially, with the WWII GI bill being somewhat more generous than the Korean War bill. Cost reductions for veterans receiving the benefit were at least 40% and generally more (especially since two-thirds of Korean veterans attended public universities, and a substantial minority of veterans of both wars had children).
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~In the rest of this paper (minus the calculations used to arrive at finding F2), the author will be using the rough figure of 60% for the cut in total college costs created by the WWII GI bill and 50% for the Korean War GI bill.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~Because essentially all war veterans were eligible for the GI bill, the selection process for military service is also the selection process for GI bill benefits. The Appendix provides a detailed description of military selection procedures during both wars. Mental and physical tests were required for induction, so men who served in the military were a highly select group who differed from civilians in numerous ways. Self-selection through volunteering also occurred during some periods, but the bulk of inductees in both WWII and Korea entered the military through the draft (volunteering was actuall forbidden during much of WWII).

410~D3~DV2~Derived Variable~Opportunity Cost~The opportunity cost is calculated as 75% of the median income of all males between 20 and 24 years old having income in the relevant year.
410~D3~V6~Variable~Family Composition~…the GI bill subsidy per academic year is determined by family composition.
410~D3~V6~Variable~Family Composition~According to the 1950 Census, about 35% of WWII veterans in their twenties had children.
410~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~According to the 1950 Census, about 35% of WWII veterans in their twenties had children.
410~V7~L8~Variable Value~1921-1926~Especially during the WWII period, the great majority of men under age 26 who could pass the mental and physical tests necessary for induction were drafted and served in the military. Over 75% of males born during the 1921 to 1926 period served in WWII. Men in these birth cohorts who did not serve were almost universally classed as deficient in some mental or physical manner that made them unsuited for military service.
410~D1, D3, D5~T4~Time Period~1940-1947~Especially during the WWII period, the great majority of men under age 26 who could pass the mental and physical tests necessary for induction were drafted and served in the military. Over 75% of males born during the 1921 to 1926 period served in WWII. Men in these birth cohorts who did not serve were almost universally classed as deficient in some mental or physical manner that made them unsuited for military service.
410~D1, D3, D5~T5~Time Period~1950-1955~During Korea manpower demands were lower, with only about 60% of young men serving in the military. Deferments or exemptions for young men were somewhat easier to obtain at this time. The Korean War was the first time considerable numbers of men received deferments for college attendance.
410~D4~D4~Dataset~Department of Commerce~College degrees granted to males is drawn from the Department of Commerce [1975].
410~D3~D3~Dataset~Census~…the male population aged 21 is estimated using the 1940 and 1950 Census IPUMS.
410~D3, D4~F2~Findings~Bachelor's Degrees and the Relevant Population~Bachelor's degrees granted to males as a fraction of the relevant population increased 5.1% annually during the years 1936 to 1940.
410~D1, D3, D5~T5~Time Period~1950-1955~To evaluate the effects of the Korean War GI bill, the author uses the sharp cutoff in eligibility for the bill to generate a comparison group. The original 1952 legislation simply stated that veterans qualified for education benefits based on active duty service during an (undefined) Korean War period. Combat on the Korean peninsula ended when a cease-fire was signed in June 1953. However, the official eligibility period for Korean War GI bill education benefits did not end until January 1955. On this date an amendment to the original 1952 legislation was passed stating that all veterans serving in the military at any point from June 1950 to January 1955 were eligible for Korean war gI bill benefits based on their full term of active duty service (even that period after January 1955). Thus, a veteran joining January 1955, would be eligible for Korean War GI bill benefits based on their entire term of service, while a veteran joining February 1, 1955, was not eligible for any benefits at all.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~To evaluate the effects of the Korean War GI bill, the author uses the sharp cutoff in eligibility for the bill to generate a comparison group. The original 1952 legislation simply stated that veterans qualified for education benefits based on active duty service during an (undefined) Korean War period. Combat on the Korean peninsula ended when a cease-fire was signed in June 1953. However, the official eligibility period for Korean War GI bill education benefits did not end until January 1955. On this date an amendment to the original 1952 legislation was passed stating that all veterans serving in the military at any point from June 1950 to January 1955 were eligible for Korean war gI bill benefits based on their full term of active duty service (even that period after January 1955). Thus, a veteran joining January 1955, would be eligible for Korean War GI bill benefits based on their entire term of service, while a veteran joining February 1, 1955, was not eligible for any benefits at all.
410~D1, D3, D5~T6~Time Period~1955-1966~Some ten years after the Korean War GI bill eligibility period ended, the post-Korean War GI bill was passed in June 1966. This bill retroactively made all post-Korean veterans eligible for new education benefits. But during the period of January 1955 through June 1966, veterans who entered the military after January 1955 were not eligible for any postservice benefits.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~The author's identification strategy [for the Korean War GI bill impact] is based on comparing postsecondary education among veterans who joined in the year following the cutoff. The author controls for education prior to military entry, among other background variables available in the major data source.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~…in comparing postsecondary education among veterans who joined up to a year before the January 31, 1955 cutoff date to postsecondary education among veterans who joined in the year following the cutoff, the author controls for education prior to military entry.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~…in comparing postsecondary education among veterans who joined up to a year before the January 31, 1955 cutoff date to postsecondary education among veterans who joined in the year following the cutoff, the author controls for education prior to military, among other background variables available in the major data source, the 1973 Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation (OCG).
410~D5~T7~Time Period~1973.0~…the year from which the Survey of Occupation Change in a Generation data was drawn.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~Slightly more formally, the author can represent an individual's level of postsecondary schooling in the absence of the Korean War GI bill subsidy as S(0i), and their education given eligibility for the Korean War GI bill subsidy as S(1i).
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~The OCG was administered in 1962 and 1973 as a supplement to the March CPS. Each male between 18 and 65 selected for the CPS sample was given a supplemental questionnaire concerning family background and their personal work and marital history. The 1973 questionnaire includes a range of questions on military background, such as dates of entry and exit, and years of education prior to military entry.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~The 1962 OCG questionnaire is not used because it does not have detailed questions on military service.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~The average impact of subsidy eligibility on postsecondary education can be represented as E[S(1i) - S(0i)]. The author cannot observe this statistic in a population of veterans who joined at exactly the same time, but the sharp benefits cutoff allows the observation of the following statistic for veterans entering the military between February 1, 1954, and January 31, 1956: E[S(1i)|V(i) =1, K(i) = 1, X(i)] - E[S(0i)|V(i) = 1, K(i) = 0, X(i)]. Here, V(i) = 1 indicates veteran status, K(i) = 1 indicates service during the year prior to the January 31, 1955, cutoff date which marked the end of Korean War education benefits, and X(i) is a vector of covariates. The fact that both groups were veterans allows the author to hold constant the effects of military service on educaiton, although the exact dates of service differ slightly. Equation (1).
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~A potential problem with this method is that changes in military slection could led veterans entering during the post-Korean War period to differ from veterans entering during the Korean War period in unobservable ways that affect schooling. This could result from changes in military selection, or perhaps entry into the military during the Korean War period by persons who were particularly interested in taking advantage of education benefits.
410~D1, D3~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~…V(i) indicates veteran status.
410~D1~V9~Variable~Service During Korean War Period~…K(i) indicates service during the year prior to the January 31, 1955 cutoff date which marked the end of Korean War education benefits.
410~D3, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Covariate Vector~…X(i) is a vector of covariates.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~The fact that both the Korean War group and the comparison group were veterans allows the author to hold constant the effects of military service on education, although the exact dates of service differ slightly.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~The author addresses the potential selection issue regarding this measure in several ways. First, the author searched military documents that discussed manpower and recruitment issues during the 1950s for any evidence that the January 1955 cutoff date corresponded to an independent change in military recruitment or selection procedures. The author found no evidence of such a change. Second, the author is able to control for a large set of background controls available in the OCG, including education and age prior to military entry and a full set of family background variables. Finally, the author also examines differences in education received after military discharge for a wide variety of years both before and after the January 1955 cutoff date.
410~D3, D4, D5~F3~Findings~Education post-Military Discharge~When examining differences in education received after military discharge for a wide variety of years both before and after the January 1955 cutoff date, the author finds that there is a consistent pattern of greater education enrollment after military discharge for all of the years in which the Korean War GI bill was in effect.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~A second issue is that even post-Korean War Veterans eventually became eligible for education benefits. Veterans joining after the January 1955 cutoff date were retroactively made eligible for the post-Korean war GI bill, which was passed in June 1966. The post-Korean War GI bill was quite similar to the Korean War GI bill, but slightly less generous. Thus, the simple difference in (1) estimates the effect of becoming eligible for veterans' benefits immediately upon military release compared with the effect of becoming eligible in 1966, creating a donward bias in the estimates of the total effects of GI bill benefits. One way to address this problem is by limiting the sample to veterans who exited well before 1966. The author also uses data on the months of post-Korean War GI bill funding received by veterans who were not eligible for the Korean War GI bill to estimate a rough correction for the effects of the post-Korean War GI bill on the impact estimates.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~…post-Korean War veterans eventually became eligible for education benefits. Veterans joining after the January 1955 cutoff date were retroactively made eligible for the post-Korean War GI bill, which was passed in June 1966. The post-Korean War GI bill was quite similar to the Korean War GI bill, but slightly less generous. The typical veteran qualified for about 24 months of funding under the post-Korean War GI bill, as opposed to about 36 under the Korean War GI bill. Real benefit levels under the 1966 legislation were about 90-95% benefit levels under the Korean War GI bill.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Impact of the GI Subsidy on Educational Attainment Across Social Classes~The availability of family background information in the OCG allows the direct examination of the effects of the GI bill subsidy on equalizing educational attainment across social classes.
410~D3, D5~DV7~Derived Variable~Social Class~The current measure of social class is family socioeconomic status (SES), a measure of income, prestige and social standing that is used often in sociological research.
410~D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Socioeconomic Status~The current measure of social class is family socioeconomic status (SES), a measure of income, prestige and social standing that is used often in sociological research.
410~D3~V10~Variable~Income~The current measure of social class is family socioeconomic status (SES), a measure of income, prestige and social standing that is used often in sociological research.
410~D5~V11~Variable~Prestige~The current measure of social class is family socioeconomic status (SES), a measure of income, prestige and social standing that is used often in sociological research.
410~D5~V12~Variable~Social Standing~The current measure of social class is family socioeconomic status (SES), a measure of income, prestige and social standing that is used often in sociological research.
410~D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Socioeconomic Status~…SES is defined using the occupation of each veteran's father. The author uses two broad family SES groups.
410~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Low SES~The low group includes all veterans whose fater had an SES equal to or below the median SES for the veteran's year of birth.
410~DV8~L10~Variable Value~High SES~The high group includes all others than the low SES qualifying group.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Impact of the GI Subsidy on Educational Attainment Across Social Classes~Using the simple notation from equation (1) and subscripts of H and L to represent high and low-SES families, the difference between the effects for the two SES groups is then {E[S(1H)|V(i) = 1, K(i) = 1, X(i)] - E[S(0H)|V(i) = 1, K(i) = 0, X(i)]} - {E[S(1L)|V(i) = 1, K(i) = 1, X(i)] - E[S(0L)|V(i) = 1, K(i) = 0, X(i)]}. The sharp benefits cutoff allows the author to observe an estimate of this difference for each SES subgroup by simply comparing Korean War and post-Korean War veterans within the subgroup. Equation (2).
410~D1, D3, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Impact of the GI Subsidy on Educational Attainment Across Social Classes~The estimates for eachincome group are obtained by interacting a categorical variable for veteran's status with categorical variables for high and low parental SES (the main effects of high and low SES are also controlled for). The difference in (2) is just the difference between these coefficients.
410~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Low SES~The low SES group generally represents about 55% of the population.
410~DV8~L10~Variable Value~High SES~…the high SES group generally represents about 45% of the population due to mass points in the SES distribution.
410~D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Socioeconomic Status~Percentile rankings are defined by comparing the veteran's father's SES to the SES of fathers of all other persons (veterans and civilian) born in the same two-year period. Low sample sizes prevent a finer division of SES gorups here. Veterans with no information on the father's SES are dropped.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~Tables II and III show descriptive statistics and results from estimating the difference in equation (1), using two different data sources and three different samples. The first sample is from the 1973 OCG, and consists of veterans who joined the military between February 1954 and January 1956 serving one to five years on active duty. The five-year limit ensures that veterans in this sample were released from the military no later than January 1961. As a robustness check the author also presents results from two other samples, both drawn from the 1978 Survey of Veterans (SOV). Because this survey contains only the date of military release, and not the date of entry, the author cannot re-create the 1973 OCG sample. The author has instead selected all veterans discharged between February 1955 and January 1961 and eliminated those with service prior to the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 or with less than one year of completed service before discharge.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~Tables II and III show descriptive statistics and results from estimating the difference in equation (1), using two different data sources and three different samples. The first sample is from the 1973 OCG, and consists of veterans who joined the military between February 1954 and January 1956 serving one to five years on active duty. The five-year limit ensures that veterans in this sample were released from the military no later than January 1961.
410~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Veterans~Tables II and III show descriptive statistics and results from estimating the difference in equation (1), using two different data sources and three different samples. As a robustness check the author also presents results from two other samples, both drawn from the 1978 Survey of Veterans (SOV). Because this survey contains only the date of military release, and not the date of entry, the author cannot re-create the 1973 OCG sample. The author has instead selected all veterans discharged between February 1955 and January 1961 and eliminated those with service prior to the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 or with less than one year of completed service before discharge.
410~D1~T8~Time Period~1978.0~…survey year from which Survey of Veterans data is drawn.
410~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Veterans~…the SOV data contains information on whether veterans entered the military through the draft or through volunteering. The author thus also presents information on a SOV subsample who entered the military through the draft. Since these men did not enlist willingly, it seems that they would be less likely to reflect voluntary selection into the military based on the desire to take advantage of benefits. Possible bias due to selection is lkely to be a less significant issue with the subsample.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~…the SOV data contains information on whether veterans entered the military through the draft or through volunteering. The author thus also presents information on a SOV subsample who entered the military through the draft. Since these men did not enlist willingly, it seems that they would be less likely to reflect voluntary selection into the military based on the desire to take advantage of benefits. Possible bias due to selection is lkely to be a less significant issue with the subsample.
410~D1, D3, D5~F4~Findings~Korean War GI Bill's Impact~The point estimates of the Korean War GI bill's impact in Table III are consistently significant, and also fairly consistent across the three samples. 
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~The regressions computing the impact of GI eligibility on postsecondary educational attainment include categorical categories for individual years of education upon military entry, and the OCG sample includes an extensive set of family background covariates.
410~D1, D3, D5~F5~Findings~GI Benefits, Higher Education, and Likelihood of Graduation~The various point estimates from Table III cluster around an impact of about a quarter of a year of higher education and a 5 to 6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of college graduation. This is a roughly 20% increase in higher education levels (calculated from the base levels of educational attainment in Table II). Based on the approximate reduction of 50% in higher education costs calculated for the Korean War GI bill in Table I, this implies an elasticity of postsecondary educaitonal attainment to the GI bill subsidy of around .4.
410~D5~F6~Findings~Korean War vs. Post-Korean War Sample~As Table II shows, in the OCG sample there do appear to be a few differences between the Korean War and post-Korean War samples in education prior to military entry. Although mean education is the same in the two groups, the post-Korean War sample is significantly less likely to have a high school degree at military entry. This difference does not exist in the SOV samples and may be due partially to random variation.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~As a final check on the robustness of these results, Figure I presents data from the OCG on postsecondary educaiton obtained after military exit for military entrants in all years for 1951 to 1958 serving between one and five years in the military. Data are from the 1973 OCG. A year of entry is defined as entry between February of that year and January of the next, so that samples for 1954 and 1955 correspond exactly to the sample used in the Table III model.
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~As a final check on the robustness of these results, Figure I presents data from the OCG on postsecondary educaiton obtained after military exit for military entrants in all years for 1951 to 1958 serving between one and five years in the military. The bottom line in the figure shows the unadjusted mean increase in postsecondary education after military exit for all entrants in that year. The top line shows regression-adjusted increases for the modal entrant in each year generated in the following manner: S(i) = [gamma](51) + [gamma](52) + ... + [gamma](58) + [Beta]X(i) + e(i), where S(i) is years of postsecondary education, [gamma](51) through [gamma](58) are a set ofyear effects, and X(i) is a vector of covariates including all the control variables used in Table III.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~…S(i) is years of postsecondary education.
410~D1, D3, D5~V13~Variable~Year Effects~…[gamma](51) through [gamma](58) are a set of year effects.
410~D3, D5~DV5~Derived Variable~Covariate Vector~...X(i) is a vector of covariates including all the control variables used in Table III.
410~D1, D3, D5~V13~Variable~Year Effects~Each year effect can be interpreted as the growth in postsecondary education for a typical (modal) military entrant in that year.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~According to the 1973 OCG, military entrants in 1956 and 1957 show an educational pattern that is quite similar to 1954 entrants.
410~D1, D3, D5~F7~Findings~Education at Military Entry for the Korean War vs. Post-Korean War Period~…there are no significant differences in education at military entry between Korean War and post-Korean War veterans in the 1978 SOV sample, although this may be due to the fact that the OCG and SOV samples do not represent exactly the same population.
410~D1, D5~F8~Findings~GI Benefits and Postsecondary Schooling~The regression-adjusted effects show that veterans entering in years where education benefits were available consistently show more postsecondary schooling after military release than similar veterans who did not have Korean War educational benefits available. The difference (about a fifth to a quarter of a year) is quite consistent from year to year. It does not seem to be driven by a sudden rush of enlistements by men who wished to have advantage of education benefits before the 1955 deadline. It is present even for military entrants in 1951, who could not have known the Korean War GI bill would pass and make them eligible for benefits.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV6~Derived Variable~Impact of the GI Subsidy on Educational Attainment Across Social Classes~Table IV addresses the question of difference in the GI bill subsidy impact across social classes. The table presents the edcuational differences between the control and comparison group broken out by parental socioeconomic status (SES), as explained in equation (2). The table uses the same OCG treatment and comparison group used in Tables II and III, and controls for the same set of background variables.
410~V4~L11~Variable Value~Modal Veteran~"""Typical"" is defined over the entire 1951-1958 period. The modal veteran in the sample had a high school degree but no college on military entry, was about twenty years of age at military entry, had parents with socioeconomic status around the median and with less than a high school education, and was born in the Middle Atlantic states."
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…all differential effects of Korean War GI bill models are linear models with robust standard errors.
410~D3, D5~DV8~Derived Variable~Socioeconomic Status~Socioeconomic status (SES) is defined using the Duncan measure of occupational status based on the father's occupation.
410~DV8~L10~Variable Value~High SES~High SES effect interacts Korean GI Bill eligibility with a dummy for father's SES greater than the median.
410~DV8~L9~Variable Value~Low SES~…low SES effect interacts GI bill eligibility with a dummy for father's SES less than or equal to the median.
410~DV8~L10~Variable Value~High SES~High SES corresponds to top 45% of SES distribution in each two-year period of birth, due to a mass point at the median.
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…the sample is 498 for all differential models.
410~D1, D5~F9~Findings~Postsecondary Education and SES Veterans~The Korean War GI bill appears to have had considerably higher causal effects on postsecondary education among higher SES veterans. The differences are especially strking for years of postsecondary educaiton, where they are statistically significant and large in magnitude. The difference in college graduation rate is not as large and is statistically insignificant. In fact, due to the lower base levels of college graduation among low SES veterans, the point estimates of responses for college graduation rates imply similar elasticities of college graduation for high and low SES veterans (although absolute effects are still significantly higher for high-SES vets).
410~D1, D3, D5~F10~Findings~Eligibility for Funding, Educational Attainment, and College Attendance~The difference in findings for years of college and college graduation rates suggests that eligibility for funding had a particularly large effect on those low SES veterans who did enroll in college, but had little impact on college attendance for low SES veterans. The final column in Table IV provides more evidence for this hypothesis, as do models (not shown) demonstrating that low-SES veterans were more likely to graduate college conditional on entry if they were in the GI bill eligible subgroup. The results were not greatly affected, and the differential between high and low SES impacts actually increased slightly.
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~As a check on potential selection bias, the author added a full set of interactions between parental SES and education at military entry to the models in Table IV. 
410~D1, D3, D5~F11~Findings~SES Distribution and the Causal Effect on Postsecondary Education~"…there is no evidence in the OCG that veterans from families in the bottom half of the SES distribution experienced a greater causal effect on postsecondary education from the Korean War GI bill than higher SES veterans did. If anything, the reverse seems to be the case. There are several possible reasons for this. The first is the availability of proprietary school vocational education under the Korean War GI bill. To the extent that veterans from lower income families were already invested in skills that were a complement to proprietary school education, the vocational school option may have drawn them away from college. A second (and related) potential explanation is that the distribution of the preceived ability to benefit from college was a more important factor than credit constraints in determining postmilitary college entry among lower income veterans. If the ability to benefit from college is also correlated with family income, then the distribution of causal effects from a subsidy that loosens credit constraints is indeterminate. The population most affected by the subsidy will be those with perceived levels of ability to benefit from college ""just below"" the ability level that justified college attendance for their presubsidy wealth level. Lower income groups may not have enough persons near the college ability margin to see large effects from the subsidy."
410~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Veterans~Table V gives some estimates of later use of the 1966 post-Korean War GI bill. The figures are from the 1978 SOV, which asks directly about the use and timing of veterans' benefits to pay for education.

410~D1, D3, D5~F12~Findings~Educational Benefits for Korean War and Post-Korean War Veterans~…the results of examining the impact of the 1966 post-Korean War GI bill show that educational benefits were indeed far more available to veterans with Korean service than to veterans who entered in the period immediately after the Korean War. Some 2% of non-Korean War veterans report Gi bill use within four years of military release. Since all of the non-Korean War veterans in the current sample report being released on or before January 1961, this should not be possible. It may be due to pure recall error, or to confusion between the start date of the educational spell and the start date of GI bill use among persons already in college in 1966 when the post-Korean War GI bill was passed. By 1973, well after the passage of the post-Korean War GI bill, the average number of months of postsecondary educational funding received by Korean War veterans is still over three and one-half times greater than the figure for post-Korean War veterans.

410~D1~DV9~Derived Variable~Average Months of GI-bill-funded College Education~GI-bill-funded college education was assumed for veterans who had attended college after military discharge and reported four or more months of GI bill educational funding.
410~D1~DV10~Derived Variable~Total Months of GI-bill-funded College Education~GI-bill-funded college education was assumed for veterans who had attended college after military discharge and reported four or more months of GI bill educational funding.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~…the fact that a small minority of veterans in the comparison group used the post-Korean War GI bill means that the straightforward treatment/comparison difference in Table III may be a slight understatement of the Korean War GI bill's effects. The author estimates the rough magnitude of this understatement by assuming that the average causal effect on postsecondary education of each month of post-Korean War GI bill funding is equal to the average causal effect of a month of GI bill receipt received from the Korean War GI bill. The author first calculated an approximate Wald estimator of the treatment effect of a month of GI bill funding on education. Then, adjustments for the comparison groups' use of GI funding were added to the impact estimate. The results of this technique are shown in the final rows of Table V.
410~D1, D5~DV12~Derived Variable~Understatement Magnitude~…the fact that a small minority of veterans in the comparison group used the post-Korean War GI bill means that the straightforward treatment/comparison difference in Table III may be a slight understatement of the Korean War GI bill's effects. The author estimates the rough magnitude of this understatement by assuming that the average causal effect on postsecondary education of each month of post-Korean War GI bill funding is equal to the average causal effect of a month of GI bill receipt received from the Korean War GI bill. The author first calculated an approximate Wald estimator of the treatment effect of a month of GI bill funding on education. Then, adjustments for the comparison groups' use of GI funding were added to the impact estimate. The results of this technique are shown in the final rows of Table V.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV13~Derived Variable~Wald Estimated Treatment Effect~…the fact that a small minority of veterans in the comparison group used the post-Korean War GI bill means that the straightforward treatment/comparison difference in Table III may be a slight understatement of the Korean War GI bill's effects. The author estimates the rough magnitude of this understatement by assuming that the average causal effect on postsecondary education of each month of post-Korean War GI bill funding is equal to the average causal effect of a month of GI bill receipt received from the Korean War GI bill.

Then, adjustments for the comparison groups' use of GI funding were added to the impact estimate. The results of this technique are shown in the final rows of Table V.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV13~Derived Variable~Wald Estimated Treatment Effect~…[Beta](2) is the Wald estimator of the impact of a month of GI bill funding, and [Beta](1) is the regression-adjusted estimate of the difference in education between the treatment and comparison group (from Table III). M(GI)^T is the mean months of GI bill funding received by the treatment (Korean service) group of veterans, while M(GI)^C is the average number of months of GI bill funding received by the comparison group.
410~DV9~L14~Variable Value~Average Months for Treatment Group~M(GI)^T is the mean months of GI bill funding received by the treatment (Korean service) group of veterans.

410~D1, D3, D5~F13~Findings~Post-Korean War GI Bill and the Impact of the Korean War GI Bill~Adjusting for post-Korean War GI bill use raises the estimated impact of the Korean War GI bill from approximately one-quarter to approximately one-third of a year of higher education. Making this upward adjustment to the Korean War GI bill's impact increases the estimated elasticity of years of higher education to the subsidy price reduction from roughly .4 to approximately .5.
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~The author checks the reliability of the results by simply using the estimate of the post-Korean War GI bill's impacts calculated in Angrist [1993]. Using Angrist's estimated impact per month of funding received produces a result very similar to the adjustment method explained above.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV13~Derived Variable~Wald Estimated Treatment Effect~This Wald estimator is mathematically equivalent to using the date of entry into the military as an instrument for months of GI bill funding received in a regression of completed education on GI bill funding received.
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in estimating the evidence on the WWII GI bill and postsecondary schooling, it is useful to begin by putting the different effects of military service on education in the WWII period into a simple regression framework. Consider a simple regression comparing veterans and civilians: S(i) = [alpha] + X(i)[Beta](1) + C(i)[Beta](2) + V(i)[Beta](3) + e(i). Equation (6).
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~…in the WWII model, each individual's years of postsecondary schooling S(i) is modeled as the sum of an intercept, effects from a vector of background variables X(i), a cohort of birth effect [Beta](2) that represents changes in educational availability and costs over time (including potential effects of the war period on education), and an effect [Beta](3) that is directly associated with a military service dummy V(i).
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…in the WWII model, each individual's years of postsecondary schooling S(i) is modeled as the sum of an intercept, effects from a vector of background variables X(i), a cohort of birth effect [Beta](2) that represents changes in educational availability and costs over time (including potential effects of the war period on education), and an effect [Beta](3) that is directly associated with a military service dummy V(i).
410~D3, D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Cohort of Birth Effect~…[Beta](2) in the WWII model represents a cohort of birth effect that represents changes in educational availability and costs over time (including potential effects of the war period on education).
410~D1, D3, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Military Service Effect~…[Beta](3) is an effect directly associated with a military service dummy V(i).
410~D1, D3, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Military Service Effect~The military service effect [Beta](3) conflates three separate sources of difference in education between veterans and civilians: The first is a selection effect driven by the preexisting differences between veterans and civilians that are not sufficiently controlled for in the vector of covariates X. The second is a direct effect of military service on education. the interruption of civilian life and the experience of service in the war may have their own effect on education decisions. Finally, the third effect is the subsidy impact created at the education margin by eligibility for the GI bill education subsidy.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Military Service Effect~Since the selection effect is probably quite positive, and is almost certainly more than enough to counterbalance any negative direct effects of military service on educaiton, the coefficient [Beta](3) is likely an overestimate of the GI bill's impact. Sot this regression coefficient can be seen as an upper bound on the true effect of the GI bill subsidy. 
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~The survey includes information on education prior to military entry for veterans. There are no similar data for civilians, but recalled education levels among veterans show that even prior to military entry they already had higher levels of education than nonveterans ever attained (this is true whether or not one conditions on family background). In addition, the mlitary selection process was designed to exclude the least fit and intelligent draftees.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Military Service Effect~To get a more conservative estimate of the subsidy impact, the author must somehow adjust this coefficient for the first two effects. Suppose that there was a comparison group of veterans that was not eligible for the GI bill, but was similar to eligible veterans in all other ways (including the selection and direct effects of their military service on education). Then equation (6) could be run on the comparison and treatment groups. Subtracting [Beta](3) for the comparison group from [Beta](3) for the treatment group would eliminate the selection and direct effects of military service and isolate the treatment effect of the GI bill subsidy on higher education.
410~D1~V1~Variable~GI Benefits~Since all veterans in the WWII period and the Korean War period immediately afterwards were subsidy eligible, no perfect comparison group exists. However, the author believes that WWII veterans born in the period from roughly 1921 to 1922 (who would have been in their early twenties when entering the military) do constitute a reasonable comparison group to use in estimating a lower bound for the subsidy's effects on younger veterans born from 1923 to 1926 (who entered the Army in their teens, or directly out of high school).
410~V4~L3~Variable Value~Older Veterans~Since all veterans in the WWII period and the Korean War period immediately afterwards were subsidy eligible, no perfect comparison group exists. However, the author believes that WWII veterans born in the period from roughly 1921 to 1922 (who would have been in their early twenties when entering the military) do constitute a reasonable comparison group to use in estimating a lower bound for the subsidy's effects on younger veterans born from 1923 to 1926 (who entered the Army in their teens, or directly out of high school).
410~V4~L4~Variable Value~Younger Veterans~Since all veterans in the WWII period and the Korean War period immediately afterwards were subsidy eligible, no perfect comparison group exists. However, the author believes that WWII veterans born in the period from roughly 1921 to 1922 (who would have been in their early twenties when entering the military) do constitute a reasonable comparison group to use in estimating a lower bound for the subsidy's effects on younger veterans born from 1923 to 1926 (who entered the Army in their teens, or directly out of high school).
410~D1, D3, D5~F14~Findings~Direct Effect of Military Service and Education~"The direct effect of military service on education may differ somewhat between the two groups. The absolute difference in age between the groups is small, but the causal effect of military service for the two groups might have differed if men in one cohort were more likely to have their schooling interrupted. It is not possible to directly measure the causal effect of military service on education but the 1973 OCG provides some circumstantial evidence on the matter. About 10.4% of veterans in the 1921-1922 cohort and 11.1% of veterans in teh 1923-1924 cohort were ""potentially"" college students who did not continue college educaiton after military service, and therefore may have had their college education interrupted. These figures are quite close, which provides some evidence that any negative ""interruption effect"" of military service on higher educaiton was not dramatically different between the two cohorts."
410~V4~L3~Variable Value~Older Veterans~…at least some of the veterans born in 1921-1922 did have their college attendance decisions affected by GI bill eligibility. For this reason, using these veterans as a comparison group will lead to an underestimate of the true effects of the GI bill subsidy on younger veterans, since some of the true impact will be differenced out. The author therefore uses the 1921-1922 comparison group to generate a lower bound for the GI bill's impacts on higher education.
410~V3~L2~Variable Value~Lower Bound~…at least some of the veterans born in 1921-1922 did have their college attendance decisions affected by GI bill eligibility. For this reason, using these veterans as a comparison group will lead to an underestimate of the true effects of the GI bill subsidy on younger veterans, since some of the true impact will be differenced out. The author therefore uses the 1921-1922 comparison group to generate a lower bound for the GI bill's impacts on higher education.

410~D5~T9~Time Period~1962, 1973~Table VI presents descriptive statistics on veterans and civilians among two-year birth cohorts of men born between 1909 and 1927, using a merged sample of the 1962 and 1973 OCGs.
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Table VII runs the regression from equation (6) separately for each birth cohort. The first column reports the coefficient [Beta](3) on veterans' status after adjusting for family background and race covariates. The second column reports the coefficient after adding additional controls for work history (occupation of first full-time job and age at which the first full-time job was obtained) as of 1940 or before, and marital history (age at first marriage) in 1940 or before for all cohorts aged 18 or over in 1940. Since the United States did not enter WWII until December 1941, data from 1940 or before can safely be taken as exogenous to military service.
410~D1, D3, D5~DV15~Derived Variable~Military Service Effect~Table VII runs the regression from equation (6) separately for each birth cohort. The first column reports the coefficient [Beta](3) on veterans' status after adjusting for family background and race covariates. The second column reports the coefficient after adding additional controls for work history (occupation of first full-time job and age at which the first full-time job was obtained) as of 1940 or before, and marital history (age at first marriage) in 1940 or before for all cohorts aged 18 or over in 1940.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~Both the 1962 and 1973 OCGs include extensive questions on work and marital history for all respondents. The OCG also asks veterans about education prior to military entry.
410~D5~D5~Dataset~Survey of Occupational Change in a Generation~The survey asks veterans their level of education prior to military entry and whether they had ever obtained a full-time, full-year job prior to military entry. The author assumes that men who recall at least a high school degree at military entry and had never had a full-time, full-year job prior to military entry represent the pool of men who were possibly enrolled in college at military entry. The author then observes what fraction of these potential college students did not continue their postsecondary education after military exit.
410~V7~L25~Variable Value~1927.0~The 1927 cohort is limited to one year because there is very limited WWII service among the 1928 cohort, who were essentially all volunteers. Most men born in the latter half of 1927 were also volunteers.
410~D3, D5~V7~Variable~Birth Cohort~Table VI presents descriptive statistics on veterans and civilians among two-year birth cohorts of men born between 1909 and 1927, using a merged sample of the 1962 and 1973 OCGs.
410~D1, D3, D5~F15~Findings~College Graduation, Postsecondary Education, and Extraneous Commitments~The assumption that the raw coefficient on veterans' status is an upper bound for the impact of the GI bill subsidy immediately yields some strong conclusions. For cohorts born in 1920 or before, the effect does not appear to be large. After adjusting for available prewar covariates, the remaining effect on college graduation is very small and statistically insignificant. The effect on years of postsecondary education received is quite limited, under 10% with an implied elasticity of a bit under .15. Since some 50% of WWII verterans were born prior to 1921, this finding is important. These findings support the contention above that older veterans showed much smaller effects of the subsidy offer, and are consistent with the belief that commitment to a career and family sharply raised the opportunity costs of college entrance during this period.

410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~…for the WWII GI bill impact analysis, Regression 1 controls for father's education (five categories), father's occupation (nine categories), father's SES (six categories), year of birth, and region of birth (ten categories). All categories are fully interacted with the OCG year and cohort of birth. Regression 2 controls for all the variables from regression 1, plus categorical variables for age at first FTFY job if obtained before 1941, SES of first FTFY job if obtained before 1941, age at first marriage if before 1941, and categorical variables for no marriage or job prior to 1941.

410~D1, D3~F16~Findings~Exposure to GI Bill Subsidies by Age Group~"Figure II uses Census data and shows that the sudden increase in the veteran/civilian education differential among mid-1920s cohorts is a robust result that can be found in simple Census regressions as well, where the magnitude is also similar to that shown in Table VII. These younger cohorts, who entered the military immediately after high school, were in a sense the ""most exposed"" to the GI bill subsidy, since they had the lowest opportunity cost of taking advantage of it."
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Table VIII summarizes the impact estimates and elasticities drawn from the Table VII results. The upper bound is simply drawn from the Table VII coefficient. The lower bound is produced by using the 1921-1922 cohorts as a comparison group for the 1923-1926 cohorts. As a check on the OCG results, the author also shows the lower bound generated by using the 1921-1926 cohorts in the pooled 1960-1970 Censuses in the last row of the table. Both lower bounds are generated by differencing the coefficient for veterans' status in the pooled 1923-1926 cohorts from the coefficient for 1921-1922 cohorts. Essentially identical results come from comparing only the 1923-1924 cohorts with 1921-1922 cohorts.
410~V3~L1~Variable Value~Upper Bound~Table VIII summarizes the impact estimates and elasticities drawn from the Table VII results. The upper bound is simply drawn from the Table VII coefficient. The lower bound is produced by using the 1921-1922 cohorts as a comparison group for the 1923-1926 cohorts.
410~V3~L2~Variable Value~Lower Bound~Table VIII summarizes the impact estimates and elasticities drawn from the Table VII results.  As a check on the OCG results, the author also shows the lower bound generated by using the 1921-1926 cohorts in the pooled 1960-1970 Censuses in the last row of the table. Both lower bounds are generated by differencing the coefficient for veterans' status in the pooled 1923-1926 cohorts from the coefficient for 1921-1922 cohorts.
410~D1, D3, D5~F17~Findings~Bounds of the GI Bill's Effect~The lower bound estimate of the GI bill's effect from Table VIII implies about a 20% increase in postsecondary education among the peak cohorts of veterans born between 1923 and 1926 due to the GI bill. (The inclusion of statistical uncertainty would of course greatly widen this estimate, but it remains above zero.) The upper bound is about a 50% increase in education. Applying the Korean War GI bill range of roughly .4 to .5 elasticity for years of college to a subsidy offer would give an increase of about 25% to 30% in years of college among veterans due to the WWII GI bill. For veterans born between 1909 and 1920, increases in education are much smaller, less than 10%, and for the 1921-1922 cohorts the simple correlation from Regression 2 in Table VII implies an upper bound of about a 15% to 20% increase.
410~D1~D1~Dataset~Survey of Veterans~It is possible to check the plausibility of the upper and lower bounds in Table VIII using administrative data from the WWII period on college degrees granted.
410~D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Growth Rate~It is possible to check the plausibility of the upper and lower bounds in Table VIII using administrative data from the WWII period on college degrees granted. This approach is inspired by Olson [1974]. For each year from 1930 to 1952, the author calculated D(t), the number of four-year college degrees granted to males in year t divided by the male population aged 21 in year t. For each year in the WWII period, the author simulated alternative lower and upper bound values of D(t), D(Lt), and D(Ut), that represent likely levels of undergraduate degree receipt among males in the absense of the GI bill and presence of WWII.
410~D1, D3, D5~T10~Time Period~1940-1952~The WII period is defined to include the years 1940 to 1952; during 1940 to 1945 college graduation was negatively impacted by the war, while during 1946 to 1952 degrees granted wer increased by the number of returning veterans who obtained their degrees late.
410~D4~V25~Variable~Number of College Degrees~For each year from 1930 to 1952, the author calculated D(t), the number of four-year college degrees granted to males in year t divided by the male population aged 21 in year t.
410~D4~DV16~Derived Variable~Counterfactual Growth Rate~The average annual growth rate in D(t) over the 1930 to 1940 period is used as the lower bound growth rate R(L), and the 1936 to 1940 growth rate is used as the upper bound R(U).
410~D3, D4, D5~F20~Findings~Growth Rates, Rebound Effects, and College Degree Receipt~"The 1930 to 1940 growth rate of 1.7% annually is low, as it includes the negative effects of the early part of the Depression on education. This growth rate corresponds to assuming that the negative effects of WWII on college degree receipt were similar to those of the Depression. The 1936 to 1940 annual growth rate of 5.1% is very rapid, probably partially as a ""rebound effect"" from the early part of the Depression and also due to rapid rises in high school education created by various factors during the Depression period. This upper bound growth rate corresponds to the assumption that there were no negative effects of WWII on college degree receipt compared with trends that existed just prior to the war."
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~F21~Findings~Plausibility Assumption Results~"The ""bottom line"" of the plausibility simulation is easily summarized. The actual figures, the result of both WWII and the GI bill, show that an estimated 12.7% of men turning 21 during the 1940-1952 period received four-year undergraduate degrees. The ""lower bound"" estimate, based on a continuation of 1930-1940 trends over the wWII period, gives the result that 10.4% of men turning 21 over the 1940-1952 period would have received college degrees. The upper bound estimate results in 12.8% of men receiving college degrees. In other words, growth in college degrees continued at its most rapid prewar pace over the entire WWII period. Given the interruption in education created by the war (e.g., the slowdown in the growth rate of high school graduation levels), it seems highly unlikely that the rapid prewar growth rate in college graduation would have continued over the WWII period in teh absence of the GI bill."
410~D4~F22~Findings~Counterfactual Growth Rates in Undergraduate Degrees~If the correct counterfactual growth rate in undergraduate degrees over the WWII period in the absence of the GI bill is the annual increase observed over the 1930-1940 period, this implies a 22% increase in degrees granted among males due to the WWII GI bill, for a .37 elasticity of college graduation to the GI bill subsidy. This is approximately the lower bound previously estimated above. In addition, the simulation results may be somewhat lower than those in the previous sections, as they are based on the effect of the WWII GI bill on all BA degrees earned over the entire 1940-1952 period.
410~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~Some results of this analysis are shown in Figure III, which in a sense summarizes the author's results on the equalizing effects of the midcentury GI bills.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~In Table IX the author does a detailed breakout of higher eduation attainment by SES quintile over the WWII period.
410~D3, D4, D5~F23~Findings~SES Distribution and Growth in Higher Education Degree Receipt~The author finds that men born among the bottom 45% of the SES distribution show essentially no unusual growth in higher education associated with the peak WWII GI bill period. In fact, growth in postsecondary education for the bottom two quintiles is more or less stagnant over the 1921-1926 birth cohorts, after showing fairly marked growth before it. Almost all of the considerable growth in postsecondary education during 1921-1926 occurs in the top half of the SES distribution. The fourth quintile shows the greatest absolute and percentage growth in education. There is no evidence of an equalizing effect of the WWII GI bill on higher education across social classes.

This makes a substantial difference in the results. The author also omits master's and doctoral degrees, since the appropriate population to use as a denominator for these degrees is unclear.

410~D1, D3, D5~F24~Findings~Mean Years of Postsecondary Education Among Eligible Korean War Veterans~…the results in Tables III and V correspond to an increase of roughly 20% to 25% in mean years of postsecondary education among eligible Korean War veterans. These point estimates, if they roughly hold for peak period Korean War veterans joining a few years earlier, imply that the Korean War GI bill raised average postsecondary attainment by about 13-15% among all men born in the peak Korean War service years of 1930 to 1933. Estimates for the program's effects on college graduation rates are somewhat larger. 
410~D1, D5~DV4~Derived Variable~Impact of GI Eligibility on Postsecondary Education~As an example of the method the author used to calculate this measure, using the 1970 Census a 20% increase in years of postsecondary education for Korean War veterans born in 1931 gives roughly .2 additional years of education for these men. Assuming a zero GI bill effect for nonveterans, multiplying this educational increase by the fraction of men serving in Korea (62%) gives a roughly .12 increase in educaiton when spread across the entire male population. Given the measured average postsecondary education among men in this cohort, this figure implies a 13% increase. The author uses similar calculations for the rest of the paper when giving a percentage increase in overall education caused by the GI bill among an entire cohort of males.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~There were two basic methods by which individuals entered military service during WWII: volunteering and induction through the draft. Volunteering was permitted on an unlimited basis through December 1941. From December 1942 through August 1945, volunteering was prohibited, but continued on a limited basis for seventeen-year old men. Beginning in September 1945, volunteering was again permitted and became common. During this period, the service had a policy of only recruiting men aged 18 to 25. Prior to December 1942, roughly one-third of inductions into the army came through voluntary enlistments. From January 1943 through August 1945, which was the period when overall inductions were highest, about 12% of inductions were voluntary enlistments. From the cessation of hostilities in September 1945 until the officially declared end of the war in 1947, voluntary enlistments became the major source of military manpower; some three-quarters of soldiers were supplied this way. Overall, about 70% of WWII veterans entered through the draft.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~Liability for military induction was always limited by age (both formally and informally), but varied throughout the war. In the beginning of the war, men aged 45 or over were automatically excused from service. As the war went on, strong preferences for younger men (especially those from 18 to 25 years of age) were put in place.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~After men were called up, local draft boards decided wheter to induct them or grant them a deferment or exemption from military service. Men over the age of 30 were granted deferment and exemptions of all sorts much more readily than younger men were. Deferments became much more difficult to obtain as the war went on and manpower needs increased. There was no general deferment for college students during WWII. The four most significant categories of deferments and exemptions were mental defects, physical defects, employment deferments, and agricultural deferments. For men in their midtwenties or below during 1943 or after, the last two deferments were very difficult to get unless there was evidence of mental or physical defects.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~The system of induction and deferments during the Korean War was generally similar to that used in WWII, but there were several differences. Major differences were in the treatment of age, the existence of new deferments, and standards for occupational and agricultural deferment. Other standards remained as described above. In addition, volunteering was permitted throughout the Korean War; about half of all entries to the army during the period came through voluntary enlistment. However, many of these enlistments occurred after a man was informed of draft selection (volunteering permitted selection of service branch, which draftees could not do). So draft pressure probably played an important role for the majority of inductees.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~Draft liability in the Korean War was limited to those between the ages of 18.5 and 25. Younger men were permitted to volunteer.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~There were several new deferments and exemptions added during the Korean War period. There was a deferment available for males with dependent children under ertain circumstances. During the war, about 15-20% of all nonveteran males in military liable age groups were deferred due to dependency. The Korean War draft also introduced the concept of a general college studnet deferment. The deferment was not uncommon, but it was by no means automatic. in 1953 roughly one-seventh of male college students were classified as deferred from service due to college enrollment. In addition, college students could delay induction until the end of the current academic year of enrollment. Finally, the Korean War draft nearly eliminated deferments for skilled industrial workers and greatly reduced them for agricultural workers.
410~D1~V8~Variable~Veteran Status~After the June 1953 cease-fire, the military began a sharp personnel reduction that stabilized in 1956. There were some 560,000 total inductions into the military in 1953, but this dropped to 270,000 in 1954 and 214,000 in 1955. Draft calls continued, but only for the Army (which was the least desirable service). Throguhout the Korean War and post-Korean War period, military enlistment was driven by Defense Department requirements, not demand for service by civilians.
410~D3, D4, D5~V3~Variable~Educational Attainment~"An important concern for the current results is whether men entered specifically to gain education benefits, especially during the post-Korean War period just before the benefit cutoff. In this context, it is important to recognize that eligibility for education benefits was not a certainty after the June 1953 cease-fire. After this point, the close of the ""official"" Korean War period could have occured at any date, and according to the original 1952 legislation no benefits at all would be provided for service after the close of the Korean War period."

411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~In this paper, researchers step back from the highly charged rhetoric and address this question with the two primary data sources for looking at compensation of state and local government workers: the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Stastistics, and the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) microdata collected as part of the National Compensation Survey (NCS) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The fundamental difference between these two sources of data is that the CPS is a household survey while the ECEC is a survey of employers.
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~In this paper, researchers step back from the highly charged rhetoric and address this question with the two primary data sources for looking at compensation of state and local government workers: the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Stastistics, and the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) microdata collected as part of the National Compensation Survey (NCS) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The fundamental difference between these two sources of data is that the CPS is a household survey while the ECEC is a survey of employers.
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~Data from the NCS have been used in studies of union-nonunion, interindustry, and occupational wage differentials and in studies of compensation inequality. However, while NCS publications regularly present tabulations separately for the private sector, on the one hand, and state and local government, on the other, the microdata fromt he NCS have not been previously used to compare compensation in the private sector to that in the state and local government sectors.
411~D1, D2~DV1~Derived Variable~Pay Differences~Researchers begin by presenting some tabulations on pay differences across sectors from the two data series - both raw pay differences between public and private sectors and also some breakdowns by education level of workers (for the Current Population Survey) and skill level of the job (for the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation series).
411~D1~V1~Variable~Education Level~Researchers begin by presenting some tabulations on pay differences across sectors from the two data series - both raw pay differences between public and private sectors and also some breakdowns by education level of workers (for the Current Population Survey) and skill level of the job (for the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation series).

411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~In both data sets, the workers being hired in the public sector have higher skill lebvels than those in the private sector, so the challenge is to compare across sectors in a way that adjusts suitably for this difference. Researchers look at current wage and compesnation gaps, trends in these gaps over time, and public-private differentials at different points of the distribution. Researchers explore a number of methodological choices appearing in the literature, like whether or how to adjust for occupation or the size of an employer, and seek to understand which of these choices are important.

Researchers explore a number of methodological choices appearing in the literature, like whether or how to adjust for occupation or the size of an employer, and seek to understand which of these choices are important.
411~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Earnings Differentials by Sector~After controlling for skill differences and incorporating employer costs for benefits packages, researchers find that, on average, public sector workers in state government have compensation costs 3-10% greater than those for workers in the private sector, while in local government the gap is 10-19%. Researchers caution that this finding is somewhat dependent on the chosen sample and specification, that averages can obscure broader differences in distributions, and that a host of worker and job attributes are not available in the data. Nonetheless, the data suggest that public sector workers, especially local government ones, on average, receive greater remuneration than observably similar private sector workers. Overtruning this result would require strong arguments for particular model specifications, or different data.
411~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~Raw Wage Gap~Some tabulations for the raw wage gap between employees of state and local government and private sector employees are provided in Tables 1A and B. The first three columsn of each table show the proportions of employment for state government, local government, and private sector workers, and then average hourly and weekly earnings by sector.
411~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Raw Wage Gap by Sector~In both datasets, the raw wage gap shows public sector workers being paid more. In the Current Population Survey data, the raw wage gap in hourly earnings is about 4%; in the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data, hourly wages in the government sectors exceed those in the private sector by an average of about 30%.
411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"The Current Population Survey is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households. In any given month, one adult household member reports employment and other information for each member of the household. A subset of households reports earnings and hours information. these are the ""outgoing rotation groups,"" and each year since 1979 these interviews are gathered together into a single Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) file. the CPS-MORG includes demographic information on schooling and age, and information on jobs held such as industry, occupation, and the employer's sector, including state government, local government, or private sector. For the CPS panel, Table 1A, the final five columns show a breakdown by education level."

411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~The NCS is a longitudinal establishment survey of nonfederal and nonagricultural employers. Interviewers visit newly sampled establishments and obtain information on the establishment and the jobs of a random sample of workers in the establishment. Jobs are defined using the employerr's most narrow occupational classification or job title and other dimensions, including union coverage and full-time status. Information on individuals' earnings, job work schedules, and job work levels is collected, but demographic information on job incumbents is not.
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~"Because this survey captures information on the number of hours per week and weeks per year that employees in a job are scheduled to work, this information can then be used to convert earnings and compensation into hourly statistics. However a potential problem arises here: the information on hours reflects employers' conceptions of scheduled work time. In most cases, work schedules are standard and easy to collect. However, an important exception for this study involves primary and secondary school teachers, whose actual hours worked per week are generally not available because time spent in lesson preparation, grading, and other nonclassroom activities are not available to employers. These data use the length of workday as specified by contract (""contract hours"") for teachers in determining the work scheudle, but given that, on average, teachers work more hours than their contract requires, the estimates of hourly earnings will be higher than if actual hours could be used. Because of this measurement issue, researchers primarily analyze weekly earnings shown in the third column of the table, and researchers also restrict samples to full-time jobs (to help control for differences in weekly hours). "
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~"When analyzing Employer Costs for Employee Compensation hourly earnings, researchers exclude certain occupations where contract hours are prevalent.

"
411~D2~F3~Findings~Weekly Earnings by Sector~With the weekly earnings sample, state and local government earnings exceed those of the private sector by around 16-20% in the ECEC.
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~Although the National Compensation Survey does not collect information on education and experience by employee, the information is on job levels can be used to compare pay at different skill levels across government and nongovernment jobs. This situation arises because the President's Pay Agent - an interagency group consisting of the Secretary of Labor and the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management - uses the National Compensation Survey data to compare rates of pay for federal workers to nonfederal rates of pay, as called for by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. For this reason, NCS interviewers assign a level of work to all jobs in the survey, which ranges from 1 to 15, corresponding to pay levels in the General Schedule system.

411~D2~V2~Variable~Skill Level~Although the National Compensation Survey does not collect information on education and experience by employee, the information is on job levels can be used to compare pay at different skill levels across government and nongovernment jobs. The NCS interviewers assign a level of work to all jobs in the survey, which ranges from 1 to 15, corresponding to pay levels in the General Schedule system.
411~V2~L1~Variable Value~13-15~…only a small amount of employment is at the highest work levels (13-15).
411~D2~F4~Findings~Work Levels of Sector Distributions~It is immediately apparent that a far higher fraction (0.513) of employment in the private sector is in the bottom category of work levels (1-4) than is the case for the local (0.281) and state governments (0.197). Again, this means that controlling for skill differences across sectors should substantially reduce estimated pay gaps.
411~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Distribution of Employment~Figure 1 presents, for the ECEC, the distribution of employment across eight occupational grtoups, formed by aggregating the 22 two-digit occupations in the Standard Occupational Classifications.

411~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Occupation~To focus on occupations that are important in government, Education remains split out from other professional occupations, while Protective Service is kept separte from other Service. The occupational groups are ordered from high earnings at the top to low earnings at the bottom, based on earnings from all sectors combined.
411~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Skill Differences and Sector Distributions~Consistent with the skill differences evident in Table 1A and B, the government proportions tend to be higher in the occupations at the top, and the private shares greater in those occupations at the bottom. Highlighting the difficulty of making private-government comparisons, even at this level of aggregation, some occupations, such as sales, are virtually all private, while others are almost all public. Differences between state and local government are also evident, with state governments having higher concentrations in Professional and Management, and local government being disproportionately represented in Education. As one might expect, this coarse level of aggregation hids some interesting distinctions.

411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~The ECEC data converted to a cost-per hour-worked average for incumbents within a job. It should be noted that these data can be difficult for a respondent to report. As an example, there is a certain amount of measurement error involved in getting job-specific data for some of the components of the ECEC because respondents are sometimes able to report data only for a broader group than the job incumbents, such as the average for all white-collar workers or for all workers. To give another example, it is quite difficult to price out the defined benefit pension obligations associated with current employees, and the NCS typically reverts to employer expenditures, which will depend on account funding rules and plan asset investment returns. It is possible that these kinds of measurement errors are not randomly distributed across the data, but, instead, that certain errors are more common in certain sectors.
411~D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Benefits Costs~It is commonly understood that nonwage benefits form an important part of public sector compensation packages. Government workers are much more likely to be offered health insurance and retirement plans, and are more likely to enroll in such plans if offered. In addition, public sector plan structures tend to offer more comprehensive coverage. Public sector health plans tend to require lower employee contributions and have higher employer premiums, and are more likely to come bundled with supplemental dental, vision, or prescription drug plan components. Private sectore retirement plans, when offered, are typically defined contribution plans rather than higher-cost defined benefit plans. Furthermore, differences exist within retirement plan type; for example, public sector defined benefits plans are more likely to include post-retirement cost-of-living adjustments. Public workers are also more likely to be eligible for retiree health benefits.
411~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Qualitative Differences in Benefits Factors and Employer Costs~"Table 2 shows that qualitative differences in benefits factor into employer costs. As the table indicates, the costs per hour worked for the various benefits collected are much greater in the public sector (about $14) than in the private sector (around $8). Spending on health insurance in the government ($4.30 at the state level and $4.56 at the local level) is more than double tht in the private sector ($2.14), while expenditures on retirement and savings are more than triple ($3.18 and $3.37 versus $1.00). Within retirement and savings, the vast majority of spending in government goes toward defined benefit plans, while in the private sector, the breakdown is much more even between defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Paid leave is also more generous in government, more than double the private sector level in state government and more than 50% higher in local government. For the remaining category of ""other benefits,"" which includes nonproduction bonuses, short- and long-term disability benefits, and all legally required benefits, the private sector has an edge. Two explanations for this are that bonuses tend to be higher in the private sector and that not all government workers are covered by Social Security."

411~D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Benefits Costs~"Researchers caution that different benefits profiles do not automatically indicate that public sector plans are ""too generous."" It seems plausible that public sector workers demand a compensation package skewed more towards benefits. After all, they have higher incomes and are older and more educated. More speculatively, they may have preferences such as greater risk aversion or different rates of time preference that would induce greater demand for retirement and health insurance benefits. There may be contract design issues related to optimal retirement dates and specific human capital accumulation that make defined benefit plans more sensible for public sector workers. Furthermore, public sector employers almost certainly find plan provision cheaper due to economies of scale - for example, by avoiding some adverse selection issues in health insurance tha plague small private firms."
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~…the current authors believe that the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (from the National Compensation Survey) contain valuable information for the problem at hand. They come from from a representative sample, comprehensively cover the benefit spectrum, and are derived from employer and administrative records. While more work is undoubtedly needed on reconciling household and establishment surveys, researchers believe the National Compensation Survey likely contains more accurate data on wages, industry, occupation, and sector than does the Current Population Survey.

411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~The two main regression-based approaches in the literature are the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and a dummy variable approach, where wages are a function of the covariates and indicator variables for the different sectors.

411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~For the purposes of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, researchers specify that where for sector j, which can be state, local, or private, and individual k, [gamma](jk) is either a wage or compensation measure, X(jk) is a vector of characterisics and [Beta](j) is the corresponding coefficient vector for the relevant sector, and e(jk) is an error term with mean zero and variance [sigma](j)^2. 
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~…researchers use the coefficients from this regression to estimate the log wage or log compensation that the average public sector worker would earn in the private sector, either state or local. Denoting the government and private sectors with subscripts g and p respectively, differences in sector-average log wages or compensation would be decomposed into an explained portion or composition effect, and an unexplained remainder, the wage structure effect. This unexplaind portion shows how much more or how much less an average public sector worker would earn in the private sphere (absent any general equilibrium effects on the private wage structure associated with workers changing sectors). Researchers therefore take what a public worker would earn in the private sector to the relevant counterfactual to the worker's actual public sector earnings.

411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~In regressions using data from the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, researchers control for differences in human capital via a series of dummy variables for work level. Therefore, researchers assume that individuals, on average, possess the requisite skills to fill the positions and that these skills would carry over to the private sector.
411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…an implausible 10.1% of Current Population Survey state government workers are in elementary, middle, and secondary school teaching occupations, versus 0.3% in the National Compensation Survey, suggesting some difficulty in CPS reports or imputations of sector of work or occupation.
411~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Union Coverage~Researchers treat union status and organizational size as not reflecting worker skills. Controlling for union coverage seems inappropriate, because union wage premia probably do not reflect ability differences, and those in the public workforce would not likely that their public sector unionization rates with them if they were to move to the private sector.
411~D2~V13~Variable~Organizational Size~Researchers treat union status and organizational size as not reflecting worker skills. The situation is murkier in the case of employer size, because less of a consensus exists as to causes of the size premium. The traditional explanation has been that large employers have greater product market power, and that workers capture some of these rents. If, however, employee compensation rises with the size of employer because large employers hire better-quality workers - that is employer size is a proxy for unobserved worker ability, even in the public sector - then including size as a control is desirable.
411~D1, D2~V6~Variable~Occupation~If occupation reflects unmeasured human capital and working conditions common to the private and public sectors, then including occupation controls will help net out cross-sectional differences in the wage-influencing factors. But as Belman and Heywood discuss, even if one believes that occupation controls are imortant, it is not obvious how fine one should go: coarse controls may leave occupations too heterogeneous, while finer controls can remove unique occupations from the analysis. Given the lack of consensus, researchers present models with different treatments for occupation.

The first column in each pair in Table 3 presents the log differences and, the second, the percentage differences, where the percentage differences are relative to public sector statistics. In this section, researchers discuss differentials in terms of log points because the Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions is in terms of logs. In later sections, researchers adopt a somewhat looser approach and only display percentage differences. Researchers present both log differentials and percentage differences because they measure different things. See the online Appendix available with this article at (http://e-jep.org) for details on how researchers use log wage regression results to derive estimated differentials in percentage terms. Asterisks are used to indicate statistical significance at the 1 and 5 percent levels.
411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…private-public pay differentials for weekly wage and compensation are based on data from the 2009 Current Population Survey, Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (CPS-MORG) file and data from the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) sample in the 2009 National Compensation Survey (NCS). Samples are restricted to full-time workers or full-time jobs for these models. Estimates are private-public differentials in log points and percentage differences. Unexplained differentials are from Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions that net out sectoral differences in controls, using private sector returns. Base controls in the CPS include sex, Census division interacted with metropolitan area, four education dummies, and a quartic in experience.

When detailed occupation controls are included, the raw differentials cometimes deviate slightly from the raw differential provided because occupations for which there are government workers but no private sector workers are excluded.
411~D1~F7~Findings~Earnings by Sector and Human Capital Accumulation in the ECEC~Beginning with estimates based on the Current Population Survey Data, researchers see that the raw average earnings of state workers exceed those of private workers by about 0.09 log points and that the earnings of local government workers surpass those of private workers by about 0.10 log points. However, after including the baseline controls for education, experience, sex, full-time status, and the interaction of Census division with metropolitan area, it is private sector workers who appear to earn more than their state and local government equivalents, by 0.11 and 0.08 log points respectively. The implication of this regression is that public sector workers earn more on average than private sector workers because public sector workers have higher levels of human capital, particularly education - not because they receive higher pay for a given level of human capital.
411~D1~V14~Variable~Sex~Base controls in the CPS include sex.

411~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Census Division x Metropolitan Area~Interacting Census division with metropolitan area is more flexible than just including Census division and metropolitan area dummies by themselves in that the metropolitan-nonmetropolitan differential is allowed to vary by division.
411~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Occupational Differences and Relative Pay by Sector~…if one takes into account major occupation differences in the Oaxaca Blinder Decompositions using the two-digit level of the Standard Occupation Classification systems (which contains 22 occupations), the estimates change markedly. With a swing of 0.171 log points from the base control case, relative pay estimates now favor local government workers, who are paid 0.091 log points more than can be explained by the controls. For state workers, the shift from the base control case is smaller (0.113 points), so that the gap in log points virtually disappears. These results using major occupational controls indicate that, conditional on the baseline variables - especially schooling levels - government workers are more likely to be in lower-paying two-digit occupations than their private sector counterparts. College-educated government workers are in less-lucrative two-digit occupations (like teaching) than their private counterparts, who are more likely to be health care practitioners or in areas like business and management. On the other end of the educational spectrum, those without a high school degree in the private sector are more likely to be in the relatively lucrative (conditional on schooling) production and construction occupations. 
411~D1~F9~Findings~Detailed Occupational Differences and Relative Pay by Sector~Moving from two-digit occupational controls to the most detailed occupational controls contained in the Current Population Survey - consisting of nearly 500 occupations - relative pay differentials shift about 0.02-0.03 log points in favor of private sector workers, so that private sector workers are 0.020 log points above the state government workers, while local government workers are about 0.067 points above the private sector. Of course, the models with and without occupational controls represent very different thought experiments.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~Readers who believe it likely that, say, college-educated teachers and managers have different levels of unmeasured human capital will tend to gravitate toward the models controlling for occupation. They will prefer to compare, conditional on schooling and other factors, teachers to teachers, and indeed they may prefer to compare elementary school teachers to elementary school teachers via detailed occupational controls. the alternative view is that it is more useful to make across-sector comparisons unconditional on occupation: perhaps occupation does not accurately reflect unmeasured skills, and occupational controls only exacerbate difficulties from (say) unmeasured differences in pecuniary or nonpecuniary factors.
411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the data from the Current Population Survey does not provide an unambiguous answer to the question of whether comparable workers receive higher wages in the public sector.
411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…the Current Population Survey does not contain comprehensive information on nonwage benefits.
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~…for comprehensive information on non wage benefits, one must turn to the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation microdata.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~The baseline controls used in the regressions with the NCS Employer Costs for Employee Compensation microdata are as similar as possible to those in the Current Population Survey. However, in these regressions, instead of controlling for education and experience, researchers control for job work levels.
411~D2~F10~Findings~Baseline Raw Differentials in the ECEC~As already noted in Table 1, the baseline raw differentials are wider in the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) microdata. As shown in the third column of Table 3, the state and local government raw weekly earnings gap is 0.203 and 0.246 points, respectively, above the private sector. Using the base controls, which in this case include job work levels, private sector jobs with the same characteristics as state sector jobs pay about 0.048 log points more, which is smaller than the 0.108-point difference based on Current Population Survey data in column 1. For local government jobs, the ECEC results suggest an edge in pay for public sector workers of 0.054 points versus the estimate of a 0.080-point advantage for the private sector in column 1. In general, the explained portions of the raw wage gaps are larger in the ECEC than in the CPS, which suggests that the work-level information provides more information about skill differences across jobs than is apparent in the demographic data about workers in the Current Population Survey. However, the remaining unexplained wage gap between private sector and local government workers indicates that local government workers are paid higher wages, and this is a departure from CPS-based studies that routinely find the opposite.
411~D1, D2~F11~Findings~Occupational Conrols in the ECEC vs. CPS~"Because the work-level data were designed to make different jobs comparable adding occupational controls does not affect the measured public sector premia as much in the ""NCS weekly wage"" column as it did with the Current Population Survey data in the first set of columns, where education level is the main control. With detailed occupational controls, there is little ground between the state and the private sector, but a difference of 0.115 log points remains in favor of the local government."
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~…the work-level data were designed to make different jobs comparable.
411~D1, D2, D3~F12~Findings~Nonwage Compensation and Raw Differentials in the ECEC~"When nonwage compensation is included, as in the ""NCS weekly compensation"" columns of Table 3, the raw differentials widen markedly in favor of the state and local government workers. The state differential widens by 0.132, to 0.355 points, and the local differential by 0.101, to 0.347 points. When compensation is the dependent variable, the regression-adjusted estimates move (relative to the NCS weekly wage column) by almost as much as the raw differentials in favor of government workers. This shift tends to fall in the range of 0.10-0.12 log points."
411~D2~D2~Dataset~Employer Costs for Employee Compensation~"Are government jobs more highly compensated than corresponding private sector jobs? The answer from the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation microdata appears to be ""yes,"" although the magnitude of the difference depends upon sector of government and specification used."
411~D2, D3~DV5~Derived Variable~Benefits Costs~Nonwage compensation in state and local government exceeds that of the private sector.
411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~…data on private-public percentage pay differentials for hourly wage and compensation come from the 2009 Current Population Survey, Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (CPS-MORG) file and data from the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) sample in the 2009 National Compensation Survey (NCS).

411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~Unexplained differentials are from Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions that net out sectoral differences in controls, using private sector returns.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~…base controls in the regressions estimating the private-public percentage pay differentials for hourly wage and compensation are as in Table 3, but also include indicators for full-time workers or jobs.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~In Table 4, researchers present the results of the same specifications as in Table 3, except this time using an hourly wage or compensation sample, rather than a weekly one. To save space, researchers report the results only in percentage terms, which is what most recent studies do, though it is cautioned that these other studies may not convert from log points into percentages in the manner performed in the current research.
411~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Ordinary Least-Squares~In the online Appendix available with this article at (http://e-jep.org), researchers describe a methodology that first determines what the average level of benefit costs would be if private sector returns are applied to public sector characteristics and then calculates the ratio of this quantity to the actual average of public sector benefit costs.
411~D2, D3~F13~Findings~Work-Level Differences and Raw Differentials in the ECEC~After controlling for work-level differences, the sectoral differences in health insurance costs are approximately 30-40%, and the analogous differences in retirement and savngs costs are perhaps 50%, as measured relative to the public sector costs.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~…relative to simply exponentiating the log differentials, the current method of conversion adds 2 to 4 percentage points in favor of the private sector, depending on the specification.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~The hourly results serve both as a sensitivity check, and provide an opporutnity to reconcile the results with earlier studies.
411~D1~F14~Findings~Union Coverage and Hourly Wage Sample Estimates~In the first column of table 4, with the Current Population Survey hourly wage sample, researchers estimate that, with the base controls but without occupational controls, the wages of the private sector exceed those of the state government by 12.4% and exceed those of the local government by 11.0%, magnitudes which are somewhat lower than their counterparts in the weekly sample. When researchers experimented with including union coverage in the covariates for the purposes of reconciliation, the gaps widen to 18% to 19% in favor the private sector.
411~D1, D2~V7~Variable~Union Coverage~…researchers prefer not to control for union status, because they doubt it reflects ability that is portable across sectors.
411~D2~V13~Variable~Organizational Size~Government is a large employer, and so the inclusion of employer size means that more of the raw differential in favor of government will be viewed as size effect rather than a government effect, making it more likely that private sector workers will be viewed as overpaid.
411~D2~F15~Findings~Organizational Size and Raw Differentials~In the ECEC data, adding establishment size to the baseline controls shifts differentials by roughly 6 percentage points in favor of the private sector for wages and by about 8 points for compensation, although it is difficult to say whether the effect would be of the same magnitude in the CPS.
411~D1, D2~F16~Findings~Occupational Indicators and Hourly Wage Sample Estimates~The inclusion of occupational indicators in hourly wage regressions moves the relative pay estimates in a direction favorable to government workers, as it did in Table 3, so that state workers are about even with those in the private sector, while local government workers are estimated to earn 5.7% more than their private sector conterparts.
411~D1, D2, D3~M1~Methodology~Oaxaca Blinder Decomposition~The final two columns of Table 4 display the results for the NCS Employer Costs for Employee Compensation hourly sample, which excludes teachers because of the difficulties in knowing their actual hours worked, as explained earlier. 
411~D2~F17~Findings~ECEC Hourly Sample Estimates~…the results from the NCS Employer Costs for Employee Compensation hourly sample regression analysis, which excludes teachers because of the difficulties in knowing their actual hours worked, for state government hourly wages are not much much different than the comparable ones for weekly wages. For local government, the exclusion of teachers and other occupations for which weekly hours are unreliable narrows the raw differential by about 6 percentage points. For the baseline regressions, the hourly and weekly results are also similar, but that is not the case for the regressions with occupational controls, as the estimated edge for local government workers narrows from 9% to 10% at both levels of occupational detail to about 7% with two-digit controls and 5% with detailed controls.

The hourly compensation differentials are between 3% and 10% in favor of state government workers and 13% to 18% in favor of local government employees, depending on the specification.

411~D4~D4~Dataset~Employment Cost Index Series~...researchers look at the relative growth rates of private and public sector compensation, after controlling for changes in employment composition in jobs in each of these sectors. To do this, researchers make use of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index (ECI) series, which are based on the same microdata as the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation. Researchers first take the quarterly private sector ECI indexes for wages, benefits, and total compensation and base each at 100 for December 1981. Researchers base the corresonding public sector ECI indexes in the same manner.

411~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~There were several changes in Current Population Survey data over the 1979-2009 period, including a 1994 redesign that altered earnings questions and a lack of allocation flags in certain years. Some of the more important changes involve coding for schooling and occupation. Researchers use the base controls specification to skirt changing CPS occupational coding schemes. The CPS education questions changed in 1992, and researchers use the approach suggested by Jaeger (1997) to code workers as consistently as possible into five education groups.

411~D4~DV21~Derived Variable~Employment Cost Index~The Employment Cost Index is a Laspeyres index for employer costs, with cells defined by industry and occupation. Quarterly rates of change are calculated within each cell using jobs that are in sample both quarters. See Bureau of Labor Statistics (n.d.) for details on the construction of the ECI series. In this figure, researchers use a combined public sector, combining state and local government. Researchers thank Tom Moehrle for constructing these series, which are not seasonally adjusted.
411~D3~T4~Time Period~1980s~…a period when relative private pay was decreasing.
411~D3~T5~Time Period~1990-2005~…a period from roughly 1990 to 2005, when relative pay was fairly stable or, if anything, the private sector was gaining on the public sector.
411~D3~T6~Time Period~2005-Present~…a period when relative private pay is again faling - though not as fast a rate as in the first period. The third period also differs from the first in that benefits account for a greater portion of total compensation gains (for the public sector relative to the private sector) in the third period than in the first.
411~D2, D4~DV20~Derived Variable~Ratio of Public to Private ECI~Figure 3 can be divided roughly into three parts: 1) the 1980s, when relative private pay was decreasing; 2) from roughly 1990 to 2005, when relative pay was fairly stable or, if anything, the private sector was gaining on the public sector; and 3) 2005 to the present, when relative private pay is again falling - though not as fast a rate as in the first period. The third period also differs from the first in that benefits account for a greater portion of total compensation gains (for the public sector relative to the private sector) in the third period than in the first.
411~D1, D2~F20~Findings~Relative Compensation Series~The relative compensation series shifts 4-5% over the last five years. If the analysis on 2009 data in the previous section was possible a half-decade earlier, the findings would likely reflect smaller public-private compensation differentials. Unlike earlier periods, much of the recent shift depends on relative benefit cost changes.
411~D1, D2~M2~Methodology~Dummy Variable Approach~The dummy variable approach uses a single log linear regression equation. Again, for sector j, which can be state, local, or private, and individual k, [gamma](jk) is either a wage or compensation measure, X(jk) is a vector of characteristics, and [Beta] is the corresponding coefficient vector, which does not differ by sector. This specification also includes S(k) and L(k), which are dummy variables for state and local government with corresponding coefficients [delta](s) and [delta](l). In this case, the coefficients on the two sector dummy variables directly provide the log differentials between state government pay relative to private pay (the omitted variable), and between local government pay and private pay. Table 5 gives estimates of this specification, with major occupation controls, using quantile regressions. Since researchers are estimating differentials at particular points in the distribution, here a simple exponentiation of the public sector coefficients is appropriate for deriving percentage differences, and researchers present these estimates in Table 5.
411~D1, D2~V16~Variable~State Government~…S(k) is a dummy variable for state government.
411~D1, D2~V17~Variable~Local Government~…L(k) is a dummy variable for local government.

411~D1, D2~DV23~Derived Variable~Local Government Effect~…the corresponding coefficient to the L(k) dummy variable in dummy variable approach specifications.
411~D1~F21~Findings~Private Sector Premiums in the CPS Data~In the Current Population Survey data in the first row of Table 5, consistent with expectations, the private sector premium rises as one moves across the columns, through the distribution of weekly earnings. Below the median, the private sector premium is negative (higher relative pay for state and local government), but, at the 90th percentile, the private sector premium is 11.7% relative to state government and 9.0% versus local government.
411~D2~F22~Findings~Private Sector Premiums in the ECEC Data~In the rows of Table 5 based on the Employer Costs for Employee Compensation earnings and compensation microdata, the same movement (as found in the CPS data) in favor of the private sector is evident as one moves up the quantiles, but the interquantile spread is narrower in the ECEC than in the data from the Current Population Survey. In the CPS, there is a spread of 16.2 percentage points between private-public percentage differentials in the 10th and 90th percentiles for the state government and one of 19.5 points for the local government. In the ECEC, the private sector premium for weekly earnings relative to state workers is 0.9% at the 10th percentile versus 7.5% at the 90th percentile, a difference of only 6.6 percentage points. The spread across the quantiles in the bottom row (ECEC weekly compensation, private-local government) is a somewhat larger 9.2 percentage points, yet even at the 90th percentile, compensation for private sector workers is lower than that for local government workers, by 10.5%.
411~D1, D2, D3~F23~Findings~State and Local Government Worker Pay vs. Private Sector Worker Pay~Are state and local government workers better paid than similar workers in the private sector? When considering wages only, the answer is ambiguous. When researchers add nonwage compensation, however, public sector workers do appear to be better compensated, although the magnitude of the difference depends upon which sector of government is being considered and the degree to which occupations are controlled for. With no controls for occupations, researchers estimate that compensation in state government is higher than in the private sector by 3.2% in the weekly sample and 3.7% in an hourly sample. Local government workers are even more highly compensated, with the differential being 10.5% in the weekly sample and 12.9% in the hourly sample. The addition of occupation controls, particularly those for two-digit occupations, serves to widen the premium for the government. One should not that none of these results control for establishment size.
411~D2~V13~Variable~Organizational Size~Such a control, in models with detailed occupation, tends to reduce the private-local government compensation differentials, and approximately equalizes the compensation of state and private sector workers.

412~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1940-1996~An analysis of aggregate changes in the relative supplies and wages of workers by education from 1940 to 1996 indicates strong and persistent growth in relative demand favoring college graduates. Rapid skill upgrading within detailed industries accounts for most of the growth in the relative demand for college workers, particularly since 1970. Analyses of four data sets indicate that the rate of skill upgrading has been greater in more computer-intensive industries.
412~D1, D5, D6, D7, D8~DV1~Derived Variable~Technological Change~Technological change and capital-deepening appear to have been associated with increased demands for more-skilled workers for many decades implying that correlations of technology indicators and the usage of more-skilled workers in the 1980s do not necessarily imply an acceleration in the impact of skill-biased technological change.
412~D1, D5, D6, D7, D8~DV1~Derived Variable~Technological Change~Progress in evaluation the skill-biased technological change hypothesis for recent increases in U.S. educational wage differentials requires (1) using a framework that incorporates both shifts in the relative demand and relative supply of skills, (2) examining a sufficiently long time frame to determine whether factors viewed as important in the 1980s were absent in other periods with different relative wage movements, and (3) looking at the relations among observable technology indicators and skill upgrading over such a longer time frame. Researchers attempt such an assessment in this study.

412~D1, D2~F1~Findings~Secular Relative Demand Growth Favoring College Workers~Substantial secular relative demand growth favoring college workers over the past five decades is necessary to reconcile an increase in the log college/high school wage differential of 0.25 (approximately 0.55% annually) from 1950 to 1996 with a more than threefold increase in the employment share of college graduates. The data are less clear on whether the trend rate of demand growth for more-educated workers has increased since the 1970s. Relative demand growth appears to have been more rapid than usual in the 1980s, but its pace appears to have slowed considerably in the 1990s. The current framework suggests that the relative demand for more-skilled workers grew more rapidly during the past 26 years (1970-1996) than during the previous three decades (1940-1970) This conclusion is sensitive to the inclusion of the 1940s, a decade of sharp wage compression, in the earlier era. Nevertheless, a substantial increase in the growth rate of the within-industry component of the relative demand for college workers is apparent from the 1960s to the 1970s, with this higher within-industry growth rate maintained into the 1980s and 1990s.
412~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Wage~Rising educational wage differentials and within-group wage inequality are both substantial contributors to the growth in overall U.S. wage inequality since the late 1970s. Although the college wage premium and within-group inequality move similarly during the 1980s, they are distinct outcomes and appear to have evolved somewhat differently in other periods. It should be remembered that researchers analyze changes in the college wage premium and not changes in overall wage inequality.

412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Researchers further explore the role of skill-biased technological change in the growth of the relative demand for more-skilled workers from 1960 to 1990 by linking data from multiple sources on industry workforce composition, physical capital intensity, research and development expenditures, computer investments, and (for manufacturing industries) trade penetration and foreign outsourcing.
412~D5~F2~Findings~Skill Utilization Among Computer Industries~In exploring the role of skill-biased technological change in the growth of the relative demand for more-skilled workers from 1960 to 1990, researchers consistently find for both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors that increases in the utilization of more-skilled workers are greater in the most computer-intensive industries, although it is not clear whether a causal interpretation of these relationships is appropriate.
412~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Supply~To explore whether an explanation for the large expansion in U.S. educational wage differentials since the late 1970s appears to be driven by an acceleration of relative demand shifts favoring more-skilled workers, researchers put the recent experience into a longer-term perspective.

412~D1, D2~F3~Findings~Educational Attainment of the Workforce~The educational attainment of the workforce has increased rapidly throughout the 56-year period examined. Table I documents a dramatic decline in the share of those with less than a high school degree and a more than fourfold increase in the share of hours worked of college graduates and those with some college. Despite the continuing large increase in the relative supply of more-educated workers, the log college/high school wage differential has grown substantially (by 0.25) since 1950. Thus, sharp secular increases in the relative demand for more-educated workers are essential to explain such a pattern in a supply-and-demand framework in which workers with different amounts of education are imperfect substitutes in production.
412~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College+/High-School Wage Premium~The log college/high school wage premiums presented in Table I are estimates of the log hourly wage differential for college graduates (those with sixteen or more years of schooling) relative to high school graduates (those with exactly twelve years of schooling) adjusted for changes in the demographic compositions of the two groups and for changes in the distribution of years of schooling of college graduates.

412~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College+/High-School Wage Premium~The log college-plus/high schol wage differential in each period is a weighted average of the estimated college (exactly sixteen years of schooling or a B.A. degree) and postcollege (17+ years of schooling or a postbaccalaureate degree) wage premium relative to high school workers (those with exactly 12 years of education or a high school diploma) in the indicated years, where the weights are the relative employment shares of college and postcollege workers in the 1980 Census (for Census samples) and 1980 MORG file (for CPS samples).

412~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Wage~"Panel B of Table I displays annual rates of chnages in the relative earnings and quantity of college workers by decade. The basic approach is to examine the relative wage of two ""pure"" skill groups (college graduates and high school graduates) and to relate the evolution of this relative wage to changes in the relative quantities and demands for ""equivalents"" of these pure skill classes. This two-labor-input framework over simplifies the analysis of relative wage determination, but it leads to broad conclusions that are similar to more disaggregated approaches such as used by Katz and Murphy [1992] and Murphy and Welch [1992]."
412~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Supply~Panel B of Table I displays annual rates of chnages in the relative earnings and quantity of college workers by decade. Researchers summarize the relative quantity of labor by education by converting all workers into college and noncollege workers. Researchers use two different classification schemes: (1) college graduates and all other workers; and (2) college equivalents (college graduates plus half of those with some college) and high school equivalents (half of those with some college plus workers with twelve or fewer).
412~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Supply~"The large increases in the educational attainment of the U.S. workforce since 1940 may overstate increases in the relative supply of ""more-skilled"" workers to the extent that the ""unobserved"" quality of more-educated workers declines the some ""relabeling"" of ""lower productivity"" workers into higher edcuation cartegories."
412~D1, D2~DV2~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Wage~Table II attempts to more formally assess alternative relative supply and demand shift scenarios for the observed pattern of changes in the relative wages and relative quantities by education from 1940 to 1996. Researchers use a simple two-factor framework in which they assume an inelastic (predetermined) short-run relative supply function and a downward sloping relative demand function.

412~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Supply~Information on changes in the log ratio of the wage bill of college graduates to the wage bill of noncollege workers and on changes in the (composition-adjusted) relative wage of college graduates can be used to draw inferences concerning the rate of growth of the (composition-adjusted) relative supply and the relative demand for college graduates across time period.

This point can be illustrated by considering a simple CES production function for aggregate output Q with two factors, college equivalents (c) and high school equivalents (h) where N(ct) and N(ht) are the quantities employed of college equivalents and high school equivalents in period t, a(t), and b(t) represents skilled and unskilled labor-augmenting technological change, [alpha](t) is a time varying technology parameter that can be interpreted as indexing the share of work activities allocated to skilled labor, and p is time invariant.The aggregate elasticity of substitution between college and high school equivalents is given by [sigma] = 1/(1 - p).

412~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Supply~The relative supply changes tabulated in the third and fifth columns of panel A of Table II and the second and fourth columns of panel C of Table II are the difference between the changes in the relative wage bill and the change in relatie college-plus/high school wages. See the Data Appendix for details.
412~D5~DV20~Derived Variable~Ratio of Marginal Products~Under the assumption that the economy operates on its labor demand curve so that college and high school equivalents are paid their marginal products, researchers can use (1) to solve for the ratio of marginal prodcuts of the two labor types, yielding a relationship between relative wages (w(ct)/w(ht)) and relative supplies (N(ct)/N(ct)) given by log(w(ct)/w(ht)) = (1/[sigma])[D(t) - log (N(ct)/N(ht))] where D(t) indexes relative demand shifts favoring college equivalents and is measured in log quantity units. The impact of changes in relative skill supplies on relative wages depends inversely on the magnitude of aggregate elasticity of substitution between the two skill groups. Equation (2).

412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Changes in D(t) can arise from pure skill-biased technological change, nonneutral changes in the relative prices or quantities of nonlabor inputs such as computer services, increased outsourcing possibilities that disproportionately affect the two skill groups, and shifts in product demand from either domestic or international sources.
412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Solving equation (2) for D(t) and rearranging terms yields Equation (3). D(t) = log([w(ct)N(ct)]/w(ht)N(ht)]) + ([sigma]-1)log(w(ct)/w(ht)). Equation (3) implies that changes in the log relative demand for college equivalents equals the sum of the change in the log relative wage bill and a term that depends positively (negatively) on the change in the log college wage premium when [sigma] > 1 ([sigma] < 1). If [sigma] = 1, then changes in the log relative demand for college equivalents are directly given by changes in the log relative wage bill of college workers.

412~D1, D2~DV3~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Supply~The 1970s is the outlier decade in terms of relative supply growth. The rate of growth of the log relative supply of college workers accelerates dramatically in the 1970s and then decelerates substantially in the 1980s and 1990s under either classification scheme.

412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Panel C of Table II compares changes in the growth of the college relative wage, supply, and implied demand (assuming that [sigma] = 1.4) for selected aggregated time periods.
412~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Aggregate Elasticity of Substitution~The base case assumption of [sigma] = 1.4 implies that the sharp differences in the behavior of the college relative wages in the 1970s and 1980s can be attributed to both slower relative supply growth and faster relative demand growth in the 1980s.
412~D1, D2~F4~Findings~College Wage Premium Trends~A comparison of the period of large increase in the college wage premium from 1980-1996 with the period of little change from 1960-1980 suggests that a deceleration in relative supply growth is more important than an acceleration in relative demand growth in explaining the recent expansion of educational wage differentials. A marked decrease in the rate of growth of relative demand is apparent in the 1990s, and the compression of educational wage differentials in the 1940s is attributed to slow (and possibly negative) relative demand growth for college workers.
412~D1, D2~F5~Findings~Secular Relative Demand Growth and Wage Premiums~Overall, Table II implies that strong secular relative demand growth for college workers since 1950 is necessary to reconcile that large increases in the college wage premium in the face of large relative skill supply increases. The data do not lead to an unambiguous answer to the question of whether the trend rate of demand growth has increased recent. Under the researchers' preferrred estimate of [sigma] = 1.4, theyu find that the growth in the relative deamnd for college equivalents is rather steady from 1950 to 1980, unusually fast in the 1980s, and rather slow in the 1990s. The hypothesis of an acceleration in relative demand growth in the 1980s is supported by assuming that [sigma] is in the range of recent estimates (1.3 to 1.7). But the slowdown in demand growth in the 1990s is suprising given the continuing spread of computers and large growth of U.S. trade with less-developed countries in the 1990s.
412~D1, D2~F6~Findings~Average Rate of Growth of Relative Demand for College Workers~Panel C of Table II does indicate that the average rate of growth of relative demand for college workers was more rapid during the past 26 years (1970-1996) than during the previous 30 years (1940-1970). This conclusion is dependent on including the 1940s, a decade of strong instituional intervention in the labor market, in the earlier period. Furthermore, the decadal comparisons in panel B of Table II as well as annual time series data from the March CPSs do not indicate a discrete trend break in demand growth for the more-skilled in the 1970s.
412~D1, D2, D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Decomposition of Growth of the Share of Aggregate Employment~A decomposition of the growth of the share of aggregate employment (or of the aggregate wage bill) accounted for by college graduates into between- and within-industry components can help illustrate the potential importance of these alternative channels. A standard decomposition of the change in the proportion of group j (college graduates) in aggregate employment between years [tau] and t ([delta]P(jt) = P(jt) - P(j[tau])) into a term reflecting the reallocation of labor across sectors and a term reflecting changes in the college graduate share of employment within industries where k indexes industries, E(jkt) is the employment of group j in industry k in year t as a share of aggregate employment in year t, E(kt) is total employment in industry k in year t, [gamma](jkt) = E(jkt)/E(kt) is the group j share of employment in industry k in year t, [gamma](jk)=([gamma](jkt) + [gamma](jk[tau]))/2 and E(k) = (E(kt) + E(k[tau]))/2. The first term ([Delta]P(jt)^b reflects the change in the aggregate proportion of college graduates attributable to changes in employment shares between industries that utilize different proportions of college graduates. The second term ([Delta]P(jt)^w) reflects within-industry skill upgrading. An analogous decomposition can be performed to analyze changes inteh aggregate wage-bill share of college graduates.
412~D1, D2, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Decomposition of Growth of the Aggregate Wage Bill~A decomposition of the growth of the share of aggregate employment (or of the aggregate wage bill) accounted for by college graduates into between- and within-industry components can help illustrate the potential importance of these alternative channels.

412~D1, D2, D3~DV23~Derived Variable~Decomposition of Growth of the Aggregate Wage Bill~Table III presents between- and within-industry decompositions of both the growth in the share of employment and of the wage bill accounted for by college graduates from 1960 to 1996 using 140 three-digit industries (made consistent among 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 Census Industry Codes).
412~D2~F7~Findings~Between-Industry Components of the Wage-Bill Share~The between-industry components of the change in the college wage bill and employment share are greatest in the 1960s mainly as a results of the rapid growth of the college-intensive education and public administration sectors. The decline in the between-industry component in manufacturing in the 1990s appears related to substantial declines in employment of educaiton-intensive industries greatly affected by defense downsizing. The vast majority of the secular growth in the utilization of college graduates can be attributed to within-industry changes.

412~D1, D2, D5~F8~Findings~Growth of Employment, Wage-Bill Shares, and Within-Industry Skill Upgrading~An acceleration in the growth of the employment and wage-bill shares of college graduates in the 1970s and 1980s relative to the 1960s is driven by within-industry increases. The rate of within-industry skill upgrading remains high in the 1990s. In fact, the within-industry growth in the college wage-bill share (as well as the college employment share) is faster in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s than in the 1960s in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. Thus, the pace of within-industry skill upgrading appears to have increased starting in the 1970s, but the precise time pattern is somewhat different in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. A large increase in the within-industry growth of the college wage-bill share occurs from the 1960s to the 1970s outside of manufacturing. A further sharp increase from the 1970s to the 1980s is apparent in manufacturing.
412~D1, D2, D3~DV22~Derived Variable~Decomposition of Growth of the Aggregate Wage Bill~Under some strong assumptions, researchers can use the shift-share decompositions of the growth of the college wage-bill share to more directly measure the extent to which the growth in the relative demand for college workers reflects skill-biased technological change as opposed to product demand shifts across industries with different skill-intensities. 
412~D3~DV31~Derived Variable~Industry Output~Following Bound and Johnson (1992), researchers assume output of each industry k(Q(k) depends on the employment of college and high school equivalents according to a CES production function of the form of equation (1) with a common elasticity of substitution ([sigma] = (1/(1 - p)) but with the other technology parameters ([alpha](kt), a(kt), and b(kt)) varying by industry and time. 
412~D3~DV32~Derived Variable~Relative Demand for the Output of Industry k~The relative demand for the ouptut of industry k relative to a reference industry r in period t is assumed to be given by Q(kt)/Q(rt) = [theta](kt)(P(kt))^[epsilon] where P(kt) is the price of Q(kt) relative to Q(rt) and [theta](kt) is a parameter that reflects consumer tastes and other factors (such as foreign competition) affecting relative product demand for the output of industry k in year t.
412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Katz and Autor (1998) show in the special case of a Cobb-Douglas economy ([sigma] = [epsiolon] = 1) that eggregate log relative demand for college workers (D(t)) is given by the log relative wage bill of college workers (as in equation (3) with [sigma] = 1) and can be decomposed into a between-industry component that depends only on product demand shifts (changes in the [theta](kt)'s) and a within-industry component that depends only on the pace of skill-biased technological change (changes in the [alpha](kt)'s).
412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Under the Cobb-Douglas assumptions the change in the within-industry component of the log realtive demand for college graduates measures the impact of skill-biased technological change on relative demand growth and can be directly calculated from the within-industry componentn of the shift share decomposition of the college wage-bill share given in panel B of Table III.
412~D1, D2, D3~F9~Findings~Cobb-Douglas Approach Implications~The Cobb-Douglas approach implies that the annual percentage change (100 times the annual log change) in the within-industry component of the relative demand for college graduates (for all industries) is 1.60 in the 1960s, 2.98 in the 1970s, 2.84 in the 1980s, and 2.51 from 1990 to 1996 (using Census data for 1990 and CPS data for 1996). Thus, the rate of within-industry relative demand growth for college graduates appears to have increased from the 1960s to the 1970s and remained at a higher level in the 1980s and 1990s. This restrictive Cobb-Douglas framework suggests a larger impact of skill-biased technological change on the growth relative demand for college workers from 1970 to 1996 than in the 1960s.

412~D5~DV30~Derived Variable~Within-Industry Skill Upgrading~Product market shifts may occur within three-digit industries leding to shifts in production across firms with different skill intensities and possible within-firm changes in product and skill mixes.
412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~Cobb-Douglas estimates of this measure are based on combining the within-industry component of college wage-bill share growth for all industries in Panel B of Table III with information in Panel B of Appendix 1 on the level of college wage-bill share at the start of each period. Let Y(c) and Y(c) equal the aggregate wage-bill shares for college graduates and noncollege workers. If [sigma] = 1, then equation (3) implies that the change in the log relative demand for college workers can be written as [Delta]D(t) = [Delta]log(Y(ct)/Y(ht)) = log(1 + [[Delta]Y(ct)/Y(c[tau]]) - log(1 + [[Delta]Y(h[tau])/Y(h[tau]).
412~D1, D5, D6, D7, D8~DV1~Derived Variable~Technological Change~The diffusion of computers and related technologies is a possibly important measurable source of changes in the relative demand for skills which has been operating for at least several decades. Computer technology may influence relative labor demand in several ways. Computer business systems often involve the routinization of many white-collar tasts. Simple, repetitive tasks have proved more amenable to computerization than more complex and idiosyncratic tasks. Microprocessor-based technologies have similar facilitated the automation of many production processes in recent years. Thus, direct substitution of computers for human judgment and labor is likely to have been more important in clerical and production jobs than in managerial and professional jobs. Computer-based technologies may also increase the returns to creative use of greater available information to more closely tailor products and services to customers' specific needs and to develop new products. The direct substitution and organizational complementarity channels both predict that an increase in the relative demand for highly educated workers should be associated with computerization.
412~D1, D2~DV5~Derived Variable~College/High School Relative Demand~If researchers drop the Cobb-Douglas assumption of [sigma] = [epsilon] = 1, then a decomposition of demand shifts into between- and within-industry components no longer clearnly separates out the effects of product demand shifts and technological change on relative labor demand. But, more generally, the aggregate elasticity of substitution between college and noncollege labor equals the industry-level elasticity of substitution when [sigma] = [epsilon]. Then under the preferred estiamte of [sigma] = 1.4, researchers can adjust the within-industry component of log college relative wage-bill growth for changes in relative wages using equation (3) to generate an estimate of the within-industry component of the growth in log relative demand.
412~D1, D2~DV18~Derived Variable~Aggregate Elasticity of Substitution~…the aggregate elasticity of substitution between college and noncollege labor equals the industry-level elasticity of substitution when [sigma] = [epsilon]. Then under the preferred estiamte of [sigma] = 1.4, researchers can adjust the within-industry component of log college relative wage-bill growth for changes in relative wages using equation (3) to generate an estimate of the within-industry component of the growth in log relative demand.
412~D1, D2, D3~F10~Findings~Within-Industry Component for the Relative Demand for College Graduates~…in the case of adjusting the within-industry component of log college relative wage-bill growth, the annual percentage change in the within-industry component of the relative demand for college graduates is 1.88 in the 1960s, 2.68 in the 1970s, 3.44 in the 1980s, and 2.67 from 1990 to 1996. Thus, this scenario leads to similar conclusions to the Cobb-Douglas case concerning an increased rate of within-industry relative demand growth starting in the 1970s.
412~D1, D5, D6, D7, D8~DV1~Derived Variable~Technological Change~Researchers do not view the spread of computers as simply increasing the demand for computer users and technicians, but more broadly as a part of a technological change that has altered the organization of work and thereby more generally affected the demand for workers with various skills. The computer revolution may thereby be an important component of secular increases in the relative demand for skilled worker in recent decades.
412~D1, D2~T1~Time Period~1940-1996~Although computer technology dates back to at least the 1940s, microprocessors first were introduced on a wide scale in manufacturing machinery in the 1970s. The diffusion of organizational applications of computers accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s and continues at a rapid rate to the present day. With the birth of the Apple II in 1977 and the IBM PC in 1981, personal computers (PC's) spread rapidly in the 1980s and the early 1990s. The historical patterns of the spread of computers suggests that computerization is likely to have affected relative skill demand sin the service sector prior to its major impacts in manufacturing. This prediction appears consistent with the findings presented in Table III of a more rapid increase in within-inustry skill upgrading outside of manufacuring from the 1960s to the 1970s and in the manufacturing sector from the 1970s to the 1980s.

412~D1~F11~Findings~Prevalence Computer Use at Work~The prevalence of computer use at work increased almost linearly from one quarter of the work force in 1984, to over one third in 1989, and to nearly one half in 1993 - an average increase of 2.4% of the workforce per year.
412~D1~F12~Findings~Computer Use at Work Across Demographic Groups~The growth in computer use since 1984 has not been uniform across demographic groups. Table IV shows that women, more highy educated workers, whites, white-collar workers, and full-time workers are more likely to use computers. The groups that experienced the greatest increases in computer use between 1984 and 1993 are also more likely to have experienced relative wage gains.
412~D1, D2~DV35~Derived Variable~Computer Wage Premium~Whether the computer wage premium represents a measure of the true returns to computer skills or largely reflects omitted characteristics of workers and their employers is currently the subject of debate.
412~D1, D2, D3, D5~F13~Findings~Computer Use at Work Across Industries~Computer use and its growth varies substantially across industries. It has become especially prevalent in such industries as legal services, dairy products, advertising, and public adminstration, while remaining unsurprisingly rare in logging, taxicab services, and bowling alleys. 
412~D1, D2~DV36~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education, Computer Utilization~To better understand the determinants of within-industry shifts toward more highly educated workers, researchers relate the change in the share of workers in each educational group across industries to industry-level measures of computer utilization. One interpretation of such a relationship is that the exogenous driving force is the rapid decline in the relative price of information technology. Industries vary in their ability to reoganize work to take advantage of computer technologies. In this case, cross-industry correlations of measures of computer use with changes in the relative employment of different skill groups may provide information about the extent of the relative complementarity or substitutability of these skill groups with computer technologies.

412~D1, D2, D3~F14~Findings~Shift Toward College-Educated Workers Across Industries~…the initial results of Table V indicate that the shift toward college-educated workers, and away from high school-educated workers, was greatest in industries that experienced the greatest rise in computer use.
412~D1, D2~DV36~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education, Computer Utilization~The association between the rise in the proportion of workers in an industry who use a computer and the share of highly educated workers may not represent a causal relationship. It is possible, for example, that an exogenous increase in th employment of college graduates causes the industry to adopt computers rather than vice versa.
412~D1~F15~Findings~Magnitude of the Coefficient of the Fraction of Workers Using a Computer~The magnitude of the coefficient on the fraction of workers using a computer, if it represents a causal effect of technology, implies that the growth of computers at work can account for a large share of the growth of college-educated employment. Between 1979 and 1993, college-educated worker's share of employment increased by 0.36 percentage points per year. The intercept of the bivariate regression in the first column of Table V, however, is just 0.03, which implies that at a constant level of computer use one would predict hardly any increase in the share of college-educated employment over this period. More rapid growth of computer use is also negatively related to the change in the share of those with exactly high school degrees in industry employment. These regression results are not driven by a few outlier industries.
412~D1, D2~DV37~Derived Variable~Change in Computer Use, Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education.~The contrasting relations of change in computer use from 1984 to 1993 with changes in the employment shares of college and high school graduates from 1979 to 1993 are illustrated in Figure I.
412~D1, D3, D5~F16~Findings~Faster Growth in Computer Use and Share of Less-than-High-School Workers in an Industry~…Table V indicates that faster growth in computer use is associated with a relative rise in the share of less-than-high school workers in an industry. This finding results in large part because industries that saw the greatest growth in computer use employed relatively few high school dropouts initially, and employment of high school dropouts fell substantially in almost all industries during this period. There is a limit to how much the share of high-school dropouts can fall in high-tech industries that initially employed very few high school dropouts. When the average years of education in an industry (measured in 1974 to avoid a mechanical correlation) is controlled in the right-hand part of Table V, the growth of computer use across industries has an insignificant effect on the employment share of less-than-high school workers, but continues to have a strong positive effect of employment of college graduates and a strong negative effect on employment of high school graduates.
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~F17~Findings~Robustness Check Results~Four robustness checks are worth reporting. First, similar results are obtained if each educational group's share of hours or of payroll is used as the dependent variable. Second, comparable results are found if the models in Table V are estimated for separate sample of men and women. Third, the growth in computer use is not perfectly aligned with the dependent variable in Table V because data on the fraction of workers who use a computer are not available prior to 1984. if the dependent variable is based on the 1984-1993 change in employment shares, however, the results are qualitatively similar.

412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~…to examine the results for another measure of employee skill, researchers have perforned an analogous analysis using industry-level data to relate the annualized change in the proportion of workers in each major occupational category between 1979 and 1993 to the annualized change in the fraction of workers in the industry who use a computer.
412~D1, D2~V12~Variable~Major Occupational Category~…major occupational categories are used to sort each worker in order to relate the annualized cahnge in the proportion of workers in each major occupational category between 1979 and 1993 to the annualized change in the fraction of workers in the industry who us a computer.

412~D1, D2, D3~F18~Findings~Occupation/Industry, Technological Change, and Wage-Related Growth~Consistent with the educational upgrading patterns, the occupational category results indicate that industries that experienced the greatest growth in computer use tended to shift their occupational mix toward managers and professionals, and away from administrative support/clerical and service workers. In general, occupations with higher average pay and higher education tended to expand more rapidly in sectors that adopted computer technology at a faster rate.
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~A concern with the regressions in Table V is that they may reflect past trends in skill upgrading, rather than a discrete break from preexisting trends. Furthermore, causality could be reversed - hiring more educated workers may lead an industry to subsequently adopt computer technology. To provide a partial check on these possibilities, researchers use Census and CPS data to look at the relationship between employment shifts in each decade since 1960 and recent changes in computer use.

412~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education~If the post-1979 shift toward more highly educated workers in industries that expended computer use reflects a continuation of earlier trends in skill upgrading, then researchers would expect to see a similar pattern of employment shifts in the 1960s, prior to the spread of PC's at work. Specifically consider the following variance components model for the change in the wage-bill share of college gradutes across industries: [Delta]WB(it) = [delta](t) + [Beta](i) + error(it) where [Delta]WB(it) represents the change in the wage-bill share of college graduates in industry i and period t (corresponding to the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s), [Beta](i) represents a time-invariant skill bias factor for industry i, [delta](t) is a time effect, and [error](it) is an error term.
412~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education~…[Delta]WB(it) represents the change in the wage-bill share of college graduates in industry (i) and period t (corresponding to the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s).

412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~OLS First-Difference~Since researchers lack direct information on employee computer usage prior to 1984, this hypothesis suggests estimating the follow simple regression model for different time periods: [Delta]WB(it) = [delta](t)' + [lambda](t)[Delta]C(i) + error(it)', where [Delta]C(i) is the change in the proportion of workers using a computer in industry i between 1984 and 1993 and [lambda](t) is a time varying parameter. If the results in Table V simply reflect stable preexisting trends, then the estimates of [lambda](t) ought to be similar for the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s. If recent increases in computer use reflect an acceleration of the skill-biased technological change, then the estimates of [lambda](t) should be higher for more recent decades.

412~D1, D2~F19~Findings~Computer Utilization and the Wage-Bill Share of College-Educated Workers~An industry's 1984-1993 increase in computer utilization has a somewhat weaker relationship with the change in the wage-bill share of college-educated workers in the 1960s than it does in the later decades. The coefficient on the computer adoption variable is modestly higher in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 1960s, but substantially greater in the 1990-1996 period. These findings suggest that the pace of skill upgrading an industries that more rapidly adopted computer technology in the 1984-1993 period increased relative to other industries after the 1960s. 
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5~M2~Methodology~OLS First-Difference~…the models estimated in Table VI are limited because they do not include data on indicators of industry computer intensity before 1984 or on other controls for overall capital intensity.

412~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~"NIPA capital stock data by asset category for detailed industries are based upon many imputations and are likely to be measured with substantial error. Industry investment in many specific asset categories (such as OCAM) is not directly measured (at least at high frequeny) by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, but is allocated across industries using capital flow tables and other ""indicators"" assumed to be correlated with industry commodity use (such as employment), and then further adjusted to match control totals from other reference sources. Despite these measurement problems, the NIPA data are the best available source of information on ""high-tech"" capital and overall capital intensity outside of the manufacturing sector."

412~D3~F20~Findings~Rate of Growth of the Aggregate Capital/Labor Ratio~The rate of growth of the aggregate capital/labor ratio declined from the 1960s to the 1970s and then declined further in the 1980s, but this phenomenon is much more pronounced in nonmanufacturing industries. While OCAM per worker is relatively stable from 1960 to 1970, it increases dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s.
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~Table VII presents a set of pooled cross-industry regressions covering 1960-1970, 1970-1980, and 1980-1990 of changes in the college graduate share of the wage bill on indicators of the rate of computer (OCAM) investment per worker and changes in overall capital intensity. Column (1) includes only time dummies for the 1970-1980 and 1980-1990 periods and illustrates an increase in the within-industry growth of the college wage-bill share in the 1970s and 1980s. Column (2) shows a positive contemporaneous relationship between decadal average computer investment per FTE and the change in the college payroll share. 
412~D1, D2, D3, D4~F21~Findings~Coefficients of Time Dummies~"An examination of the coefficients on the time dummies in columns (1) and (2) indicates that the increased rate of computer investment per worker can ""account for"" almost 40% of the increase in the rate of skill upgrading from the 1960s to the 1970s and overpredicts the further increase in the 1980s. But the use of a contemporaneous measure of skill upgrading and computer investment raises concerns about possible reverse causation with other factors driving skill upgrading and then leading industries to equip their college workers with office machinery."
412~D3~F22~Findings~Across-Industry Correlation of OCAM~The across-industry correlation (weighted by each industry's wage bill) of OCAM per FTE in 1980 and the proportion of workers using computers in 1984 is 0.74; the analogous correlation for OCAM per worker in 1990 and CPS computer utilization in 1989 is 0.77. The 1980-1990 change in OCAM per FTE has a (weighted) correlation of 0.47 with the cahnge in coputer usage from 1984 to 1993; and the log of average OCAM investment per FTE over the 1980s has a (weighted) correlation of 0.65 wiht the change in computer usage from 1984 to 1993.
412~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~Significant problems in measuring changes in the quality of new capital goods have led some to question the accuracy of the NIPA price deflators for new investment.

Specifically, researchers also include a lagged measure of computer investment per worker.
412~D1, D2, D6~F23~Findings~Lagged Computer Investment Column (3) Results~Column (3) of the lagged computer investment model indicates a positive and highly significant association of the log of an industry's OCAM investment per FTE in the five years prior to the start of each decade and that industry's growth of the college wage-bill share over the next ten years.
412~D1, D2, D6~F24~Findings~Lagged Computer Investment Columns (4-8) Results~The estimates on columns (4), (5), and (6) of Table VII indicate that the impact of computer investment on skill upgrading remains strong (using both contemporaneous and lagged computer investment measures) even when controls for changes in overall capital intensity and the growth in industry shipments are added to the specification. Columns (5), (7), and (8) present identical parsimonious specifications for all private industries, nonmanufacturing, and manufacturing. The impact on the growth of the college wage-bill share of computer investment per FTE is similar in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors, but changes in overall capital intensity are much more important in the skill-upgrading process in the manufacturing sector.
412~D1, D2, D6~F25~Findings~Lagged Computer Investment Robustness Checks Results~…researchers have performed multiple robustness checks of the lagged investment model findings. The results are almost identical when the total capital stock is replaced with the total stock of equipment, or if one uses measures of lages and changes in the OCAM capital stock per FTE rather than using measures of OCAM investment per FTE. The impacts of OCAM investments on skill upgrading are much stronger than those of other components of high-tech capital. If one allows the effect of the lagged log of computer investments per FTE to vary over time, the coefficient on computer investment is somewhat larger in the 1980s than in earlier decades. The findings are qualitatively quite similar when researchers use the college graduate share of employment as the dependent variables.
412~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~Possible systematic inaccuracies in the price deflators for computers and other capital investments could bias estimates of the timeeffects and suggest that caution is required in comparing the coefficients on the time dummies across the specifications in Table VII.

412~D4, D5~F27~Findings~R&D Expenditure and Skill upgrading~R&D intensity has a substantial positive impact on subsequent skill upgrading. The inclusion of R&D reduces the computer investment coefficient, but lagged computer investment per FTE continues to positively predict skill upgrading.
412~D5~D5~Dataset~NBER Productivity Database~Data for more disaggregated industries on the skill composition of the workforce and indicators of technological change, international competition, and outsourcing are available in the manufacturing sector than in the nonmanufacturing sector. Consequently, researchers use data on 450 four-digit industries from the NBER Productivity Database for the 1959 to 1989 period to reexamine these alternative hypotheses. Information on the educational attainment of the workforce is not available at the four-digit industry level, so researchers follow Berman, Bound, and Griliches [1994] in using the change in the nonproduction worker share of the wage bill as their measure of skill upgrading. 
412~D5~D5~Dataset~NBER Productivity Database~Researchers link data on the change in nonproduction worker wage-bill share, changes in capital intensity, real shipments growth, and total factor productivity growth from the NBER Productivity sample with information on computer investments as a share of total investments from the Census of Manufactures, import and export penetration measures from Feenstra [1996, 1997], and the (broad) foreign outsourcing measure used by Feenstra and Hanson [1996].

The annual percentage point change in the nonproduction worker share of the total manufacturing wage bill increased from .110 for 1959-1969 to .126 for 1969-1979, and then shot up to .375 for 1979-1989.
412~D6~F29~Findings~Growth of the Mean Computer Investment Share~"Column (2) of Table VIII includes the computer investment variable and indicates that the growth of the mean computer investment share from .026 in the 1970s to .057 in the 1980s can ""account"" for a rise of .09 percentage points annually (or 36% of the total increase) in the rate of within-industry skill upgrading from the 1970s to the 1980s in manufacturing."
412~D6~F30~Findings~Impact of Computer Investments and Overall Capital Intensity~Column (3) and (4) indicate that the impact of computer investments is little changed when measures of overall capital intensity and output growth are included or when the specification is expanded to include another proxy for technological change (TFP growth) and measures of the growth of imports, exports, and outsourcing.
412~D4, D5, D6, D7, D8~F31~Findings~Growth of the Log Capital Output Ratio and Growth in the Exports-to-Shipments Ratios~The overall growth of the log capital output ratio and growth in the exports-to-shipments ratios are both positively and significantly related to skill upgrading in the pooled model displayed in Table VIII Column (5). Outsourcing has a positive but not highly significant relationship to skill upgrading in specifications including the computer investment variable. The effect of computer investment on skill upgrading is quite similar when the specifications reported in columns (2) to (5) are expended to include four-digit industry effects.
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~Columns (6), (7), and (8) of Table VIII relax the constraint that the coefficients are the same across decades, and present separate regressions by decade analogous to the pooled specification in column (5).
412~D1, D3, D5, D6, D7, D8~F32~Findings~The Coefficient on Overall Capital Intensity~…in columns (6), (7), and (8) of Table VIII, computer investment remains a powerful explanatory variable in all three decades. The coefficient on overall capital intensivity increases over time, suggesting a possible secular rise in the magnitude of capital-skill complementarity in U.S. manufacturing from the 1960s to the 1980s.
412~D5~F33~Findings~Growth in the Computer Investment Ratio and Its Explanation of Skill Upgrading~"In summary, the estimates in Table VIII indicate that the growth in the computer investment ratio can ""explain"" approximately one-third of the increase in within-industry skill upgrading in U.S. manufacturing from the 1970s to the 1980s, under the rather strong assumption that the estimated effect of computer investment represents a causal impact of computer investment on skill demands. Changes in import penetration and outsourcing are not strong predictors of skill upgrading conditional on the computer investment ratio, but industries with expanding export shares appear to have faster growth in nonproduction worker payroll share."

412~D5, D6, D7, D8~DV54~Derived Variable~Change in Outsourcing~For 1959-1969 changes, [Delta]So is 100 times the minimum of one-tenth of the level of outsourcing in 1972 and the annual change in outsourcing from 1972-1979; for 1969-1979 it is 100 times the annual change in outsourcing from 1972-1979; and for 1979-1989 it is the 100 times the annual change in outsourcing from 1979-1990.
412~D5, D6, D7, D8~DV52~Derived Variable~CI/I~The weighted mean of CI/I is .026 in 1959-1969, .026 in 1969-1979, and .057 in 1979-1989.
412~D1, D2, D8~F34~Findings~The Effect of Outsourcing~Outsourcing has a strong positive and significant effect in pooled specifications only including the outsourcing mesaure and time dummies. Researchers find a similar pattern of results when researchers use the narrow outsourcing measure (imported intermediate inputs in the same two-digit industry as a buyer as a share of total nonenergy materials purchases).
412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~"Industry computer use frequencies were calculated from the October 1984, 1989, and 1993 School Enrollment Supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS) as the weighted fraction of currently employed workers ages 18-65 who answered yes to the question, ""Do you use a computer directly at work?"" within consistent Census Industry Code (CIC) industries (see below). A computer is defined as a desktop terminal or PC with keyboard and monitor and does not include an electronic change register or a hand-held data device. 62,000, 63,085, and 60,156 observations were used to calculate these frequencies in 1984, 1989, and 1993, respectively."

412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Researchers used the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files of the Current Population Survey for the years 1980, 1990, and 1996, and the February 1990 CPS, to calculate educational employment shares, educational full-time employment equivalent (FTE) shares, and educational wage-bill shares. Samples were limited to those currently employed in the same reference week including the self-employed and excluding those working without pay. Top-coded earnings observations were multiplied by 1.5. Log wage regressions used to calculate the college-plus/high school premiums reported in Tables I and II were limited to wage and salary workers. The bottom 1% of hourly earrners was dropped in each earnings regression. All CPS calculations were performed using the sampling weights for the outgoing rotation groups.

412~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education~Researchers used the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files of the Current Population Survey for the years 1980, 1990, and 1996, and the February 1990 CPS, to calculate educational employment shares, educational full-time employment equivalent (FTE) shares, and educational wage-bill shares.
412~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~FTE Shares~Researchers used the Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) files of the Current Population Survey for the years 1980, 1990, and 1996, and the February 1990 CPS, to calculate educational employment shares, educational full-time employment equivalent (FTE) shares, and educational wage-bill shares.
412~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~FTE Shares~Educational employment shares by industry were calculated as the fraction of employed in each of four educational categories. The share of FTEs supplied by each education group in an industry is the sum of usual weekly hours reported by education category divided by total hours reported. Because the self-employed do not report hours or earnings, researchers assigned them the average labor hours and earnings in their industry-education-year cell.
412~V1~L4~Variable Value~Less Than High School~…one of four educational categories of interest in the current research.
412~V1~L5~Variable Value~High School Graduates~…one of four educational categories of interest in the current research.
412~V1~L6~Variable Value~Some College~…one of four educational categories of interest in the current research.
412~V1~L7~Variable Value~College Plus~…one of four educational categories of interest in the current research.
412~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Usual Weekly Hours~In the rare cases where industry hours supplied by education category were unavailable (where all sampled workers in the cell were self-employed), researchers imputed weekly hours as 40 worker.
412~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education~Wage-bill shares are the sum of weekly earnings in an industry-education cell divided by total weekly earnings in the industry. In the case where earnings were not observed in an industry-education-year cell, researchers were not observed in an industry-education-year cell, researchers assigned the mean education-year wage.
412~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Hourly Earnings~In the case where earnings were not observed in an industry-education-year cell, researchers were not observed in an industry-education-year cell, researchers assigned the mean education-year wage.
412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~To overcome potential inconsistencies in the reporting of usual hours in the revised CPS, researchers assigned workers with fewer than 8 weekly hours the mean hourly wage for other part-time workers (those with 8-35 weekly hours) in their industry-education-year-cell when calculation wage-bill shares in 1990 and 1996.
412~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Usual Weekly Hours~To overcome potential inconsistencies in the reporting of usual hours in the revised CPS, researchers assigned workers with fewer than 8 weekly hours the mean hourly wage for other part-time workers (those with 8-35 weekly hours) in their industry-education-year-cell when calculation wage-bill shares in 1990 and 1996.
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~When estimating log earnings regressions for 1990 and 1996, researchers limited the sample to full-tme workers.

412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~In addition to the CPS samples noted, Table V uses the CPS MORG files from 1979 and 1993. The sample criteria are identical to those above except that self-employed workers were excluded. To calculate lagged industry levels, researchers used the 1974 May CPS file.
412~D2~D2~Dataset~Censuses of Population~To calculate educational shares of employment, FTE, and the wage bill, researchers used currently employed workers ages 18-65 from the Census PUMS for 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. Self-employed workers were retained, while those working without pay were excluded. Researchers calculated education shares, FTE shares, and wage-bill shares as they did in the CPS, with the exceptions that FTEs were not imputed to any observations since the self-employed report hours in the Census. Researchers calculated hourly wages as the ratio of wage and salary earnings in the previous year to the product of weeks worked in the previous year and hours worked in the survey reference week. Although usual hours in the previous year (as opposed to the reference week) are available in some Census samples, researchers used hours worked in the reference week for all wage calculates for consistency. In 1940 the Census questionnaire asked respondents to report full-time equivalent weeks worked instead of calendar weeks worked, and hence they calculated hourly earnings in 1940 as the ratio of annual income to reported weeks. in all years, wages were imputed to the currently self-employed and those with missing income as described above. Top coded income observations were multiplied by 1.5 in each year. Because, in 1990, Census income top-codes varied by state (but were always at or above 140,000), researchers assigned top coded observations the value of 210,000. Because both weeks-worked and hours-worked variables are intervalled in 1960 and 1970, researchers used the midpoint of each interval in lieu of the actual value. Sampling weights were used for all Census calculations in 1940 and 1990 samples.

412~D1, D2~DV8~Derived Variable~FTE Shares~To calculate educational shares of employment, FTE, and the wage bill, researchers used currently employed workers ages 18-65 from the Census PUMS for 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. Self-employed workers were retained, while those working without pay were excluded. Researchers calculated education shares, FTE shares, and wage-bill shares as they did in the CPS, with the exceptions that FTEs were not imputed to any observations since the self-employed report hours in the Census. 
412~D2~DV4~Derived Variable~Wage-bill Shares of Workers by Education~To calculate educational shares of employment, FTE, and the wage bill, researchers used currently employed workers ages 18-65 from the Census PUMS for 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. Self-employed workers were retained, while those working without pay were excluded.

412~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Hourly Earnings~Researchers calculated hourly wages as the ratio of wage and salary earnings in the previous year to the product of weeks worked in the previous year and hours worked in the survey reference week. Although usual hours in the previous year (as opposed to the reference week) are available in some Census samples, researchers used hours worked in the reference week for all wage calculations for consistency.
412~D1, D2~DV9~Derived Variable~Usual Weekly Hours~Researchers calculated hourly wages as the ratio of wage and salary earnings in the previous year to the product of weeks worked in the previous year and hours worked in the survey reference week. Although usual hours in the previous year (as opposed to the reference week) are available in some Census samples, researchers used hours worked in the reference week for all wage calculations for consistency.
412~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Total Hours Worked~Researchers calculated hourly wages as the ratio of wage and salary earnings in the previous year to the product of weeks worked in the previous year and hours worked in the survey reference week. Although usual hours in the previous year (as opposed to the reference week) are available in some Census samples, researchers used hours worked in the reference week for all wage calculations for consistency.
412~D1, D2~DV6~Derived Variable~Total Hours Worked~In 1940 the Census questionnaire asked respondents to report full-time equivalent weeks worked instead of calendar weeks worked, and hence they calculated hourly earnings in 1940 as the ratio of annual income to reported weeks. In all years, wages were imputed to the currently self-employed and those with missing income to reported weeks.
412~D1, D2~DV14~Derived Variable~Hourly Earnings~Top coded income observations were multiplied by 1.5 in each year. Because, in 1990, Census income top-codes varied by state (but were always at or above 140,000), reserachers assigned top-coded observations the value of 210,000.
412~D1, D2~DV15~Derived Variable~Weeks Worked, Hours Worked~Because both weeks-worked and hours-worked variables are intervalled in 1960 and 1970, researchers used the midpoint of each interval in lieu of the actual value.
412~D2~D2~Dataset~Censuses of Population~Prior to the 1990 Census and the 1992 CPS, the Census Bureau coded respondents' educational levl accorded to their highest grade completed. Starting in the 1990 Census and 1992 CPS, the questionnaire was changed to record the highest degree held or, when no degree is held, whether the highest grade attained falls within certain multiyear categories. This change creates substantial incompatibilities in comparing educational levels among CPS or Census samples across the coding regimes. Following the recommendations of Jaeger [1997], researchers use the following educational groupings. In data coded with the cold (years completed) education question (Census PUMS 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980, and CPS MORG files 1980 and 1990), researchers defined high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling; high school graduates as those having twelve years of completed schooling; some college attendees as those with any schooling beyond twelve years (completed or not) and less than sixteen completed years; and college plus graduates as those with sixteen or more years of completed schooling. In data coded with the new question, researchers define high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling; high school graduates as those with either twelve completed years of schooling or a high school diploma or G.E.D.; some college as those attending some college or holding an Associate's Degree (either occupational/vocational or academic); and college plus as those with a B.A. or higher.

In data coded with the new question, researchers define high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling; high school graduates as those with either twelve completed years of schooling or a high school diploma or G.E.D.; some college as those attending some college or holding an Associate's Degree (either occupational/vocational or academic); and college plus as those with a B.A. or higher.
412~D1, D2~V1~Variable~Educational Attainment~Prior to the 1990 Census and the 1992 CPS, the Census Bureau coded respondents' educational levl accorded to their highest grade completed. Starting in the 1990 Census and 1992 CPS, the questionnaire was changed to record the highest degree held or, when no degree is held, whether the highest grade attained falls within certain multiyear categories. This change creates substantial incompatibilities in comparing educational levels among CPS or Census samples across the coding regimes.

In data coded with the new question, researchers define high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling; high school graduates as those with either twelve completed years of schooling or a high school diploma or G.E.D.; some college as those attending some college or holding an Associate's Degree (either occupational/vocational or academic); and college plus as those with a B.A. or higher.
412~D2~D2~Dataset~Censuses of Population~The 1940 Census does not report whether years of schooling have been completed, and hence, for this sample, researchers include all those with twelve years of reported education as high school graduates.
412~D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9~M1~Methodology~Log Wages~In log earnings regressions where researchers distinguish college graduates from those with postcollege education, researchers define postcollege as seventeen plus completed years of schooling (years-based question) or any degree held beyond the B.A. (degree-based questions).
412~V1~L8~Variable Value~Postcollege~In log earnings regressions where researchers distinguish college graduates from those with postcollege education, researchers define postcollege as seventeen plus completed years of schooling (years-based question) or any degree held beyond the B.A. (degree-based questions).
412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~For CPS samples found in Tables IV and V, researchers used the conventional definitions of each education category.
412~V1~L4~Variable Value~Less Than High School~In data coded with the old education question, researchers defined high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling. In data coded with the new question, researchers define high school dropouts as those with fewer than twelve years of completed schooling.
412~V1~L5~Variable Value~High School Graduates~In data coded with the old education question, researchers defined high school graduates as those having twelve years of completed schooling. In data coded with the new question, researchers define high school graduates as those with either twelve completed years of schooling or a high school diploma or G.E.D.
412~V1~L6~Variable Value~Some College~In data coded with the old education question, researchers defined some college attendees as those with any schooling beyond twelve years (completed or not) and less than sixteen completed years. In data coded with the new question, researchers define some college as those attending some college or holding an Associate's Degree (either occupational/vocational or academic).
412~V1~L7~Variable Value~College Plus~In data coded with the old education question, researchers defined college plus graduates as those with sixteen or more years of completed schooling. In data coded with the new question, researchers defined college plus as those with a B.A. or higher.
412~D1, D2~DV7~Derived Variable~College+/High-School Wage Premium~For 1990-1996 changes in the college wage premium, researchers used the February 1990 CPS in conjuction with the 1996 MORG file since differences between the earnings concepts in the Census and CPS (annual versus weekly) makes direct Census-CPS comparisons of wages unreliable.
412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~For 1990-1996 changes in the college wage premium, researchers used the February 1990 CPS in conjuction with the 1996 MORG file since differences between the earnings concepts in the Census and CPS (annual versus weekly) makes direct Census-CPS comparisons of wages unreliable.
412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Two other difficulties result from using the February 1990 CPS. First, because the February 1990 survey contains both education questions, it is possible that responses to the degrees-completed question were skewed by the prior asking of the years-completed question. Second, since the February 1990 CPS contains only a single month's data, the sample is only one-third as large as the annual MORG file for industry employment and only one-twelfth as large for hours and earnings.
412~D1~D1~Dataset~Current Population Survey~In estimating the log earnings regressions for post-1992 CPS samples (degree-based education question), researchers use figures from Park [1994] to assign years of completed education to each worker based upon race, gender, and highest degree held.

412~D1, D2~DV12~Derived Variable~Experience~Years of potential experience were calculated as age minus assigned years of education minus six.
412~D3~V11~Variable~Industries~Although a majority of the Census Industries Codes (CICs) have remained intact since 1960 (aside from renumbering), many new industry categories have emerged from larger aggregates, while some detailed categories were collapsed or eliminated. During a major revision to the CIC in 1980, many industries were intertwined such that one or more old codes concorded with more than one new code. The current stategy for creating a consistent set of codes spanning the 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 CIC standard was to preserve industries that were present in all years, while recombining industries that were disaggregated in later years of that became intertwined during later revisions. Although in most cases it was unambiguous whether industries should be retained intact or merged, in the cases where there was minimal (but nonzero) overlap among industries, reserachers compromised in favor of preserving detail rather than enforcing perfect consistency. The resulting set of consistent industry codes contains 142 distinct industries for the 1960-1990 period, as compared with 149 industries in 1960, 213 in 1970, 231 in 1980, and 236 in 1990. Researchers also created consistent industry codes spanning the 1970 to 1990 period which are used in the models in Table V. Because the 1960 codes impose the greatest cost in lost detail, the 1970-1990 codes (which exclude 1960 CICs) contain 52 additional distinct industries (a total of 194). Many of the reported estimates were performed at several levels of CIC detail to test their sensitivity to aggregation. In general, aggregation has little effect on the estimated coefficients. Crosswalks between the 142 consistent CIC and the 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 CIC standard are available from the authors.

412~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~Researchers used data on capital stock (equipment, structures, and total) and investment in Office Computing and Machinery (OCAM) from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to measure capital intensity and high-tech capital holdings at the industry level between 1950-1990. As the denominator for the capital/FTE and equipment/FTE variables, researchers used NIPA data to calculate FTEs by industry in 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. To reduce measurement error, all variables in the NIPA (aside from FTEs and cumulative invetment measures) were constructed as five-year centered averages of the respective data category. All NIPA stock and investment variables are measured in real 1987 dollars. Deflation of NIPA measures is performed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis using primarily Producer Price Indexes (PPIs). PPIs for computer investment are based on quality adjustment price linking, and hedonic regression methods. See U.S. Department of Commerce [1993] for details.
412~D3~D3~Dataset~National Income and Product Accounts~To match CPS and Census data to the NIPA, researchers created a crosswalk between the NIPA categories (based on the SIC) and researchers' 142 consistent CIC categories. The resulting aggregation of NIPA and CIC data contains 47 consistent industries covering all industrial sectors excluding Government and Private Households, spanning the 1960-1990 CIC and the 1972 and 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). This crosswalk is available upon request.

412~D4~D4~Dataset~National Science Foundation~As a measure of industry R&D intensity, researchers used data from the National Science Foundation's [NSF] Research and Development in Industry series on company and other (except Federal) R&D funds as a percentage of net sales in R&D-performing manufacturing companies. To analyze these data in conjuction with the NIPA, researchers created an aggregate NIPA-NSF crosswalk that divides the manufacturing sector into fifteen consistent industries for the 1960-1995 period. This crosswalk is available upon request from the authors. Due to missing observations in the NSF data, several imputations and interpolations were required.

413~D1~F1~Findings~Minority Spending on Visible Goods~Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) from 1986 to 2002, researchers show that although, unconditionally, racial minorities and Whites spend approximately the same fraction of their expenditures on visible consumption, Blacks and Hispanics spend about 25% more on visible goods, after differences in permanent incomes are accounted for. These expenditure differences are found for all subgroups except older households. Researchers find that these racial gaps have been relatively constant over the past seventeen years, and that spending on housing or differential treatment in the housing market cannot explain these patterns. Finally, the gaps are economically larger: the absolute annual dollar differential for visible consumption is on the order of $1,900, which is a nontrivial quantity given Black and Hispanic average income. 
413~D1, D3, D4~V1~Variable ~Consumption Expenditures~Because of an intertemporal budget constraint, spending devoted to visible consumption must be diverted from some alternative use. 
413~D1, D2~F2~Findings~Minority Spending on Visible Goods, Future Goods, and Other Goods~Researchers show that the higher visible spending of racial minorities is drawn from both future consumption and all other categories of current consumption, with Blacks consuming less than Whites in essentially every other expenditure category (aside from housing) to maintain higher visible consumption. In fact, researchers do find that Blacks and Hispanics spend more on housing than do comparable Whites. The current results (in terms of dollar magnitudes) are slightly stronger if researchers include housing as a component of visible consumption.
413~V1~L3~Variable Value~Housing Consumption~Housing may be considered a visible good in some cases. However, given the large literature on racial differences in housing (which can explain housing expenditure differences), researchers err on the side of caution by excluding housing from their base measure of visible goods.
413~V1~L2~Variable Value~Visible Consumption~Although income (or wealth) is not observed, visible consumption is.
413~V1~L4~Variable Value~Conspicuous Consumption~The level of an individual's conspicuous consumption can be expected to depend on the income distribution from with his income is drawn - his reference group.
413~V1~L2~Variable Value~Visible Consumption~To the extent that visible consumption signals useful information about unobserved income, visible consumption should rise in own income, and, to the extent that being associated with a poorer reference group has negative informational consequences visible consumption should fall in the income of the reference group. Applying these insights, researchers argue that a status-signaling model will predict racial differences in visible consumption even if there are no racial differences in preferences. Because Whites and racial minorities belong to reference groups with different income distributions, persons with wimilar incomes will face different incentives to signal by consuming visibly. Importantly, if status signaling is indeed a determinant of visible consumption, the predictions about the negative relationship between visible exenditures and higher average reference group income should apply not only across races but also within any given race in communities with different average incomes.
413~D1, D2, D3, D4~V2~Variable~Race~Because Whites and racial minorities belong to reference groups with different income distributions, persons with similar incomes will face different incentives to signal by consuming visibly. Importantly, if status signaling is indeed a determinant of visible consumption, the predictions about the negative relationship between visible exenditures and higher average reference group income should apply not only across races but also within any given race in communities with different average incomes.
413~D1, D2, D4~V3~Variable~Family Income~Because Whites and racial minorities belong to reference groups with different income distributions, persons with similar incomes will face different incentives to signal by consuming visibly. Importantly, if status signaling is indeed a determinant of visible consumption, the predictions about the negative relationship between visible exenditures and higher average reference group income should apply not only across races but also within any given race in communities with different average incomes.

413~D1, D2, D3, D4~V2~Variable~Race~Researchers define an individual's reference group as persons of the individual's race living in his state.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The primary source of data for studying racial differences in consumption patterns comes from the 1986-2002 CEX, collected by the United States Department of Labor. The CEX is an ongoing rotating panel dataset, in which participating households are interviewed up to five times at three-month intervals. In any given calendar quarter, there are approximately 5,000 households in the survey, with some households entering the survey and others exiting. The initial interview collects household demographic information, which is updated during subsequent interviews to reflect any changes in household composition. Information on income during the previous twelve months is collected during the second and fifth interviews. Additionally, the second through fifth interviews each collect detailed household expenditure information for the three calendar months immediately preceding the interview.

413~D1, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Consumption Expenditures~All expenditures are averaged over all quarters that the household remained in the survey.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The sample includes all households where the head is between the ages of 18 and 49 (inclusive) and where the head reported his or her race as being White, Black, or Hispanic over all quarters in the sample. Researchers also restrict the data to households that did not change their state during their sample period and that have nonmissing values for the head's educational attainment, total household family size, and Census region where the household resides.

413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~Like previous users of CEX data, researchers aggregate to the consumption categories proposed by Harris and Sabelhaus (2000). Researchers use the CEX family-level extracts made available by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

413~D1, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Consumption Expenditures~Table A.1 lists the fifteen broad consumption categories used in the paper and their relationship to the 47 categories in the Sabelhaus and Harris files.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…the primary analysis sample consists of a total of 49,363 households, with heads of household between 18 and 49 years old. There are 37,289 White households, 6,766 Black households, and 5,308 Hispanic households.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…the primary analysis sample consists of a total of 49,363 households, with heads of household between 18 and 49 years old. There are 37,289 White households, 6,766 Black households, and 5,308 Hispanic households. In some specifications, researchers explore the robustness of the results by examining the consumption patterns of older households and the sensitivity of the results to excluding younger households.
413~D1, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Consumption Expenditures~To mitigate the effects of measurement error in the expenditure categories, the unit of analysis is the average quarterly expenditure in a consumption category over the period that the household is in the sample.
413~V1~L2~Variable Value~Visible Consumption~The focus in this paper is on visible consumption expenditures - items for which spending is readily observable and highly portable across a variety of interactions, including anonymous ones. 
413~V1~L2~Variable Value~Visible Consumption~Consistent with both common sense and the results of the unique survey, the current analysis treats visible consumption as expenditures on apparel (including accessories such as jewelry), personal care, and vehicles (excluding maintenance).
413~D3~D3~Dataset~Field Study~Also, researchers want to identify goods with the characteristics that individuals who consumer more of them are believed to be in better economic circumstances, on average, than individuals who consume less of such goods. Simple introspection suggests what these items are likely to be, but rather than simply asserting what those items are, researchers conducted an anonymous online survey of 320 students at the University of Chicago's Harris School and Graduate School of Business. After providing basic demographic information, respondents were asked how close their interaction with someone would have to be in order to ascertain whether that person's spending on various expenditure categories was above average. The details of this unique survey and a discussion of its results can be found in the Online Robustness Appendix to this paper posted on the QJE website.
413~V1~L3~Variable Value~Housing Consumption~Note that one especially important item of consumption is housing. The survey evidence suggests both that housing is reasonably observable and that it is perceived to have high income elasticity. The main concern is that racial differences in housing expenditures might derive from differential treatment in the housing market - a phenomenon that has been the focus of a large literature. Differential treatment in the housing market could, by itself, cause minorities to have very different housing expenditures than Whites, even absent conspicuous or exhibitionistic considerations. Given these concerns about differential treatment in the housing market, researchers adopt the conservative policy of excluding housing from the measure of total spending in most the main results. For the most part, researchers always treat housing separately, except for some robustness specifications in which researchers assess how the results are affected when housing expenditures are lumped in with overall visible spending.

413~D1~F3~Findings~Consumption Trends by Category~Overall, visible consumption expenditures compose roughly 12% of household total expenditures, whereas spending on food and shelter represent roughly 20% and 25%, respectively, of total expenditures. The table shows that some CEX households spend nothing on some expenditures categories over their time in the survey. Thus, whereas nearly all households spend on food, housing, entertainment services, and visible goods, 57% of households spend nothing on education, and around 20% spend nothing on alcohol and tobacco.
413~D1, D3, D4~V1~Variable~Consumption Expenditures~Standard consumption theory suggests that total household expenditures should be related to the household's permanent income: households with lower permanent incomes should consume less, all else equal. Likewise, differences in family size should also affect household consumption.
413~D1, D2, D4~V3~Variable~Family Income~Standard consumption theory suggests that total household expenditures should be related to the household's permanent income: households with lower permanent incomes should consume less, all else equal. Likewise, differences in family size should also affect household consumption.

413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~To explore racial differences in visible expenditures in the CEX sample, the regression one would want to estimate is log linear regression where Black(i) and Hispanic(i) are indicator variables denoting whether a household head is Black or Hispanic, respectively; Permanent Income is the household's permanent income; and X(i) is a vector of controls designed to measure differences in age, family structure, and other demographic variables across households. This vector consists of a quadratic in the age of the household head, household wealth controls, year effects, and indicator variables for the number of adults in the household, the total number of family members in the household, marital status, whether the household head is male, urban residence, MSA residence, and Census region. Equation (1).

413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~To estimate (1), one needs a good measure of household permanent income. Because the CEX's income measures are not of especially high quality - particularly among racial dimensions - they are unlikely to accurately reflect racial differences in household permanent income needed for estimation of (1).
413~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Permanent Income~To estimate (1), one needs a good measure of household permanent income. Because the CEX's income measures are not of especially high quality - particularly among racial dimensions - they are unlikely to accurately reflect racial differences in household permanent income needed for estimation of (1).
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The CEX asked households to report their various sources of income as they entered the survey. Many authors have shown that the CEX income data are of poor quality - something researchers find as well. As Table I shows, total family income, defined to include labor assets and transfer income, is missing for 27% of the sample. The CEX does not attempt to impute the missing income data. (SEE ALSO F5) Because the CEX's income measures are not of especially high quality - particularly among racial dimensions - they are unlikely to accurately reflect racial differences in household permanent income needed for estimation of (1).

413~D1, D2~F4~Findings~Income Differentials by Race~Table I also shows that for those reporting positive income, White households have 67% higher total income than Black households and 61% higher total income than Hispanic households. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for a similar time period to the Consumer Expenditure Survey and making similar sample restrictions, the comparable racial differences in total family income are 51% and 37%, respectively. Theory suggests a solution to the problem of poor quality CEX income data. Notice that the Permanent Income Hypothesis implies that expenditures is an especially good proxy for a household's permanent income. Fortunately, CEX expenditure data are of much higher quality than CEX income data. The racial differences in total expenditures from the CEX line up nearly exactly with the racial differences in total family income from the CPS. Specifically, Whites consume 50% more and 38% more than Blacks and Hispanics, respectively.
413~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Permanent Income~Theory suggests a solution to the problem of poor quality CEX income data. Notice that the Permanent Income Hypothesis implies that expenditures is an especially good proxy for a household's permanent income. However, proxying for permanent income with the log of total expenditures in (1) raises two problem. First, because expenditure components are jointly determined in models of lifecycle consumption, total expenditures are endogenous in an equation for any particular component of expenditures such as visible expenditures. Second there is the purely statistical concern that measurement error in the components of consumption will be related to measurement error in total expenditures.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…CEX expenditure data are of much higher quality than CEX income data.
413~D1, D2, D4~V10~Variable~Wealth Controls~For household wealth, researchers use the log of liquid assets if liquid assets are positive and a dummy for whether the household has positive liquid assets as controls liquid assets are defined as checking accounts, saving accounts, stock holdings, and bond holdings.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~…regressions calculate the estimated black-white gap in log visible expenditures with and without income, expenditure, and demographic controls. Regression controls include (in order of specification): (1) No additional controls; (2) Specification (1) plus income controls; (3) Specification (1) plus log total expenditure; (4) IV regression where log total expenditure is instrumented with income controls; (5) Specification (4) plus time dummies; (6) Specification (5) plus demographic and wealth controls.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Specification (2) includes the log of current household income, if income is positive, a cubic in the level of current household income, and a dummy for whether current household income is positive, as well as dummies for the education level (four categories), occupation (1-digit), and industry (1-digit) of the household head. Specification (3) reestimates specification (1) including the log of total household as an additional regressor. Specification (4) as an IV regression where log total expenditures is instrumented with the income controls (added in specification (2)). Specification (5) is the same as specification (4) but also includes year dummies. Specification (6) is the same as specification (5) but also includes a quadratic in the age of the household head, a dummy if the household head is male, a married dummy, Census region dummies, a dummy if the household lived in an MSA, an urban dummy wealth controls, and a series of separate dummies for the number of adults and children in the households.
413~D1, D2~V15~Variable~Occupation~...1-digit occupation dummies of the household.
413~D1, D2~V16~Variable~Industry~…1-digit industry dummies of the household.
413~D1~V17~Variable~Number of Children~…a series of dummies for the number of children in the household.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Given the problems in the CEX sample, researchers estimate a second regression and instrument for the log of total expenditures using the vector of current and permanent income controls, Income(i). Equation (2).
413~D1, D2, D4~DV2~Derived Variable~Income Controls~This vector consists of an indicator variable for whether current income is nonmissing, the log of current income if nonmissing, a cubic in the level of current income, three indicator variables for education and a series of one-digit industry and occupation codes.
413~D1~F5~Findings~Unconditional Means of Visible Expenditures and Minority Spending on Visible Goods~When researchers estimate (2) with only the race dummies and no other controls, Blacks and Hispanics are found to spend less on visible items than comparable Whites, by 38% and 24%, respectively (row(1)). These results simply reflect the unconditional means of visible expenditures, by race, reported in the first row of Appendix II.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~The regressions in rows (2)-(4) of Table II control for permanent income in various ways. The specification in row (2) simply adds the vector Income(i). As expected, the addition of these income controls (whose limitations as a measure of permanent income reseachers have already discussed) increases both the Black and White visible expenditure differences relative to the results shown in row (1). In row (3), researchers add the log of total expenditures rather than Income(i). Next, given the concerns outlined above about using total expenditures as a control in a regression for a specific component of expenditures, researchers instrument the log of total expenditures with the vector Income(i) in row (4). In rows (5) and (6) of the table researchers add a full set of time and demographic controls to the specification.
413~D1~F6~Findings~Log of Total Expenditures and Minority Spending on Visible Goods~Once the log of total expenditures rather than income is added to the regression, researchers find that Blacks and Hispanics consume 31% and 26% more visible goods than Whites with similar permanent income. 
413~D1, D2~F7~Findings~Permanent Income and Minority Spending on Visible Goods~…in specification (4), researchers find that Blacks and Hispanics spend 22% and 19% more, respectively, on visible goods than White households with similar permanent income.
413~D1, D2~F8~Findings~Time, Demographics, and Racial Differences in Visible Spending~Specification (5) and (6) show that the addition of time and demographic controls does not appreciably change the estimate racial differences in visible spending. In the preferred estimate, Blacks and Hispanics spend 26% and 23% more, respectively, on visible goods than do otherwise similar Whites.
413~D1, D3~F9~Findings~The Propensity to Purchase Visible Goods and the Luxury of Visible Goods~Although, to conserve space, researchers do not report point estimates for the nonrace coefficients, two results are worth noting. First, the propensity to purchase visible goods declines sharply with age for all races. Second, researchers find that visible goods are luxury goods. Specifically, the estimated coefficient on the log of total expenditures from the regression shown in row (6) of Table II is 1.5 (standard error = 0.03), implying that a 1% increase in total expenditures results in a 1.5% increase in visible expenditures. The luxury property of visible goods suggests why it is essential to control for permanent income when measuring racial differences in visible goods expenditures. It also explains why there is no unconditional racial differences in the share of spending devoted to visible goods: Blacks spend more than Whites on visible goods at every level of permanent income, but in unconditional comparisons this is obscured by the fact that Whites, with thier high incomes, consume more of these luxury goods.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~All of the results are robust to controlling for nonlinear measures of total expenditures.
413~D1~F10~Findings~Racial Differences in Visible Expenditures in Absolute Dollars~The racial difference in visible expenditures is large in absolute dollars. Appendix II shows that, on the average, Whites spend about $7,160 on visible items per year. The finding that Blacks and Hispanics spend 26% more than comparable Whites on visible goods therefore implies that Blacks and Hispanics spend, on average, roughly $1,9000 per year more on visible goods than their White counterparts. Because the CEX underreports total household consumption relative to data from the National Income and Product Accounts, this estimate is likely a lower bound. To put these magnitudes in persepctive, data from the March CPS show that, for the 1990-2002 period, Black and Hispanic households had average incomes, respectively, of $42,500 and $48,300 in 2005 dollars. Outlays on visible goods thus represent a substantial fraction of the overall budget of minorities.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…the CEX underreports total household consumption relative to data from the National Income and Product Accounts.
413~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Nonlinear Visible Expenditures Engel Curves~Figure I plots the estimated nonlinear visible expenditures Engel curves for Blacks and Whites separately. To generate the Engel curves, researchers regress log visible expenditures on log total expenditures and log total expenditures squared separately for Blacks and Whites. As above, researchers instrument log total expenditures and log total expenditures squared with the vector Income.
413~D1, D2, D5~M2~Methodology~Log-Log~Figure I plots the estimated nonlinear visible expenditures Engel curves for Blacks and Whites separately. To generate the Engel curves, researchers regress log visible expenditures on log total expenditures and log total expenditures squared separately for Blacks and Whites. As above, researchers instrument log total expenditures and log total expenditures squared with the vector Income.
413~D1, D2, D3~F11~Findings~Engel Curves, Price Discrimination and the Luxury of Visible Goods~Figure I shows that for both Blacks and Whites, on average visible expenditures are luxury goods. Also, at every level of log total expenditures, Blacks spend more on visible goods then their White counterparts. Notice further that the two Engel curves are parallel over most of the total expenditures range, mitigating concerns that the main results derive in some way from a fundamental difference in the shapes of these relationships across races. General discrimination cannot explain the results in Table II, which control for total expenditures directly. As a result, the correct interpretation of the results should lead to the question of why Blacks and Hispanics allocate a greater share of their expenditures to visible goods. There is no evidence that, relative to other goods, Blacks and Hispanic pay higher prices for clothing, jewelry, and personal care items than similar Whites. This finding that racial minorities exhibit a greater propensity to consume visible goods is robust to a variety of alternative specifications and restrictions, including restricting the sample to households with positive current income, excluding household with less than $23,200 a year in total expenditures (the twenty-fifth percentile of the expenditure distribution), excluding households under the age of 24, varying the specific components of the instrument set Income(i), including log expenditures on housing as an additional control, and restricting the sample to include only those who completed all four CEX surveys.
413~D1~DV3~Derived Variable~Nonlinear Visible Expenditures Engel Curves~…shows separate Engel curve estimates of log visible expenditures on a quadratic expression in log total expenditures for Blacks and Whites using data from the CEX. Log total expenditures and log total expenditures squared are instrumented using the same vector Income described int he notes to Table II. The regresssions are estimated over a similar range populated by both Black and White households: households with quarterly total expenditure greater than $1,300 and less than $26,200 (in 2005 dollars). These total expenditures cutoffs are approximately the first percentile of the White quarterly total expenditure distribution and the ninety-ninth percentile of the Black quarterly total expenditure distribution, respectively.
413~D1, D2, D5~M2~Methodology~Log-Log~…shows separate Engel curve estimates of log visible expenditures on a quadratic expression in log total expenditures for Blacks and Whites using data from the CEX. Log total expenditures and log total expenditures squared are instrumented using the same vector Income described int he notes to Table II. The regresssions are estimated over a similar range populated by both Black and White households: households with quarterly total expenditure greater than $1,300 and less than $26,200 (in 2005 dollars). These total expenditures cutoffs are approximately the first percentile of the White quarterly total expenditure distribution and the ninety-ninth percentile of the Black quarterly total expenditure distribution, respectively.
413~D1, D2~F12~Findings~Racial Differences in Visible Spending Across Subgroups~…racial differences in visible spending are found in all subgroups in the current sample. For example, single Black men, single Black women, and married Black households consume 32% more, 28% more, and 22% more than their respective White counterparts. The racial differences in visible spending are statistically larger among single men than is the substantial gap among married households. Similar patterns are found among Hispanics. Researchers find racial differences in visible spending within all education groups, and the gap for those with only a high school education (-0.30) is not statistically different from the gaps for those with at least a college degree (-0.23). the racial visible spending difference does diminish sharply with age. Among households aged 18-34 the Black-White conditional gap in visible spending is 30%, which declines to 23% for households aged 35-49, and declines further to only 15% for households aged 50-69.
413~D1~DV4~Derived Variable~Racial Differences for Visible Consumption~Table III presents estimated racial differences for the separate components of visible consumption, namely, vehicles, clothing, and personal care, in the CEX. Panel A presents results for the full sample, whereas Panel B presents results for the sample fo households that own vehicles.
413~D1, D3~F14~Findings~Racial Differences in Visible Spending by Category~…in both Panel A and B of Table III, Blacks and Hispanics spend significantly more both on personal care and on clothing and jewelry than comparable Whites. For vehicle spending the results are more nuanced. In the overall sample, both Blacks and Hispanics spend less on cares than do Whites. Among vehicle owners, however, Blacks in the CEX spend around 12% more on vehicles than comparable Whites. The fact that Blacks and Hispanics, all else equal, are less likely to own vehicles explains why the racial difference in vehicle spending is not found for the full sample. The lower vehicle ownership among Blacks and Hispanics is likely the result of two factors: the fact that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to live in city centers and, as a result, have lower vehicle needs, and the fact that liquidity constraints may prevent Blacks and Hispanics from making a sufficient down payment to purchase a vehicle.
413~D1, D2, D4~DV5~Derived Variable~Budget Constraint~The intertemporal budget constraint implies that the observed higher spending on conspicuous goods must come from another component of current consumption and/or from future consumption (i.e., current savings).
413~D1~DV6~Derived Variable~Conditional Differences for Other Consumption Categories~Table IV looks at the conditional differences in spending on other consumption categories. Along with visible consumption, these consumption categories compose the universe of consumption expenditures in the CEX and are described in Table A.1. The coefficients in Table IV come from a regression identical to that reported in row (6) of Table II, except that the dependent variable is not the log of the category and Tobit models are estimated for categories with a high incidence of zero expenditure.
413~D1, D2~M3~Methodology~Tobit~Table IV looks at the conditional differences in spending on other consumption categories. Along with visible consumption, these consumption categories compose the universe of consumption expenditures in the CEX and are described in Table A.1. The coefficients in Table IV come from a regression identical to that reported in row (6) of Table II, except that the dependent variable is not the log of the category and Tobit models are estimated for categories with a high incidence of zero expenditure.
413~D1~F15~Findings~Racial Differences in Percentage of Spending on Consumption~The first striking fact from Table IV is that there is no evidence that Blacks and Hispanics allocate a higher percentage of their spending than Whites to any consumption category other than visible goods and housing. In fact, aside from utilities, Blacks spend less than similar Whites on all other consumption categories. Some of the differences are small, such as the very small differences between Blacks and Whites in food expenditures. However, Blacks spend 16% less on education, approximately 29% less on entertainment, and 50% less on health. Similar patterns emerge for Hispanics.
413~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~To confirm the patterns depicted throughout the first section of this paper for racial consumption differences, researchers also estimate a variety of models using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). This exercise is important partly to establish whether the main results are found in another nationally representative data source with information on consumption.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~…although the CEX is the primary source of data on consumption expenditures in the United States, and thus serves as the main data source, it is not desinged to measure household income.
413~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~…the PSID provides excellent measures of household income over multiple years, so it is possible to control carefully permanent income in the regressions. The limitation of th PSID is that, until recently, it only contained limited measures of household consumption. Starting in 2005, the survey added an expanded set of expenditure questions, including some questions about the visible items studied. Currently, these measures are available only for the 2005 wave.
413~D4~T2~Time Period~2005.0~Using data from the 2005 PSID, researchers can examine racial differences in consumption patterns for this limited set of categories using a different measure of permanent income.
413~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~Using data from the 2005 PSID, researchers can examine racial differences in consumption patterns for this limited set of categories using a different measure of permanent income. These estimates can then be compared with those from the CEX, where permanent income is proxied by total expenditures. Researchers restrict the 2005 wave of the PSID to meet the same age and other restrictions used for the CEX sample. 
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Using data from the 2005 PSID, researchers can examine racial differences in consumption patterns for this limited set of categories using a different measure of permanent income. These estimates can then be compared with those from the CEX, where permanent income is proxied by total expenditures. Researchers restrict the 2005 wave of the PSID to meet the same age and other restrictions used for the CEX sample. Researchers estimate versions of (1) using the log of clothing expenditures as the dependent variable. The proxy for the household's permanent income is the average of total annual family income between 1999 and 20045 for the years that the household was in the sample.
413~D4~DV7~Derived Variable~Racial Differences in Clothing Expenditures~Using data from the 2005 PSID, researchers can examine racial differences in consumption patterns for this limited set of categories using a different measure of permanent income. These estimates can then be compared with those from the CEX, where permanent income is proxied by total expenditures. Researchers restrict the 2005 wave of the PSID to meet the same age and other restrictions used for the CEX sample. Researchers estimate versions of (1) using the log of clothing expenditures as the dependent variable. The proxy for the household's permanent income is the average of total annual family income between 1999 and 20045 for the years that the household was in the sample.
413~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~Full sample selection and other details about the PSID sample are provided in the Online Robustness Appendix. Researchers also discuss additional visible expenditures results from the PSID data beyond the estimates of cross-race differences given here and present results about the distribution of retail establishment by the racial makeup of the ZIP code, with data from teh county business patterns. This evidence is only suggestive, but it does show a higher incidence of business devoted to selling visible items such as clothing in ZIP codes with greater numbers of racial minorities.
413~D4~D4~Dataset~Panel Study of Income Dynamics~The sample includes all houeholds in the 2005 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics where the head is between the ages of 25 and 49 (inclusive) and is either Black or White. Sample sizes differ across the specifications given that researchers restricted each specification to only includes households with positive spending on the given category. Nearly all the sample conducted some spending on food expenditures and clothing, and nearly all consumed some form of entertainment and other transportation. The purchasing of a vehicle during the prior three years was limited to roughly 50% of the sample. All data are weighted using the PSID core family weights. Robust standard errors (clustered at the state level) are in parentheses.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~The sample includes all houeholds in the 2005 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics where the head is between the ages of 25 and 49 (inclusive) and is either Black or White. Table 5 displays the coefficient on the Black dummy of a regression of log spending for different consumption categories on a race dummy only (specification in row (1)) and a race dummy, the log of household permanent income, a cubic in the age of the household head, a dummy for the sex of the household head, a marital status dummy, and a vector of family size, number of children, and region dummies (specifications in rows (2)-(6)). The sample sizes differ across specifications given that researchers restricted each specification to only include households with positive spending on the given category. Nearly all the sample conducted some spending on food expenditures and clothing, and nearly all consumed some form of entertainment and other transportation.
413~D1, D2, D4~V4~Variable~Age~…a cubic in the age of the household head is included in log-linear regressions.
413~D1, D2, D4~DV8~Derived Variable~Permanent Income~For the PSID measure of permanent income, researchers average total household annual family income between 1999 and 2005 for the years that the household was in the sample. 
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Table V presents the results for the measures available in the PSID. Row (1) presents the estimated racial difference in clothing expenditures when no controls are added to regression (1). The specification in row (2) controls for permanent income and for the full set of demographic controls used in earlier regressions. Row (3) presents results for the price of new car purchases - the only other visible spending researchers can sharply identify in the 2005 PSID data. Row (4) concerns food, row (5) concerns entertainment, and row (6) concerns other transportation.
413~D4~F16~Findings~PSID Regression Results~PSID regression results are as follows: As in the Cex, lower overall income among Blacks means that they tend to spend less on clothing than do Whites, on average. The results for clothing are similar to the preferred CEX estimates: Blacks in the PSID spend 24% more on clothing than do comparable Whites. The row (3) estimate suggests that Blacks bought cars that were 12% more expensive than those similar Whites bought. Perhpas because of the small sample size, the effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels, but it is reassuringly similar to the corresponding estimate fromt he CEX data. Similarly reassuring are the other PSID estimates in the table, which indicate that, as in th CEX, Blacks in the PSID spend less than similar Whites on food (row (4)), entertainment (row (5)), and other transportion (row (6)). The fact that the PSID estimates, which control directly for permanent income using high quality panel data on income, correspond well with the authors' preferred CEX estimates suggest that the approach of using total expenditures as a proxy for permanent income and then instrumenting it using available income measures captures variation in permanent income quite well.
413~D4~F17~Findings~Racial Differences in Visible Spending in the PSID~In summary, researchers find that Blacks and Hispanics spend roughly 30% more on visible expenditures (cars, clothing, jewelry, and personal care items) than do otherwise similar Whites. These patterns are similar across all subgroups of the population (with the notable exception that the differential racial propensity to consume visibly declines sharply with age), across the two nationally represntative surveys in which this can be studies, and with different methods of controlling for household permanent income. Strikingly, while minority households consume more visible goods than comparable Whites, they consume less than or the same amount as Whites of all other consumption categories aside from housing.
413~D1, D4~DV9~Derived Variable~Kernel Densities of Total Annual Expenditures~Figure II shows the kernel density of total annual expenditures from the CEX and average family income from the PSID separately for Blacks and Whites. The sample used for the kernel estimation are the same samples as described in the notes to Table I (for the CEX) and Table V (for the PSID). Likewise, the measures of total expenditures and total family income are also described in Section III.
413~D1, D2, D4~DV12~Derived Variable~Utility~Consider an economy in which individuals belonging to group k have incomes [gamma](i)^k drawn from a known distribution with density f(k)([gamma]) and support on the interval [[gamma](min)^k, [gamma](max)^k]. Income is not publicly observed, and is used to finance consumption of two goods: c, which is observed by outsiders, and (y-c), which is not. Each agent has the same utility (SEE Equation (3) IN TEXT) where u, v, and w are each concave and twice continuously differentiable. In (3), status reflects society's inference about i's income based on things observed about (i). IT follows that status is equal to the expected value of income dependent on the equilibrium visible consumption and an individual's group. In the separating equilibium of this model, each agent chooses consumption to maximize (3) subject to his budget set, and society's beliefs about income are correct for each individual.
413~D1, D2, D3, D4~DV10~Derived Variable~Status~…status reflects society's inference about (i)'s equilibrium visible consumption, and k is his group.
413~D1, D2, D3, D5~DV10~Derived Variable~Status~In the separating equilibrium of this model, each agent chooses consumption to maximize (3) subject to his budget set, and society's beliefs about income are correct for each indviidual. 
413~D1, D4~DV11~Derived Variable~Equilibrium Spending on Conspicuous Goods~…the equilibrium spending on conspicuous goods is strictly increasing in [gamma](i). The relationship is concave if utility from status is sufficiently more concave if utility from status is sufficiently more concave than that for the other components of utility. Otherwise, visible spending rises with income in a convex fashion. Importantly, because the income of the poorest person in a group is correctly assessed, in equilibrium this person has no incentive to engage in greater consumption of the visible good than if there wer no signaling motive whatsoever.
413~D1, D2, D4~F18~Findings~Income Distribution and Average Conspicuous Spending~…as the dispersion of a group's income distribution increases, the effect on average conspicuous spending in the group is theoretically ambiguous. The intuition for the ambiguous result is as follows. Suppose that there is a redistribution in which income is transferred from A to a richer person B and group income dispersion increases. Because equilibrium consumption is strictly increasing in [gamma](i), conspicuous spending will decrease for A and increase for B. However, because the relationship between equilibrium consumption and [gamma](i) may be either concave or convex, the relative magnitude (absolute value) of the decrease in visible spending for A and the increase in visible spending for B is ambiguous.
413~D1, D2, D4~F19~Findings~Poverty, Income Distribution and Average Conspicuous Spending~…if poorer persons are added to a group, so that the support of the group's income distribution becomes [[gamma](min)-[theta], [gamma](max)] with [theta] > 0, and average group income falls, then conspicuous spending rises at every level of income. The intuition is that as poorer people are added to a population, persons of every level of income must now signal more to distinguish themselves from those immediately poorer, because those people are themselves now compelled to spend more to distinguish themselves from persons who are even poorer still.
413~D1, D4~V18~Variable~Reference Group~…k denotes the reference groups.
413~D1, D4~V18~Variable~Reference Group~…the reference groups k represent, in theory, any type of grouping into which a population can be sorted. Depending on the situation, observers will know more or less about the distribution from which other individual's unobserved income is drawn. In other words, the particular reference group k that is used to draw inferences about individual income will vary from one context to another. The key prediction is that information about one's reference group influences observers' inferences about one's income, and thus interacts with the optimal choice of signaling expenditures.
413~D1, D2, D4~F20~Findings~The Permanent Income of Blacks vs. Whites~The patterns in Figure II showing that Blacks have a much lower permanent income, on average, than Whites suggest that the higher relative visible spending of Blacks is consistent with the main prediction of a status model if race is the only exogenous observable characteristic that helps one infer an individual's socioeconomic position. But, even in a random anonymous situation, an observer of a Black (White) person will typically know more about the person's income than that if it is drawn from the national income distribution of Blacks (Whites). At a minimum, the observer knows that the person's income is likely drawn from the Black (White) income distribution in the state where the person resides. 
413~D1, D4~V18~Variable~Reference Group~If k is taken to represent different race/state cells, several interesting testable predictions follow from the status-signaling model.
413~D1, D4~V18~Variable~Reference Group~Researchers define reference groups with respect to state because the state is the lowest level of spatial aggregation available in the CEX data.
413~D1, D2, D5~M2~Methodology~Log-Log~Before conducting separate within-race analysises of conspicuous spending behavior, researchers explore whether there is evidence to support the idea that persons at a given level of income, and belonging to a particular race/state cell, spend more on visible goods than similar persons belonging to race/state cells with higher average income. Using the same CEX sample as in previous sections, researchers estimate a log-log regression of the total visible spending of an individual i of race r living in state s where [Gamma](s) and [Gamma](r) are vectors of state and race effects, respectively; and where, as in previous regressions, log total expenditures proxies for permanent income and is instrumented for with the vector Income (described above).
413~D1, D2, D5~M2~Methodology~Log-Log~Figure III plots the estimated effects against the mean level of income for the particular race/state cell as estimated in the CPS.  
413~D2~D2~Dataset~Current Population Survey~Researchers use data from the 1990 through the 2002 March CPSs to compute the mean labor income of White males by state. To be consistent with the CEX sample, researchers restrict the CPS sample to include only individuals between the ages of 18 and 49 (inclusive).
413~D1, D2~F21~Findings~Mean Income of a Race/State Cell and Average Spending on Visible Goods~…there is a negative and strongly statistically significant relationship between the mean income of a race/state cell and average spending on visible items among persons in that cell, relative to similar persons belonging to other race/state groupings. This result, estimated across all race/state cells, is consistent with the prediction of the status-seeking model.
413~D1, D2~F22~Findings~Race/State Cells and Income~Black race/state cells have lower permanent incomes and higher visible spending, White race/state cells have substantially higher permanent incomes and lower visible spending and Hispanic race/state cells are, on average, between those for Blacks and Whites on both dimensions.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~What is the evidence about visible spending for people of the same race? To answer this question researchers estimate separately for each race the log linear regresssion where k is a race/state cell for the particular race, and [mu](k)^[gamma] and D(k)^[gamma] are, respectively, the (log of) the mean and dispersion of income for persons in the race/state cell. As before, researchers instrument for Expenditure using the vecotr Income. Henceforth, researchers measure the dispersion of income in a race/state by the coefficient of variation - dimensionless measure of dispersion. Equation (5).
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Table VI presents results for Whites in the CEX for Equation (5). Column (1) shows the base estimates. The specification in the second column adds the coefficient of variation.
413~D1, D2~DV13~Derived Variable~Dispersion of Income~Henceforth (including (5) and after), researchers measure the dispersion of income in a race/state by the coefficient of variation - a dimensionless measure of dispersion.
413~D1, D2~F23~Findings~Mean State Income and Visible Expenditure Share~Column (1) of Table VI shows that the base estimate of the coefficient of interest is a strongly statistically significant -0.60. This implies that doubling the mean state income of Whites reduces the visible expenditures of Whites by 60%, all else equal. In the second specification, researchers continue to find that higher average income of Whites in a White household's state is associated with lower visible spending, all else equal. Indeed, the point estimate on mean reference group income is larger than the specification in column (1). These basic results for average reference group income in columns (1) and (2) are strongly consistent with the main prediction of the status-signaling model. Higher dispersion in reference group income is shown to lower White visible spending, with an effect that is strongly statistically significant, in column (2). As discussed above, the theory is ambiguous about the sign of the effect of reference group income dispersion on visible spending. 
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~A potential concern about the results in the first two columns is that there may be some factor correlated with average state income that mechanically causes reduced spending on visible goods. Differences across states in housing prices represent one such factor. Consider a state where the price of housing is high, all else equal. Individuals with a given level of income in that state will spend more for the same amount of housing, and less on other consumption items, perhaps including visible items. to account for this, researchers control directly for the individual's log housing expenditures in their estimation of (5). Given the endogeneity of individuals' expenditures on housing with respect to thier total and visible expenditure decisions, researchers instrument individual housing expenditures with the mean value of house prices in the household's state of residence.
413~D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Mean Value of House Prices~Given the endogeneity of individual's expenditures on housing with respect to their total and visible expenditure decisions, researchers instrument individual housing expenditures with the mean value of house prices in the household's state of residence.
413~D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Mean Value of House Prices~Researchers compute the mean value of house prices using data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses. For households in the CEX from 1986 to 1994, researchers use the 1990 Census average state house price; for CEX households from 1995 to 2002, researchers use the 2000 Census average state house price.
413~D5~D5~Dataset~Census~Researchers compute the mean value of house prices using data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses. For households in the CEX from 1986 to 1994, researchers use the 1990 Census average state house price; for CEX households from 1995 to 2002, researchers use the 2000 Census average state house price.
413~D1~T3~Time Period~1986-1994~For households in the CEX from 1986 to 1994, researchers use the 1990 Census average state house price.
413~D5~T5~Time Period~1990.0~For households in the CEX from 1986 to 1994, researchers use the 1990 Census average state house price.
413~D1~T6~Time Period~1995-2002~…for CEX households from 1995 to 2002, researchers use the 2000 Census average state house price.
413~D5~T7~Time Period~2000.0~…for CEX households from 1995 to 2002, researchers use the 2000 Census average state house price.
413~D1, D2, D5~F24~Findings~Individual Housing Expenditures and the Mean and Dispersion of Reference Group Income~Researchers find that controlling for individual housing expenditures slightly reduces the estimated effects of both the mean and dispersion of reference group income on Whites' visible spending. Both effects, however, remain significant after controlling for housing expenses.
413~D1, D5~F25~Findings~First-Stage Relationship Between Housing Expenditures and State Housing Prices~The first-stage relationship between housing expenditures and state housing prices is very strong, with F-states on the excluded instruments well in excess of 50.
413~D5~DV14~Derived Variable~Mean Value of House Prices~The ordinal relationship across states in average housing prices is so strong that it does not matter if instead researchers use only the 1990 house price or only the 2000 price.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~The housing price specifications in column (4) and (5) are identical to those in column (3), except that the outcome variables are, in turn, the log of food expenditures and the log of all expenditures minus reported visible and housing expenditures.
413~D1, D2, D4, D5~M1~Methodology~Log-Linear~Table VII presents within-race estimates for a pooled sample of Blacks and Hispanics. Researchers pool together Blacks and Hispanics to increase the sample size for the estimation. However, aside from larger standard errors, the point estimates in the pooled regression are similar to the point estimates researchers get if they restrict the sample to include only Blacks or only Hispanics. In the second column researchers add the dispersion of reference group income to the regression. In column (3), researchers control for the log of individual housing expenditures - instrumented with mean state housing prices. In column (4) of Table VII, researchers include the mean income of all men in the state as an additional regressor. The final two columns repeat the exercise conducted earlier for Whites: researchers estimate the same regresssion as in column (3), but now with food expenditures and all nonvisible plus housing spending as the outcomes.
413~D1, D2, D5~F26~Findings~Pooled Sample Estimation Results~The results of within-race estimates for a pooled sample of Blacks and Hispanics indicate that among racial minorities, visible spending is lower the higher the mean income of racial minorities, visible spending is lower the higher the mean income of racial minorirties in the state. The point estimate indicates that a doubling of the average of minority incomes lowers minority visible spending by 44%, all else equal. When controlling for the log of individual housing expenditures in column (3) researcehrs find that the estimated effect of both the mean and dispersion of reference group income remains essentially unchanged. In column (4), researchers continue to find that Blacks and Hispanics have lower visible expenditures when the mean income of their race-based reference group is higher. However, if the mean income of all men in the state increases, holding the mean income of men from the person's own race constant, visible expenditures increase. For the final two columns, the very small point estimates for total nonvisible spending indicate that the qualitative impact of higher mean reference group incomes of expenditures is zero.
413~D1, D2, D5~M2~Methodology~Log-Log~Using the same methods as previously described, researchers reestimate equation (2) - with which had earlier documented the differences in visible spending across races - but now add to that regression, for each individual, the mean and coefficient of variation of income in the household's race/state cell. This regression assesses whether Blacks or Hispanics, with thier own income and the mean income of the racial peer group held constant have the same visible expenditures as Whites, all else equal. The regression in column (2) continues to exclude reference group income but now adds state fixed effects. In the third column researchers add, for each individual, the average income of his or her race/state reference group and exclude the state fixed effects. Column (4) adds state fixed effects to the regression in the third column, and the fifth column adds both state fixed effects and the coefficient of variation of reference group income.
413~D1, D2~F27~Findings~Consumption Gap, Race/State Income, and the Incomes of Racial Reference Groups  ~Without reference group income controls, observationally equivalent Black and Hispanic male-headed households consume 26% and 23% more on visible goods, respectively, than do Whites. In column (2), the estimated effects of 0.28 and 0.25 show that the state fixed effects have no influence on the estimated racial gaps in visible expenditures. The third specification shows dramatically that the control for reference group income explains nearly the entire gap in spending across races. Both the Black and Hispanic point estiamtes are quantitatively tiny and statistically indistinguishable from zero. The results in specification 4 and 5 are qualitatively the same as the results in column (3). In summary, the results show that the visible expenditure differences between Blacks and Hispanics versus Whites vanish once one controls for the average income of the race/state cells from which individuals' incomes are drawn. Importantly, the results also indicate that it is not some generic trait of the state that explains the conspicuous consumption gap, but rather the incomes of individuals' racial reference groups specifically.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~For the primary analysis in this researcher, the extracts of the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), compiled by Harris and Sabelhaus (2000) and available online through the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) are used.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The NBER CEX files are available from 1980Q1 to 2003Q1, and researchers use data from 1986 to 2002. The year 1986 is the first year that the CEX data included unique family identifiers, which researchers need to merge key additional information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) raw CEX data files.

413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The NBER CEX extracts were intended to provide a condensed version of original data that was consistent over time. The extracts include information from the CEX family files, the member files, the detailed expenditure files, and the detailed income files. The extracts aggregate spending over 500 detailed items in the raw data into 47 spending categories. The current analysis further aggregates spending into 15 categories. The 15 categories researchers used in this paper compose the universe of all expenditure categories in the NBER CEX files. Researchers restrict the NBER-CEX data to include only household heads (ensuring that there is only one observation per household in the data). After deletions, the sample includes 49,363 households, comprising 37,289 White households, 6,766 Black households, and 5,308 Hispanic households.

413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The NBER CEX files do not include state of residence, Hispanic origin, city size, number of adults in the household, or number of quarters that the household participated in the survey. Researchers download these key variables from the CEX raw files and merged them with the analysis sample manually.
413~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Housing Service Flows~As is standard in the literature, researchers compute a measure of housing service flows. For renters, this is the rent for their home/apartment; for homeowners, it is the homeowner's report of the rental equivalence of the home. In the analysis, researchers experiment with other measures of housing flow services, such as setting them to 6% of the homeowner's housing value. The results are unaffected.
413~D1~DV15~Derived Variable~Housing Service Flows~The current measure of housing services spending includes spending on the rental of household furniture and spending on home maintenance (such as paint and roof repair and replacement), home remodeling (adding an addition), and home decoration (wall-to-wall carpeting, replacement of hardwood floors). The inclusion of these categories is an artifact of the NBER CEX files. The measure of rent paid for tenant-occupied dwellings in the NBER CEX files combines a broad set of housing expenditures aside from rent paid and as a results, it is impossible to disaggregate the data at a finer level.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~The NBER CEX files report the sum of spending in a variety of categories across all quarters that the household participated in the survey. Households surveyed for two quarters will therefore have only half the total expenditures of otherwise identical households participating for all four quarters. The NBER CEX files do not include an indicator variable for the number of quarters that the household participate in the survey, although a summary variable indicates that less than 50% of the sample completed all four surveys. After manually mergining in the exact number of quarters that the household participated in the survey, researchers reexpress the spending data on a per-quarter basis, where per-quarter spending in a given category is computed as the NBER-CEX data on spending in a given category divided by the number of quarters that the household participated in the survey.
413~D1~D1~Dataset~Consumer Expenditure Survey~Researchers made the following restrictions on the CEX sample: Researchers include only households reporting themselves as Black, White, or Hispanic. Researchers treat mixed race heads as Hispanic in the anaysis. This has no effect on the results, as the results are the same if they exclude these households. Researchers exclude households with total expenditures over $400,000 per year (in 2005 dollars). These 98 households are the top 0.1% of the total expenditures distribution. Finally, researchers exclude households that change their state of residence during the year; for which the head's education is missing (4,134 households); and for which the household's region is missing (617 households).
